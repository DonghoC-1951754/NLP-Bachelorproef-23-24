Data Partners DARWIN EU collaborates with data partner who help generate real-world evidence that can be used in scientific evaluation and regulatory decision-making. Data partner are partner who have access to raw data in-house or remotely, through ownership, public contract, third-party agreement or commercial license. Data partner enable DARWIN EU to use their data in it scientific study by executing analytic packages, and provide analysis result to the DARWIN EU Coordination Centre, in accordance with data protection and governancerules. For more information see the page. Coordination Centre The ha a key function in DARWIN EU. The CC provides a structure for developing and managing the network of data partners, including their training on process and study methods, evaluating their eligibility for performing studies, and monitoring the data quality. The CC will also be responsible for implementing and operating all the step in the , from feasibility request for study up until the final delivery of the study report to the EMA, where result are to be integrated within the EU regulatory decision making process. In addition, the Coordination Centre will be responsible for methodological development for DARWIN EU, a directed and instructed by EMA, and to interact with other relevant initiatives. The Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam wa selected a contractor in a public tendering procedure published in June 2021 to setup the Coordination Centre for the EMA. For more information see the page. European Medicines Agency The is responsible for providing leadership and direction, setting standard for DARWIN EU, contracting, instructing and overseeing the Coordination Centre and monitoring it performance. For question raised by the EU Medicines Regulatory Network requiring additional evidence to support regulatory decision-making, the EMA will coordinate the definition of the research question and define, with the requesting body, the study objective and possible study design option such a the study population, exposures, outcome and statistical measures. This information will be communicated to the Cordination Centre for a further feasibility assessment. Based on the feasibility assessment, the EMA, in consultation with the Cordination Centre, will decide on the relevance of conducting a study, specify eligibility criterion for the database to be included, identify relevant database and define the evidentiary standard to be applied in the study (e.g., data quality). The EMA will process the result of the analysis and the report of specific studies, feeding result into decision-making, a appropriate. To support the establishment of the DARWIN EU, a ha been set up by EMA. EU Medicines Regulatory Network The EU Medicines Regulatory Network includes the EMA (encompassing it scientific committee and working parties), national competent authority (NCAs) of Member States in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Commission. During the operation of DARWIN EU, the need for additional real-world evidence identified within the EU Medicines Regulatory Network to support regulatory activity will be submitted to and further discussed with EMA. Other Organisations Interactions between EMA and other organisations, institution and project can take place to improve the infrastructure, methodological standard and operational process of the DARWIN EU network. These interaction could take place with, for example: the (EHDS), of which DARWIN EU will be a key user and will need to be fully integrated and use the service provided by the EHDS; ongoing EU and national project in scope of DARWIN EU and relevant to the quality, transformation, maintenance or analysis of real-world datasets, including European networking initiative such a the (EHDEN) project, European platform for registry or the European Reference Networks (ERNs), which ha established registry platform for rare diseases; the (ENCePP) network, for integration and continuously updating of good methodological practice in pharmacoepidemiology, identification of data source and registration of studies; regulatory authority in third countries, to learn from their experience and to integrate learning such a governance and methodological aspects.

About Data AboutEuropean Health Data Space European Health Data Space DARWIN EU will connect the to the European Commission's , an initiative to promote better exchange and access to different type of health data. While the need and use case of medicine regulator and decision-makers will drive DARWIN EU's development, DARWIN EU also contributes to developing the EHDS and the joint action to deliver European principle for the secondary use of health data, known a . Acting a an early flagship 'pathfinder' for the EHDS, DARWIN EU will enable the exchange of healthcare data for use in healthcare delivery, policy-making and research across Europe, while fully complying with data protection requirements. EHDS HealthData@EU Pilot Recently, the EHDS2 Pilot Project wa initiated which will run till September 2024. This project is led by the French Health Data Hub (HDH)a French organisation that aim to ensure easy, unified, transparent and secure access to health data to improve quality of care and support for patients. Multiple consortium are involved in the EHDS pilot, from EU agency (EMA included), national platform and international research infrastructures. The consortium will aim to answer the European Commissions call for project to concretely test the EHDS in practice by creating a network of data platform at European level, by conducting cross-border research use cases, and provide recommendation for the future EHDS. The pilot project will create the first European network for secondary use of data projects, containing a metadata search portal, data access request portal and other central services. Within the network, project leader will be able to querymetadata catalogue of all node and ask for data access in several node with a single data application form. EMA will be an authorised participant and consortium partner within the EHDS2 pilot project. EMAs use case on thrombosis (see below) will aim to leverage DARWIN EU, among other platforms. DARWIN EU and the EHDS2 pilot are two complementary and synergetic project for the secondary use of health data. EMA Use Case EMAs use case will aim to investigate the natural history of coagulopathy and use of antithrombotic agent in COVID-19 patient and person vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The study ha previously been conducted via the EMA Framework Contract and the result of this study may be used for benchmarking (). This is an important use case that will test the wayDARWIN EU will be integrated in EHDS in the future. Six specific objective of the study were presented, increasing in levelof complexity, which will be chosen by data partner while considering their capability and the data they hold. It will be important to evaluate how the data from the different node will be combined, considering data available in the Common Data Model (CDM) via DARWIN EU and data available in other node in native format. It wa also clarified that the CDM is not a pre-requisite for becoming a node in the EHDS pilot. In the future, some data sources, such a some registriesfor example will not be converted into a CDM. The objective will be to see how the different data source can be combined in a single study in a meaningful way.
