But how are Member States progressing in reaching this target? According to data illustrated in Figure1 a chart showing RES progression the share of RES utilisation ha more than doubled from 2005 to 2021, successfully meeting the 2020 target of 20% from the renewable energy directive. Extrapolating data linearly beyond 2021 suggests the EU is on track to reach 32% RES by 2030.

Information for the report is collected directly from open data representative in the participating country to gather insight about the behind-the-scenes effort that power the portal and datasets we can all see and use.The outcome of this exercise is both a quantitative benchmarking of open data maturity and a compendium of success stories, best practices, and challenge that country can reference in their effort to continuously improve in this field. The report is also a summary of the state-of-play of open data across Europe for all interested stakeholders.In a sense, the maturity assessment provides respondent with a comprehensive checklist of processes, standards, and activity across several theme that should be in place to achieve a mature open data ecosystem.

Such a technology is in a mature state now and ha been increasingly adopted by industry and public institution worldwide (e.g., national libraries, museums, medium companies, and public administrations, among others). In this context,linguistic linked data (LLD) appeared a an emergenttrend within the LD field to share and interlink linguistically relevant data sources. The benefit of sharing linguistic data on the Web in a semantically interoperable manner ha been recognized by the language technology community, which ha shown increasing interest in publishing linguistic data and metadata a LLD on the Web. However, using such technology come at a price (in term of learning curve, need of technical support, etc.) that ha prevented their adoption and use on a larger scale.In this talk, they briefly review the current status of the LLD field and analyse some of their current challenge (related to sustainability issues, entry barrier to the technology, etc.). Then, a roadmap is proposed to address such challenge in order to attain an ecosystem of truly interoperable linguistic data on the Web, multilingual in nature, across different linguistic levels. Its potential role a a complementary technique to current large language model (LLM) will also be briefly discussed. Such a roadmap is one of the outcome of NexusLinguarum, the "European network for Web-centred linguistic data science" COST Action".
