The ambition of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) is to provide European researchers, innovators, company and citizen with a federated and open multi-disciplinary environment where they can publish, find and reuse data, tool and service for research, innovation and educational purposes. EOSC ultimately aim to develop a Web of FAIR Data and service for science in Europe upon which a wide range of value-added service can be built. These range from visualisation and analytics to long-term information preservation or the monitoring of the uptake of open science practices. The system resulting from the activity and initiative promoted by the European Commission to support it policy on Open Science and Open Innovation 2.0. It is a trusted system providing seamless access to data and interoperable services. It support the whole research data cycle, from discovery and mining to storage, management, analysis and re-use across border and disciplines. It consists of a set of interacting components: actors, services, data, policies, and infrastructures. It is implemented by adopting a federated, decentralised, distributed and participatory approach. The system performs function and carry out purpose that do not reside in any component alone (aka emergent behaviour). They also have EOSC Glossary They are looking for use case (link)
