The CoE-DSC aim to unlock this value by supporting organisation in realising scalable data spaces, the next evolutionary concept in data sharing.Who we areOne central hub in the Netherlands to find answer to data sharing challengesThe Centre of Excellence Data Sharing and Cloud (CoE-DSC) support organisation with establishing trust mechanism for secure and trusted data sharing, ensuring that they can tap into the business opportunity this transformative practice offers. Our mission is to unlock the true value of data sharing by supporting organisation in realising scalable data spaces, the next evolutionary concept in data sharing. Through the development of generic building block and collaborative efforts, we enable easier and cost-effective implementation of data space across sector and geographies.The CoE-DSC is the central hub in the Netherlands to find answer to data sharing challenges. We bring together the expertise and achievement of the Data Sharing Coalition, the Data Sharing working group of the Dutch AI Coalition (NL AIC), and the Gaia-X Hub Netherlands. By uniting these forces, we aim to prevent fragmentation and provide the Dutch data sharing community with a centralised hub of knowledge, tools, and expertise.Learn moreGet data sharing supportInsightsInterviewJoining force at a national level to have an influence at a European levelIn the Netherlands, there are various initiative that are working on improving the digital position of the country. How do the CoE-DSC and Topsector ICT collaborate? What are data sharing trend and how can we shape the future?Read moreInterviewThe benefit of combining data space and Privacy Enhancing TechnologiesData space and Privacy Enhancing Technologies have a common goal: making insight from data accessible in a confidential manner. But the development of both is driven by two different communities. This must change. By applying PETs within data spaces, confidentially exchanging insight from (privacy sensitive) data becomes more scalable.Read moreNewsDSSC introduces Blueprint 1.0: the evolution of data spacesThe Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC) ha announced the recent release of the Blueprint 1.0.Read moreUse casesMore use casesAdvancing data collaboration for monitoring the Dutch elderly care through MPC technologyOur participant Linksight collaborates with DSW, the municipality of Delft and elderly care organisation Pieter van Foreest and us Multi-party Computation to generate insight without sharing the data itself, which help to monitor and improve elderly care.Discover this use caseBenchmarking for industry associationsTogether with our participant SBR Nexus, data of industry association member is shared with industry association to create valuable insight about the whole sector.Discover this use caseCombining AI Entity Resolution with MPC to help combatting financial crimeTogether with participant Knights Analytics and Roseman Labs, we examined the application of Artificial Intelligence Entity Resolution technology to help combat financial crime.Discover this use caseData-driven agriculture: the value potential of data for dairy farmersTogether with our participant Impact IoT Solutions and HAN and De Marke, we examine the value potential of new data source for dairy farming and the most important condition to unlock these new data source in a use case.Discover this use caseImproved monitoring of human trafficking by sharing insightsTogether with our participant Sustainable Rescue Foundation, Roseman Labs and NGOs and other participants, we work on a use case that focus on secure data exchange between different party monitoring human trafficking.Discover this use caseLandscape: AI for administrative load reduction in the care sectorA model ha been developed that can automatically assign an ICD-10 code to half of the record a accurately a human coder can.

Traditionally, organisation establish bilateral connection or share their data through a central platform controlled by a single party. However, these approach carry the risk of vendor lock-in, fragmentation, and limited value creation.Data space are the next evolution in data sharingThe next evolution in data sharing is the concept of data spaces. A data space is a decentralised infrastructure that organisation can use to make their data accessible to others based on specific agreements. Any party adhering to these agreement can participate and exchange data. Data space offer the scalability that traditional method canoot offer, enabling greater innovation and economic and societal value. Examples of existing live data space in the Netherlands includeSCSNandHDN, a well a theMobility Data Spacein Germany.The CoE-DSC support the realisation of data spacesSignificant barrier still exist when establishing data spaces, such a building trust between participants, complying with regulations, developing governance structures, and defining business models. The CoE-DSC aim to lower these barrier and help participant realise the full potential of data sharing initiatives.Reach out to u viainfo@coe-dsc.nlif:You want to implement a use case at scale.You need technical or operational support for your data sharing initiative.You want to join our community, which consists of over 500 participants.Whilst supporting the realisation of data spaces, the CoE-DSC closely monitor the impact of the European Data Strategy and proposed regulation like the Data Act to ensure compliance, and collaborates with theData Spaces Support Centre(DSSC).Get data sharing supportOur missionOur mission is to realise a generic data sharing infrastructureThe long-term mission of the CoE-DSC is to develop a generic data sharing infrastructure that enables seamless data sharing between existing data spaces.
