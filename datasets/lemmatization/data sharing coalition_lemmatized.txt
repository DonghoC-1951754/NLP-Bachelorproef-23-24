The Data Sharing Coalition is an open and growing, international initiative in which a large variety of organisation collaborate on unlocking the value of (cross-sectoral) data sharing. Menu Centre of Excellence for Data Sharing and Cloud (CoE-DSC)The true value of data can only be realised if it is shared and re-used throughout the digital economy. The CoE-DSC aim to unlock this value by supporting organisation in realising scalable data spaces, the next evolutionary concept in data sharing.Who we areOne central hub in the Netherlands to find answer to data sharing challengesThe Centre of Excellence Data Sharing and Cloud (CoE-DSC) support organisation with establishing trust mechanism for secure and trusted data sharing, ensuring that they can tap into the business opportunity this transformative practice offers. Our mission is to unlock the true value of data sharing by supporting organisation in realising scalable data spaces, the next evolutionary concept in data sharing. Through the development of generic building block and collaborative efforts, we enable easier and cost-effective implementation of data space across sector and geographies.The CoE-DSC is the central hub in the Netherlands to find answer to data sharing challenges. We bring together the expertise and achievement of the Data Sharing Coalition, the Data Sharing working group of the Dutch AI Coalition (NL AIC), and the Gaia-X Hub Netherlands. By uniting these forces, we aim to prevent fragmentation and provide the Dutch data sharing community with a centralised hub of knowledge, tools, and expertise. Insights Parties interested in deploying a data space need to use the right technology and need to make sure they get the business and governance of the data space right. This is easier said than done, because there is relatively little guidance on how to deploy a data space successfully. What guidance can be given? In the Netherlands, there are various initiative that are working on improving the digital position of the country. How do the CoE-DSC and Topsector ICT collaborate? What are data sharing trend and how can we shape the future? Data space and Privacy Enhancing Technologies have a common goal: making insight from data accessible in a confidential manner. But the development of both is driven by two different communities. This must change. By applying PETs within data spaces, confidentially exchanging insight from (privacy sensitive) data becomes more scalable. Use case Our participant Linksight collaborates with DSW, the municipality of Delft and elderly care organisation Pieter van Foreest and us Multi-party Computation to generate insight without sharing the data itself, which help to monitor and improve elderly care. Together with our participant SBR Nexus, data of industry association member is shared with industry association to create valuable insight about the whole sector. Together with participant Knights Analytics and Roseman Labs, we examined the application of Artificial Intelligence Entity Resolution technology to help combat financial crime. Together with our participant Impact IoT Solutions and HAN and De Marke, we examine the value potential of new data source for dairy farming and the most important condition to unlock these new data source in a use case. Together with our participant Sustainable Rescue Foundation, Roseman Labs and NGOs and other participants, we work on a use case that focus on secure data exchange between different party monitoring human trafficking. A model ha been developed that can automatically assign an ICD-10 code to half of the record a accurately a human coder can. For the remainder, the coder is given suggestions, simplifying the coding work and further training the model.

Frequently Asked Questions The CoE-DSC function a a central hub for market player seeking solution to develop trust in data sharing by providing access to relevant tools, knowledge, and best practices. The CoE-DSC is an open collaborative initiative seeking alignment with sectoral data sharing initiative avoid fragmentation in solutions. CoE-DSC combine all knowledge and expertise that ha been developed within the Working Group Data Sharing of the NL AIC, the Data Sharing Coalition, and the Gaia-X Hub NL, and provides access to open-source components, standard and implementation that are currently available in the market. At the moment, further information on the tool and guideline can be found on the website of the original initiatives. All document can be downloaded on the website of the original initiatives. Links to existing tool and guideline are:Furthermore, we are currently working on creating an inventory of reusable open-source components, standards, and implementation available in the market. Members of the CoE-DSC community get the opportunity to participate in the development of (cross-sectoral) data sharing use case with support from expert andtools, gain and share knowledge about (cross-sectoral) data sharing through participation in various activity organized by the CoE-DSC and collaborate with other participants.This mean being involved in new initiative and projects, and becoming part of an open and active community that will enrich your network. No membership fee is charged to CoE-DSC community members. However, we do ask an in-kind commitment from our community members. In-kind commitment consists of actively contributing to the knowledge community by attending community activities, a well a participating in the development of data sharing use cases.

Traditionally, organisation establish bilateral connection or share their data through a central platform controlled by a single party. However, these approach carry the risk of vendor lock-in, fragmentation, and limited value creation.Data space are the next evolution in data sharingThe next evolution in data sharing is the concept of data spaces. A data space is a decentralised infrastructure that organisation can use to make their data accessible to others based on specific agreements. Any party adhering to these agreement can participate and exchange data. Data space offer the scalability that traditional method canoot offer, enabling greater innovation and economic and societal value. Examples of existing live data space in the Netherlands includeand, a well a thein Germany.The CoE-DSC support the realisation of data spacesSignificant barrier still exist when establishing data spaces, such a building trust between participants, complying with regulations, developing governance structures, and defining business models. The CoE-DSC aim to lower these barrier and help participant realise the full potential of data sharing initiatives.Reach out to u via if:You want to implement a use case at scale.You need technical or operational support for your data sharing initiative.You want to join our community, which consists of over 500 participants.Whilst supporting the realisation of data spaces, the CoE-DSC closely monitor the impact of the European Data Strategy and proposed regulation like the Data Act to ensure compliance, and collaborates with the(DSSC). Our missionOur mission is to realise a generic data sharing infrastructureThe long-term mission of the CoE-DSC is to develop a generic data sharing infrastructure that enables seamless data sharing between existing data spaces. By promoting interoperability, party from different sector and domain can efficiently share data and unlock new use case with economic and societal value.By working on practical data sharing use case and gathering expertise from our participants, we take tangible step towards realising this mission.We are an open and inclusive initiative.
