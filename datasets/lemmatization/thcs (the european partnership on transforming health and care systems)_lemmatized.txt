Furthermore, our system share challenge that require harmonised and coordinated solutions, devised through a process that allows all stakeholder involved in health and care system to design, research and implement such issue in a timely manner.Within this context, we need to identify how health and care system can achieve such harmonised responses. This Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) defines the framework on which the Partnership for transforming health and care system (THCS) is set to respond to this context, building on it solid background, existing key initiative in the field, and common vision: to maintain and improve people health in Europe and participating country by supporting the transformation of health and care system to achieve high-quality, fairly accessible, sustainable, efficient, resilient and inclusive health and care system for all.To move towards the realisation of it vision, the Partnership will focus on it ambition to address and trigger global and long-term change in the complex health and care research and innovation ecosystems. More specifically, the objective will be reached by embracing the whole knowledge and innovation cycle, with a specific focus on the need to foster implementation, inform policy and practice, and provide the necessary input for improving health and care capacity. This will be achieved through a Partnership in which all stakeholder can work together to stimulate and nurture research and innovation activities.As indicated in Chapter 3 of this SRIA, the achievement of the abovementioned goal will be enshrined in a series of specific objective to be achieved by 2030: increase funding opportunity and strengthen the research and innovation community; fill knowledge gaps; increase the ability to implement innovation; intensify cooperation among country and beyond healthcare; and increase stakeholder involvement.These objectives, through a series of specific activities, will seek to deliver clear outcomes. They include: increased engagement of researcher in collaborative research; use of research result to develop evidence-based strategies; implementation of innovative care delivery methods; planning and implementation of efficient investment for novel solution and models; stronger ecosystem and boosted uptake of innovation; increased digital and health literacy for citizen and professionals; and, ultimately, better cooperation and use of knowledge and evidence across countries. The SRIA also identifies specific impact for key stakeholder categories, highlighting the concrete improvement the Partnership can bring.Within such a broad and complex topic, prioritisation and framing are essential. Chapter 4 of the SRIA address this issue, identifying clear thematic priority set against framework that include efficiency and sustainability, quality and safety, digitalisation, people need and user involvements, and the health and care workforce. Such framework are closely intertwined with the specific health and care sector demanding attention and change, including long-term care, primary care, and the redefinition of hospital care.Chapter 4 also lay out the Partnership roadmap. This is developed around three overarching work stream that address the specific objective and describe the ambitious outcome expected within the agreed time frame: filling knowledge gaps; implementing and transferring solutions; and boosting health and care system capabilities. To progress from these work stream to implementation and results, the SRIA also identifies a tentative roadmap with short-, medium- and long-term objective linked to expected 2030 results.This lead u to the implementation approach of the Partnership, which is presented in Chapter 5 alongside the organisational structure of the Partnership. In brief, the identification of the problem and challenge to be addressed, together with the definition of any missing knowledge, will help identify the priority topic to be included in the Partnerships Annual Work Plans. Existing practice will need to be regularly mapped to avoid any duplication of efforts, to help tailor the best actions, and to understand context-based obstacle and barrier to implementation and transfer. Addressing research and innovation funding will be a core issue for the Partnership and sustainable mechanism for the alignment of resource will be promoted.Within this framework, the Partnerships implementation will be guided by a set of principles: joint investment in health and care research and innovation; co-creation, capacity-building and science- policy cooperation across all activity and instruments; the establishment of a knowledge hub for ecosystem development support; international cooperation and broader participation with selected country in order to compare approaches, test solutions, exploit results, exchange experience and needs, and support the transfer of knowledge; strategy development to strengthen programme management, dissemination, and exploitation.Finally, a the Partnership's endeavour will not achieve the desired result on their own, the SRIA map out the main synergy that the Partnership will seek and foster with other EU initiatives, from Horizon Europe to the EU4Health Programme, covering other important partnership and funding stream such a the Innovative Health Initiative and the European Social Fund+.SRIA OverviewExploreDocumentationAuthorsThis Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) wa written by the core team of the Transforming Health and Care Systems Candidate Partnership in cooperation with the European Commission (DG RTD, DG CONNECT, DG SANTE).

As such, person- and people-centredness not only requires involving people to explore their need and become more empowered, but also a system-wide reassessment and redesign of professional orientation and service organisation to adjust to the need of people and their abilities, rather than the other way around.To address the increasing challenge and fill the knowledge and innovation gap and specific objectives, it is important to support research and innovation action addressing all dimension of health and care systems:Quality of care: safety, effectiveness, patient-centredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity.Accessibility: approachability, acceptability, availability and accommodation, affordability, appropriateness, equity, and one-way entry and navigation in a well-integrated, people-centred and de-siloed system.Sustainability: long-term strategic perspective and innovativeness, disease prevention and health promotion, rehabilitation, quality, financial sustainability, institutionalisation of environmental concerns, and institutional accountability and individual responsibility.Efficiency: cost-effectiveness and value for money.Resilience: knowledge, management of uncertainties, interdependence, legitimacy.Inclusiveness: diversity-sensitive, non-discriminatory, stigma-free.Within the overarching theme of people-centred health and care systems, particular issue are centred around creating condition that enable people a service users, patients, carers, their families, and community to play a more central and directing role in their own care a well a in shaping the system that serf them. It also touch upon the implication of personalised medicine for individual and society that will have considerable implication for how health and care system are organised and funded.Several key question can be considered while focusing on this overarching priority:What are the most effective approach to engagement that consider people value and preferences? These should take into consideration the individual person-professional relationship, the organisation, the co-creation of innovation, the governance and financing, and the wider societal perspective to implementing people-centred strategies.What are the most effective investment strategy for supporting the public (e.g. patients, clinicians, or decision-makers) to acquire the skill and ability for critical engagement, to express their need and understand risks?How do we ensure optimised link between the different tier of the health and care system to guarantee the systematic and systemic implementation of effective people-centred strategies?Which type of measure can best increase health literacy and digital literacy by targeting people and/or health and care professionals?How should preventive and curative service be designed for those with lower health literacy and fewer possibility for self-management?How should the potential of health promotion and disease prevention be unlocked by mean of concrete strategies, involving multiple actor and sectors?What measure are effective to support informal carers?What are the skill and contextual condition needed to deliver personalised medicine, and how will personalised medicine affect health and care in the future?Consistent with the shift towards more people- and population-centred health and care, a holistic and outcome-based approach that focus on rigorous measure to ass and improve the quality of health and care is becoming increasingly important.SRIA OverviewExploreSearchCo-funded by the European unionFunded by the European Union under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme - Grant Agreement N: 101095654.
