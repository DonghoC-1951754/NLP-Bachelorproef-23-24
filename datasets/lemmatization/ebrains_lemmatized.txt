Operations underpinning realtime SNN execution are presented, including an event-based operating system facilitating efficient time-driven neuron state update and pipelined event-driven spike processing. Preprocessing, realtime execution, and neuron/synapse model implementation are discussed, all in the context of a simple example SNN. Simulation result are demonstrated, together with performance profiling providing insight into how software interacts with the underlying hardware to achieve realtime execution. System performance is shown to be within a factor of 2 of the original design target of 10,000 synaptic event per millisecond, however SNN topology is shown to influence performance considerably. A cost model is therefore developed characterizing the effect of network connectivity and SNN partitioning. This model enables user to estimate SNN simulation performance, allows the SpiNNaker team to make prediction on the impact of performance improvements, and help demonstrate the continued potential of the SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware.

The combination of brain research with supercomputing in large-scale, multi-disciplinary research collaboration ha enabled an innovative approach to deciphering the brain, using powerful scientific technology and data ressources. These development open up new possibility for brain research, medicine and technology. A position paper by over 100 authors, now published in the journal Imaging Neuroscience, summarises the current status and identifies the key point for further development in digital neuroscience.Digital technology have fundamentally changed neuroscience in recent years. The challenge posed by increasingly large and complex data have been met with innovative shared platform and novel tool for scientific investigation. Large-scale research initiative within Europe and worldwide have shaped these development and enabled synergy in scientific efforts. Examples include the EU Flagship , and it digital research infrastructure EBRAINS, which enable scientist to integrate data from different scale according to FAIR principles, use model and software at EBRAINS for gaining new insight and working collaboratively on a larger scale. This change ha led to significant progress and offer the opportunity to advance neuroscience, medicine and brain-inspired technologies.Against this background, the position paper titled is primarily intended a a roadmap for digital neuroscience over the next ten years."It is crucial that we assess, anticipate and shape the change occuring in neuroscience and it related fields. The position paper identifies point of convergence and common goals, and provides a scientific framework for current and future development in digital brain research based on a structured process of discussion with the research community at large."Prof. Katrin AmuntsDirector at the Jlich Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine and Joint CEO of EBRAINSThe position paper list a total of eight key area for digital neuroscience research. Near-term, middle-term and long-term goal are discussed, a well a novel development like digital twin-approaches, with their applicability, potential and limitation in brain science. A digital twin is a type of personalised computational brain model that can be continuously updated with measured data obtained from it real-life counterpart, i.e., the patient. While not aimed at being an exact replica, the increasing sophistication and predictive power of these model is bringing new clinical and research application into reach.Further key area described in the paper include ultra-high-resolution digital atlas and model of the brain that integrate multiple scale and modalities, neuro-derived artificial intelligence (AI) and computing innovations. EBRAINS ha a key role in the interaction between brain research and computing, offering scientist access to the most powerful European supercomputer via the computing network and to the brain-inspired computing system and . An ha been published on the website of the EBRAINS research infrastructure.How the position paper came aboutTwo year ago, the HBP initiated an open and community-driven process integrating the view of researcher around the world. A first version by around 40 author wa published on the open publication platform in March 2022 with a call to scientists, in particular outside the HBP, to contribute further perspectives.

In this interview, the lead author, internationally renowned brain researcher Prof. Katrin Amunts, give an insight into the content and origin of the paper.Prof. Katrin Amunts is Director at the Jlich Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Director of the Ccile and Oskar Vogt Institute for Brain Research at Heinrich Heine University Dsseldorf and Joint CEO of EBRAINS. From 2016 to 2023, she wa Scientific Director of the Human Brain Project.Prof. Amunts, why is brain research so demanding?Katrin Amunts: The brain is one of the most complex system known to man. We study the brain on several spatial and temporal scale - from individual molecule to the whole brain and subject-level. Furthermore, it change and adapts throughout life - this happens within millisecond to over the entire lifespan. The many different scale must be considered together to develop a comprehensive understanding of brain structure and function.What change have had a decisive impact on neuroscience in recent years?The way in which brain research is conducted ha changed fundamentally. Digital technology and new instruments, tool and method have transformed the field. One example is our three-dimensional brain atlas, which ha now become a kind of Google Maps. It doe not only offer detailed map of the brain, but also a large amount of data and software to work with. Digitalisation ha opened many door between the silo of the various subdisciplines in brain research and brain-related field in recent years. In addition, new, large-scale collaboration within Europe and worldwide are creating synergy based on the shared use of data and instruments. They thus take account of the great dynamism in research. The change ha led to important advance and open up new opportunity to advance brain research, medicine and brain-inspired technologies.What is the background of the creation of the position paper?The development of new digital method is changing research rapidly, and in the case of AI and most recently, large language models, this is happening faster than many of u expected. These advance were made possible by stronger and more powerful computers, and digitalisation. We now have the basis to delve much deeper into research. At the same time, this also open up new questions. It is crucial that we evaluate, anticipate and help shape such developments. In this way, we can maximize the opportunity and overcome the challenge of the next decade for research and it application, taking into account the ethical and social aspects. The paper provides the framework for this, a kind of "scientific roadmap".The position paper wa developed in several stages. How exactly?Two year ago, the HBP initiated an open and collaborative exchange of scientific opinion and data for researcher around the world, resulting in the position paper that ha now been published. A first version by around 40 scientist wa published on the open publication platform in March 2022, with a call for researcher outside the HBP in particular to contribute further perspectives. The paper grew from edition to edition. The fifth and final version with over 100 author ha now been published in the journal Imaging Neuroscience. They come not only from Europe, but also from the USA, Canada and Asia.What are example of goal for digital neuroscience in the coming decade?The paper identifies a total of eight key area for research. One example of a medical application is the so-called "digital twin": twin are computer-based, mathematical brain model that can be continuously updated with measurement data. They are not a similar to the original a they sound, a a model always mean an abstraction. But even simplified model can help u to better understand specific mechanism and are making prediction that can be clinically relevant. Personalized model will increasingly enable u to improve diagnostics and therapy. For example, research originating from the HBP is the basis to investigate the use of the "digital twin" for better planning of surgical intervention for epilepsy. Virtual brain also enable u to test fundamental research hypothesis about the organization of our most complex organ, and at the same time pave the way for innovative neuro-inspired technologies.What role doe the EBRAINS research infrastructure play in this?EBRAINS emerged from the work of the HBP. This new digital and collaborative research infrastructure enables the integration of data provided by different research group from different country and with different approach and make it accessible to others for their research projects. EBRAINS offer a wide range of different digital tool and service to support neuroscientists, that can be combined in a flexible way. Compute- and data- intensive workflow can make use of powerful European supercomputer such a those of the Jlich Supercomputing Center JSC, the CEA in France or CINECA in Italy, which are part of a dedicated compute infrastructure called Fenix.What will be the relation between artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscientific research over the next ten years?AI-based method are becoming a more and more powerful tool for neuroscientists. Foundation model are changing research in a way that is expected to address completely new questions. At the same time, we should explore how to overcome some of the limit that these method have, e.g., by learning from the brain. Such a transfer ha happened already. Some neuro-inspired network have already shown remarkable characteristics, for example, they learn faster and with le training data. Findings from brain research are also being applied to the development of new hardware - for example, in BrainScaleS and SpiNNaker, which are among the most powerful neuromorphic system today. They emerged from the HBP and have shown very intriguing advantage in domain like real-time processing and energy efficiency. Now they are available on EBRAINS.Original publication:K. Amunts L.

IMAGE: Heidelberg UniversityIn a new study enabled by the EBRAINS research infrastructure, a team at Heidelberg University (Germany) made advance in the field of neuromorphic engineering, enhancing the platform BrainScaleS-2 and paving the way for high-speed robotics.Their work, detailed in a , introduced a real-time spike interface to the neuromorphic platform BrainScaleS-2 (BSS-2). This innovation enables advancement in high-speed robotics applications, due to a 1,000-fold acceleration of the emulated nerve cells.The biological brain show very high speed and efficiency when processing complex operation and enabling cognitive functions. Neuromorphic computing try to replicate aspect of the structure and function of the brain to achieve this efficiency, and hold promise for robotics applications.Robotics can benefit from spiking neural network (SNNs) due to them being more energy-efficient than traditional neural networks, and because their biological inspiration can lead to better cognitive capability in robotics systems. SNNs are also capable of processing information in precise timing, which is crucial for task such a motion detection or speech recognition in robotics.The BrainScaleS-2 system is a neuromorphic platform with versatile application in the field of computational neuroscience and spike-based machine learning. It is based on emulation of neurons, running at 1,000x biological real-time speed and available a a single-chip system. This acceleration allows the system to tackle robotic task far beyond human speed, enabling precise timing on a microsecond scale. Researchers have free access to the system via .In a demonstration of the capability of this new interface, the researcher used machine-learning technique to train a spiking neural network (SNN) an artificial neural network that mimic a biological one emulated on the BSS-2 platform to control a type of electric motor.Yannik Stradmann, a researcher at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics (Heidelberg University) and author of the paper, emphasis the versatility of the newly enhanced system: The interaction of an artificial brain, processing information 1,000 time faster than humans, with the real world give rise to many interesting scientific and technological questions. We envision this platform to enable future research on self-supervised and biologically inspired online learning for such applications.The interaction of an artificial brain, processing information 1,000 time faster than humans, with the real world give rise to many interesting scientific and technological questions.
