The main objective of the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform) is to cope with the enormous fragmentation of rare disease (RD) patient data contained in hundred of registry across Europe. The Platform make RD registries' data searchable and findable, thus increasing visibility for each registry, maximising the value of each registry's information and enabling extended use and re-use of registries' data. This is ensured by the European RD Registry Infrastructure (ERDRI), which support existing registry and the creation of new registries. The EU RD Platform set EU-level standard for RD data collection and data exchange and provides training on the use of the tool and service offered. In addition to ERDRI, the EU RD Platform includes a data repository composed of the European RD Registry Data Warehouse (under preparation), the JRC-EUROCAT Central Registry and the JRC-SCPE Central Registry. The EU RD Platform is open to all RD registries. Its final goal is to act a a knowledge generation centre benefiting healthcare provider including European Reference Networks, researchers, patient and policy-makers in the common effort to improve diagnosis and treatment for patient living with a rare disease.
