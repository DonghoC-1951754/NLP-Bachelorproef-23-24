AMdEX is not limited to Amsterdam, but aspires an (inter)national function. The development is fully committed to cooperation with the national government and the European Commission. We foresee a global network of similar data exchange. Other data sharing initiativesAMdEX distinguishes itself by acknowledging that it is not a standalone solution for all data sharing issues. Recognising the complexity of data sovereignty, AMdEX understands that technical, semantic and interface interoperability challenge also need to be addressed. In this regard, AMdEX encourages collaboration with other initiative such a GAIA-X, iShare, IDS, Fiware and many more. By engaging in collaboration with these initiatives, AMdEX aim to coordinate development plan and ensure alignment in solving the broader challenge related to data sharing.
