Platform for RWE project (RWD!) for hospital (data owners) prepare, validate, anonymise and harmonise data project outcome are shared with all member involved ARWEN is committed to build a European data network ARWEN make your real-world data (RWD) more actionable: generating insight in a way that s fast, scalable and transparent. With ARWEN collecting, standardising and analysing RWD for treatment improvement project is no longer a struggle. arrow_backInsightsProjectsHow it worksSponsorEnglish-->EnglishEspaolNederlandsENexpand_moreEnglishEspaolNederlandsLet's talkArobust platformthat convert different type ofhospital and patient dataintoreal-world evidenceWe prepare and pre-validate data and harmonise them to a common data model with a low burden for hospitals.Lets talkJoin onceLegal matter and data collection should not be part of individual treatment improvement projects. They should be done once and for all, giving back time and pace to the projects. ARWEN make this a reality.THE ARWEN DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENTOurlegal frameworkguarantee hospital keep full ownership of their data. This eliminates the need to go through this legal process with each new project.benefit continuouslyParticpants dont need to go through data setup process for each new project.Join more meaningful treatment improvement project faster.1WE SUPPORT BETTER HEALTHCARE WITHDATAANALYTICSWeprepare, validate, anonymise and harmonise datafrom multiple disease group to a common model for efficient analysis of the data. This allows u to deliver ready-to-use Real-World Evidence, with a minimal burden for your hospital.ARWEN member can elect to participate intreatment improvement projects, while we support them in answering their own question through data analytics.We have 15+ year of experience with hospital data. Our scalabledata modelsbring together patient pathway mapping, medicine uptake, clinical & patient outcomes, activity-based cost and more.2OUR PROJECT PROTOCOL ARE SHAPED IN COOPERATIONWe propose a continuously evolving selection of focal therapeutic areas. We connect ARWEN partner from the healthcare and life science world who want to answer key question and stimulate informed decision-making.Foreach treatment improvement project, we involve suitable group of healthcare provider that want to participate, based on their hospital profile and therapeutic focus. This way, we ensure the project lead to meaningful result that are relevant for everyone involved.3INVOLVED HOSPITALS HAVE ACCESS TO ALL RELEVANT INSIGHTS THAT COME OUT OF THE TREATMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECTSIn ARWEN projects, project outcomesare shared with all the member involved. This make your participation in ARWEN more rewarding.Whatreal-worlddata is supported?OUR CORE DATA SETSThe core data set represent the backbone of every ARWEN analytics project. They allow u to identify and structure the granular medical activities, care pathways, medicine prescriptions, clinical outcome and more.Claims and care activity dataThis essential data set includes patient-level granular data on the single activity performed to treat patients, such a operations, hospitalisation time, diagnostics, consultations, etc.Clustering and sequencing these activity allow, for instance, to generate of real-world patient pathways.Prescription dataPharmacy data provides detail on the types, dosage and volume of drug prescribed.CROsClinician-Reported Outcomes include different type of quality indicators, such a reoperation rates, complications, time to next treatment, etc.ADD-ON DATA SETSThese data set are optional layer that can enhance the core ones. They can be utilised for specific study protocol and typically require advanced data models.PROsPatient Reported Outcomes refer to condition-specific indicator on the patient physical and mental status.Pathology & lab dataWhile the occurrence of specific pathology & lab test is included in the care activity data, this data set discloses detail on the result of pathology exams, such a blood tests, urinalysis, molecular pathology and more.Other diagnostics dataWhile the occurrence of specific diagnostics is included in the care activity data, this data set give clarity on the result of additional diagnostic exams, such a X-rays, MRIs, CT scan and more.Genomics dataDNA data can be crossed with other data set to enable advanced insight on gene-based patient segmentation and support the discovery and development of precision therapy practice and medicines.At LOGEX, we are expert data handler and analysistsWe have structured and routinised tool and practice for data extraction, linkage and validationDuring the process of validation, data is thoroughly reviewed ensure it validity and prepare it for useFor all LOGEX client hospitals, they are already validated, structured and processed, allowing to limit effort and cut execution time continuously working to bring you more data sources.We have experience across a wide range of data-sets, from clinical registry to patient-level financial dataEach study will be based on a set of core data set and, on optional add-on data setsWhoowns the datain ARWENData governance is really important for us: data will always belong to hospitals.Your data is yoursYou are not our product, and neither is your data.We are data analysts, not data brokerYour data is safeThe privacy and security of your data always come first.We hold ourselves to the same standard a you doYour data is valuableHow you unlock the value in your data, is your choice.We work to turn data into value, in full transparencyYour data is vitalYour data hold the potential to fast-track crucial research.We are proud to be a highly respected & trusted third partyHow doesthe ARWEN data modelwork?Differently from clinical trials, real-world data is not perfect and present large variation across providers, region and countries.As ARWEN is committed to build a comparable European data network, robust data model and policy must be established.Well-designed data specifications, a thorough validation process and smart algorithm utilised by ARWEN can turn the complexity of real-world data into tangible insights.Becoming a member of ARWEN takesonly two months.Lets talkSign up for the newsletterPlease enter your email below to sign up for the newsletter.Your email addressPrivacy statementARWEN is powered byThis website us functional cooky that are necessary for the operation of the website.
