Some of these data could be used to replicate or extend previous research findings; others could be combined with additional data to enable researcher to analyze the result from a larger number of patients. All of it can be used to address secondary research question to generate new knowledge. The challenge facing the clinical research enterprise ha been to develop a sustainable method for qualified researcher and clinician to access these data and utilize them to advance science. Sharing clinical data that are already in existence is an efficient use of collective scientific resource and maximizes the valuable contribution of those who volunteer to participate in research. The Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) Project at theadvocates for the responsible sharing of clinical research data. The Project is committed to open science and data transparency, and support research attempting to produce concrete benefit to patients, the medical community, and society a a whole. Through experience and input from the public and stakeholders, the YODA Project ha iteratively developed a model to make data available to researcher in a sustainable way, in which data sharing becomes a part of the clinical research enterprise of the future. The mission of the YODA Project is to not only increase access to clinical research data, but to promote it use to generate new knowledge. with Dr. Harlan Krumholz on open science and the YODA Project. Side navigation Policies & Procedures Data Partners Johnson & Johnson Medtronic Conferences website designed by The YODA Project Menu About Policies & Procedures Data Partners Johnson & Johnson Medtronic Conferences Request Request Data Metrics Data Requests Inquiries and CSR Summaries Policies & Procedures to Guide External Investigator Access to Clinical Trial Data Policy to Guide External Investigator Access to Clinical Trial Data The Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) Project is an effort by a group of academically-based clinical researcher to promote and facilitate the sharing of clinical trial data. This set of policies, which represents a refinement of policy that guided access to data made available by Medtronic, Inc., is intended not only to cover the YODA Projects partnership with Johnson & Johnson, but also to set standard that will be relevant to future effort with similar aspirations. Importantly, the YODA Project ha the final decision-making right regarding these policy and, by extension, the granting or denial of data requests, a per the contractual agreement between the YODA Project and it partners. By serving this role, the YODA Projects goal is to enhance data availability and transparency in support of strong scientific research which aim to advance scientific and medical knowledge with the ultimate goal of improving public health and healthcare delivery. This document outline the YODA Projects policy to guide it decision-making related to granting access to these data. The YODA Project seek to continually improve these policy and, accordingly, may modify the policy in the future. What is the YODA Project? The YODA Project is an effort by a group of academically-based clinical researcher to facilitate access to participant-level clinical research data and/or comprehensive report of clinical research, such a full Clinical Study Reports (CSRs), a level of detail not customarily found in journal publications, with the aim of promoting scientific research that may advance science or lead to improvement in individual and public health and healthcare delivery. The YODA Project is guided by the following core principles, which reflect the overall mission of the project to promote open science by: Promoting the sharing of clinical research data to advance science and improve public health and healthcarePromoting the responsible conduct of researchEnsuring good stewardship of clinical research dataProtecting the right of research participant Policy Scope:This data release policy applies to all request received by the YODA Project for access to clinical trial data held by a third party with whom the YODA Project ha an agreement to serve in a decision-making role regarding the granting or denial of these requests. This policy address the research proposal requirements, data receipt, data analysis, and dissemination of results. Specifically, the policy guide the procedure that will be used to make completed clinical trial data (including both CSRs and participant-level data) available to external investigator for independent scientific examination. This policy doe not apply to request for research partnership or other type of data, such a biological, pharmacological, or radiographic data, which are beyond the scope of the YODA Project. This policy wa informed by the following: The YODA Projects prior experience with sharing Medtronics participant-level clinical trial data for recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2);Recommendations from the YODA Project Steering Committee, an independent group of leader in the field of clinical research and biomedical ethic convened by the YODA Project to provide guidance;Recommendations from other experts, stakeholders, and industry partners; andThe YODA Projects review of the literature and policy from other body engaged in clinical trial data sharing. Policy Statement:The YODA Project is committed to facilitating external access to clinical trial data being made available by third party Data Partners to promote research that informs science and public health. The project doe not support request to use data for non-scientific purposes, such a in pursuit of litigation or for commercial interests. The YODA Project will require that requestors provide basic information about the Principal Investigator, Key Personnel, and the project Research Proposal, including a scientific abstract and research methods. Registration information will be used by the YODA Project to track use of the data, promote the responsible conduct of research, and to publicly post information about who ha obtained access to the data and for what scientific purpose. The YODA Project will review proposal to ensure that the proposal ha scientific merit, in that 1) the scientific purpose is clearly described; 2) the data requested will be used to create or materially enhance generalizable scientific and/or medical knowledge to inform science and public health; and 3) the proposed research can be reasonably addressed using the requested data. Scientific review by peer expert and/or member of the YODA Project Steering Committee may be solicited if the YODA Project is unable to verify the scientific merit of the proposal. The YODA Project will request a Due Diligence Assessment by the Data Partner if the requested data are not currently available in a secure data sharing platform in order to determine it ability to make the data available to be shared externally, including estimation of the resource that would be required. Requestors may similarly request such an Assessment for data that are not yet available prior to preparing a full proposal. Requests that include independent funding will be considered, but are neither expected nor required. The YODA Project willall request and registration information, including the Research Proposal and analysis plan, a summary of the Data Partner Due Diligence Assessment, any scientific review from peer expert or the YODA Project Steering Committee, and the YODA Projects decision to grant or deny data access. If access is denied, a public report detailing the reason(s) will be provided. Public posting is intended to promote transparency of clinical research and public accountability of the YODA Project data release process. Prior to receiving data access, requestors will be asked to sign a Data Use Agreement (DUA). The DUA explicitly state that access to the data will be used to create or materially enhance generalizable scientific knowledge and that finding derived from analysis will initially be publicly disseminated only through the peer-reviewed biomedical literature or scientific meetings, with the exception of unexpected or serious safety finding (which should be reported to the Data Partner immediately for further evaluation and reporting to appropriate health or regulatory authorities). In addition, the requestors must certify not to use or enable others to use the data for commercial purpose or in pursuit of litigation. Released data will include all data relevant to the Research Proposal that are available, including collected participant-level data set (appropriately de-identified a per current regional standard to protect patient privacy), annotated case report forms, data set specifications, protocol with any amendments, reporting and analysis plans, and complete CSRs. Depending on the Data Partner, data will be made available either via a password-protected personalized account on a secure data sharing platform or a secure electronic data transfer system.

These comment are available below. The policy and procedure were informed by the following: The YODA Projects prior experience with sharing Medtronics participant-level clinical trial data for recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2);Recommendations from the YODA Project Steering Committee, an independent group of leader in the field of clinical research and biomedical ethic convened by the YODA Project to provide guidance;Recommendations from other experts, stakeholders, and industry partners; andThe YODA Projects review of the literature and policy from other body engaged in clinical trial data sharing. All public comment were taken into consideration, but incorporated at the discretion of the YODA Project. The YODA Project seek to continually improve these policy and, accordingly, may modify the policy in the future.

The primary purpose of the Due Diligence Assessment is for the Data Partner to provide the YODA Project with an assessment of it ability to make the data available to be shared externally, reviewing the Data Partners legal and regulatory consideration in order to determine if they have legal and ethical right to make the data available to external investigator for scientific purposes. However, the Due Diligence Assessment will also include estimation of the resource that would be required to make the data available to external requestors, such a the time and effort required to de-identify data in compliance with current regional standard to protect patient privacy and prepare the necessary accompanying documentation, providing an understanding of the technical consideration for the release of older clinical trial data that do not exist in an easily shareable format. The rationale for collecting this information is to broadly inform the field with estimate of resource required by Data Partners to make data available. The Due Diligence Assessment will also include determination a to whether other researchers, either internally employed by or externally affiliated with the Data Partner, are engaged in similar research studies. The rationale for making this determination is so that external requestors are made aware of similar ongoing research effort (so that there are no misunderstanding about generation of research ideas), a well a to foster collaborations. Requests for data that are already listed a available on the YODA Project website will undergo a Due Diligence Assessment by the Data Partner for this purpose only. Lastly, the Due Diligence Assessment ass whether the proposed research can be reasonably addressed using the requested data, including whether the variable needed for the proposed analysis are included in the requested data and whether the research question can be addressed using summary-level data.

Many issue and idea arose throughout the development process that required careful consideration by the YODA Project on how to move forward. The YODA Project spent the past few month determining how best to handle the following question and situations: How to fulfill a data request when the requested data were generated many year ago and are not in shareable data files? Much clinical trial data generated prior to 1990 may only be available in paper format and not readily accessible.There will be request for data that cannot legally or ethically be filled. For instance, data request for which the privacy and confidentiality of research participant and their data cannot be protected or the clinical trial informed consent doe not allow the sharing of de-identified data for public health research or educational purpose cannot be filled. Additionally, data request for a compound that ha been obtained from or ha been developed in collaboration with an external partner will require agreement on data sharing from all involved partner before a request can be approved.How much time and effort is required for appropriate data de-identification a per current regional standard to protect patient privacy a well a preparation of the necessary accompanying documentation before the data are made available? The YODA Project implemented a staged approach to data access to better understand the time, effort and data format necessary to release clinical trial data. This data release pilot project included a Due Diligence Assessment by Janssen Pharmaceuticals to ass the following: Its ability to make the data available to be shared externally, including providing an understanding of the technical consideration for the release of older clinical trial data that do not exist in an easily shareable formatThe informed consent documentation from clinical trial of interest to ensure that the right and privacy of research participant are upheldThe time and effort required for appropriate data de-identification a per current regional standard to protect patient privacy a well a preparation of the necessary accompanying documentation The result of this pilot project have helped to inform and improve the YODA Project data release process.

Medtronic wa the first company to contract with the YODA Project to allow access to all of it clinical trial data for independent reanalysis, a tremendous step forward in the emerging era of open science. As part of this initiative, the YODA Project first contracted with two independent research group that were competitively selected to review and meta-analyze all clinical study of Medtronics rhBMP-2. The Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland, Oregon, and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York, United Kingdom, were selected. More information about these outstanding research group can be found. With the publication of their independent, peer-reviewed review and meta-analyses, both a comprehensive report and in theAnnals of Internal Medicine, Medtronics rhBMP-2 clinical trial data were made available to other investigator who wished to pursue scientific research, either to address unanswered question or to reproduce the work conducted by OHSU and York. These data were available for investigator to request from June 2013-June 2015. This initiative wa an important step toward more open science, whereby industry, investigators, and regulator pursue more transparent and collaborative pathway of clinical trial research, ensuring that patient and physician have the best possible understanding of medical product effectiveness and safety.

After a competitive and open process, Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) and the University of York were selected. OHSU and the University of York completed independent review of the entire body of scientific evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). The team had full access to all Medtronics clinical trial, post-marketing and safety data about rhBMP-2. OHSU and University of York independently developed final report based on their analysis of the rhBMP-2 data (links to the report are available below). These report were formally reviewed by expert member of the YODA Project Steering Committees, including orthopedic surgeons, statisticians, and expert in clinical trial design and analysis, a well a by representative from the manufacturer of rhBMP-2, Medtronic, Inc. The center refined their report based on reviewer feedback and peer-review comment made on their manuscripts. Their aim included the following: Identify all relevant studies, across all user and sponsor (i.e., Medtronic sponsored and others).Determine the question that were addressed by these studies.Evaluate the quality of the studies. Assess the risk of bias associated with the design, conduct, and reporting of each clinical study, including those identified via the systematic review and those provided by Medtronic, and, if present, how bias may have affected assessment of effectiveness and harms.Assessment of study design and conduct should include evaluation of internal validity, method used to ascertain outcome and other policy and procedure for data collection, a well a the integrity of case report form (CRF) adjudication.Assessment of study reporting should include selective publication and selective reporting.Summary of these finding should include:What conclusion can be drawn by assessing the full body of data and what gap in knowledge remain, taking into account result from the evaluation of quality and risk of biasAn assessment of applicability of these studies.Conduct meta-analyses from study identified via the systematic review, if appropriate and using patient-level data, if possible. If not appropriate, there should be another approach to summarizing the data. The analysis should consider the following:For effectiveness, meta-analysis should consider patient-centered outcome (i.e., quality of life and functional status), a well a surrogate outcome (i.e., fusion a determined by radiography).For safety, meta-analysis should include all harm described in the Request for Proposal.

Let u know: Side navigation Policies & Procedures Data Partners Johnson & Johnson Medtronic Conferences website designed by The YODA Project Menu About Policies & Procedures Data Partners Johnson & Johnson Medtronic Conferences Request Request Data Metrics Data Requests Inquiries and CSR Summaries Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Data Availability I am seeking summary-level data for a specific trial or trial can I request that the Data Partner conduct the analyses? The YODA Project is facilitating external investigator access to clinical trial data being made available by it Data Partners. This access allows external investigator to conduct their own independent analysis of the data. Requests for Data Partners to conduct analysis are generally out-of-scope due to resource limitations, but will be considered on a case-by-case basis depending upon circumstance and rationale. Are all the available data listed on the YODA Project website? All of the trial listed on the website are available for sharing with external investigator following approval of a research request. Data from additional trial may also be available for sharing; however, trial not listed on the website have not yet been reviewed to determine if there might be issue which would slow or prevent sharing with external investigators. If there is a particular trial of interest that is not listed on the Trials page,. If it is possible to share the requested data externally, then the data will be made available upon review and approval of a full data request, and once the appropriate de-identification process is completed. If the data cannot be released, then the reason why they are not available will be provided to the requestor. Refer to the YODA (Section 4) for further information. What is the difference between a CSR Summary and a full CSR? A full Clinical Study Report (CSR) is a comprehensive overview of a clinical trial that, in general, number between 50 and 500 page and provides information on the background and rationale for the trial, a complete description of the study sample, design, intervention and main outcome measures, a well a a thorough provision of the result of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoint and safety. A CSR Summary is a brief overview that, in general, number between 5 and 20 page and summarizes the study plan and results, including a numerical summary of efficacy and safety results, study objective, criterion for inclusion, methodology, etc. Are Users required to pay a fee for accessing data through the YODA Project? No. All data are provided free of charge. What if my proposed research is already being conducted by one of the YODA Project Data Partners? The YODA Project will notify requestors if their proposed research is already being conducted by a Data Partner. The decision a to whether or not to proceed is solely that of the requestor. What if a similar Research Proposal ha already been submitted to the YODA Project by another requestor? Requestors are encouraged to reviewto determine if similar research project are already under way. The decision to proceed is solely that of the requestor, but is encouraged by the YODA Project given the need for reproducible science. The product I am interested in is under litigation- can I still submit a request for data? You may request any clinical trial data from partnering Data Partners, regardless of litigation status. However, it may be that certain data cannot be shared for various reasons, including reason related to litigation. This decision will need to be made on a case-by-case basis. The YODA Project will notify the requestor of the reason a data set is not approved for sharing. Do the Informed Consents signed by patient participating in clinical study from which data are requested allow for sharing of data with external researchers? Patients, investigators, and site who agree to participate in clinical trial are critical partner in advancing medical knowledge. Sharing of data for the advancement of science and medicine is an important goal and permit patient who participate in trial to help other patients. Data Partners are committed to ensuring patient privacy is maintained when data from clinical trial are shared and to making certain that the spirit of informed consent signed by patient is honored and that data are shared for research that will advance public health in a way which will protect patient confidentiality. This may limit the ability to share data in some instance (refer to the [Section 1] for further information). Upon approval of a data request, researcher will be granted access to participant-level study data that are devoid of personally identifiable information; current best guideline for de-identification of data will be used. What supporting documentation are available for each trial? The specific supporting documentation available depends on the trial and may include any or all of the following: collected datasets, annotated CRFs, data definition specifications, protocol with amendments, analysis datasets, statistical analysis plans, and/or full clinical study reports. Each individuallists the supporting documentation for that trial. Data Request Process What is the process for submitting a data request to the YODA Project? Researchers will need to review the , identify trial of interest, and login to create a new data request. Additional detail are specified in the. I am an employee of a Data Partner sharing data through the YODA Project- do I follow this data request process? No, this process is for researcher who are not affiliated with/employed by a Data Partner that is collaborating with the YODA Project, nor one of their partner company or contracted vendors. For all Data Partner affiliates, please utilize your established internal process for gaining access to data set for further research purposes. I am affiliated with Yale University- do I follow this data request process? Yes, all interested investigator that are external to the Data Partner, including those based at Yale University (the site of the YODA Project), must follow the YODA Project data request process. Is there an example of a Research Proposal that I can use a a template? Yes, a with instruction is available. Investigators can also reviewas examples. Is a SCOPUS ID required to apply for the data? No, a SCOPUS ID is not required. However, please provide your SCOPUS ID if you have one a this will allow tracking of submitted data request using an established unique identifier. AScopus ID# is the unique author identifier from Elseviers Scopus database, an abstract and citation database of the peer-reviewed biomedical literature. Any individual who ha published an article or indexed conference abstract will have automatically been assigned an ID # by Elsevier. Does every team member need to complete a Conflict of Interest statement? Yes, a Conflict of Interest statement is required for the Principal Investigator and all Key Personnel. Key Personnel are those who will have access to the data or who will analyze and/or report on finding from use of the data. Does every team member need to complete the Data Use Agreement Training? The Principal Investigator and any Key Personnel who will have data access need to complete the training. Does the Data Use Agreement Training need to be completed for every data request? No, the Principal Investigator and Key Personnel only need to complete the training for their first data request (unless otherwise determined by the YODA Project). Will I be notified when my data request ha been received? Yes, a notification will be sent to the email address provided during account creation upon data request receipt. A second notification will be sent stating whether additional material are required or your data request is undergoing review. I am a Research Assistant on my project- can I complete the data request on behalf of the PI? Any team member besides the Principal Investigator can complete the data request. Once the team member creates an account using one of the third party log in options, the Principal Investigators information should be entered under Project Personnel. The email address of the person who should receive communication from the YODA Project should be entered in the Email field. Data Request Review Process What criterion will be used to review, and who will make the decision on whether or not my Research Proposal will be approved? The YODA Project will evaluate Research Proposals to ensure that the proposal ha scientific merit, in that 1) the scientific purpose is clearly described; 2) the data requested will be used to create or materially enhance generalizable scientific and/or medical knowledge to inform science and public health; and 3) the proposed research can be reasonably addressed using the requested data. If the YODA Project is unable to verify the scientific merit of the proposal, two independent peer review will be solicited by investigator with sufficient clinical expertise in the broader scientific community who are unaffiliated with the Data Partner or the YODA Project. Upon return of the independent, external reviews, the YODA Project will meet with at least one member of the YODA Project Steering Committee, who will also have independently reviewed all materials, in order to make a final decision to grant or deny data access. Refer to the(Section 3) for further information. I have a question regarding a data request I submitted/plan to submit to the YODA Project- who should I contact? Questions regarding data request can be sent to. I submitted a Research Proposal to the YODA Project and it wa approved. If I write additional proposals, do they need to be approved by the YODA Project a well? Yes, each individual Research Proposal need to be submitted to the YODA Project, regardless of whether previous proposal were approved. Data Use Agreement What if my institution ha question about or change to the DUA? The DUA ha been prepared after considerable deliberation and negotiation between Yale University and the Data Partner, in order to best facilitate access to these data for external investigators. Please note that change can only be made in exceptional circumstances, when required by Federal or State law. Any requested change will need to be identified using Track Changes and reviewed by the Yale University Office of Sponsored Projects (OSP), a well a the Data Partner. Please contactwith any questions. Can I use an electronic signature for the Data Use Agreement (DUA)? No, the DUA need to be printed, signed, and then emailed to the YODA Project () once notification is received from the YODA Project that your Research Proposal wa approved. How long is my DUA valid? There is an expiration date of one year after signing the DUA, which can be renewed additional time for one-year period if a project is ongoing. Upon project completion, investigator will destroy all copy of the data (if applicable) and supporting documentation. Investigators shall provide certification evidencing such destruction within 30 day of the expiration date. If an investigator publication is accepted, right to use the data are retained for verification of the publication and to respond to inquiry regarding the publication for five (5) year from acceptance. The data cannot be used for additional analysis. Any additional analysis will require a new application for data access to the YODA Project. Data Access How long will it take to access the requested data once a data request ha been approved? The time required to make data available is dependent on several factors, including how many request are received at a given time, the number of trial requested, whether External Review is required to evaluate the scientific merit of the proposal, whether the data requested are in an electronic format that ha been de-identified and is ready for sharing with external investigators, and the time required to appropriately de-identify the data. After any clarifying information is received from the requestor, the aim is to make a decision regarding approval within 30 days, and, once the investigator ha returned the signed DUA, to provide access to the data within an additional 30 days. How will I access the data? The method by which data will be made available will depend on the Data Partner. One possible method will involve data being made available to approved requestors via a password-protected personalized account on a secure (Safe Harbor) data sharing platform. For those Data Partners preferring this method, access will be granted to a maximum of three researcher per approved data request. All relevant clinical trial data and supporting documentation will be made available via this platform. Data will remain on the secure Safe Harbor platform and will not be downloadable or copied. However, relevant associated materials, such a clinical study report and protocols, will be downloadable from the secure Safe Harbor platform. In addition, request granted solely for redacted complete CSRs will be distributed directly, without access through the secure Safe Harbor platform. Another possible method for providing data access to approved requestors involves transfer of data directly to the requestor via a secure electronic data transfer system (after the DUA ha been signed by all parties). Depending on the system, these data may need to be downloaded in order to be used. Data Use I received data through the secure data sharing platform. Can I download these data to my personal computer? No, data made available on the secure data sharing platform will not be able to be downloaded or copied. All work on the data must take place within the secure platform. Will I be able to download the supporting documentation for analysis of participant-level data (e.g., case report forms, protocols, CSRs)? Yes. While participant-level data will remain on the secure platform and will not be able to be downloaded or copied, relevant associated materials, such a clinical study report and protocols, will be downloadable from the secure platform. All supporting documentation will need to be destroyed upon DUA expiration. What if I want to use different analytical tool to perform my analyses, in addition to Stata? Researchers will have access to Stata, R, RStudio, Notepad, and OpenOffice. If needed, researcher will be able to upload additional data set to the secure platform. Researchers may also request that additional analytical package be made available on the secure data sharing platform and the YODA Project will work with the Data Partner to determine whether this is possible. The YODA Project will work with researcher to ensure that project can be conducted within the platform. How do I report a possible safety concern found during data analysis? Any possible safety concern that arises from data analysis should be reported directly to the Data Partner immediately for further evaluation and reporting to appropriate Health or Regulatory Authorities a necessary. Appropriate contact information is provided in the DUAs. May I use these data in a course I am teaching on data analysis? No, data cannot be accessed or shared with third party that are not listed on your data request. This precludes providing data to student a part of teaching and education efforts. Does the YODA Project provide any technical or statistical support? The YODA Project doe not provide any technical or statistical support. For analytical support, the YODA Project can facilitate contact between Data Users and Data Partners, if consultation is desired on the part of the Data User and sufficient resource are available on the part of the Data Partner. Transparency Will the Data Partner know the identity of requestors? The data request review process will be blinded to both YODA Project reviewer and Data Partners. Not until data access is granted will the YODA Project post the requestors identity, the Research Proposal, a summary of the Data Partner Due Diligence Assessment, any scientific review from external investigator or the YODA Project Steering Committee, and the YODA Projects decision to grant or deny data access. What is the relationship between the YODA Project and Data Partners? The YODA Project is an independent, academic organization partnering with Data Partners, removing the perception of influence over access. The YODA Project review request and associated registration material to ensure that all required information is completely submitted, and is committed to facilitating external access to these data for scientific purposes. Data Partners have given the YODA Project full jurisdiction to make decision regarding data access. Will the YODA Project post my Research Proposal publicly? Yes, every proposal will be posted on the YODA Project website, regardless of approval status, along with the Principal Investigators name, a summary of the Data Partner Due Diligence Assessment, any scientific review from external investigator or the YODA Project Steering Committee, and the YODA Projects decision to grant or deny data access. An overview ofis available, and the list ofis made publicly available. Research result and/or publication will also be posted on the YODA Project website a soon a they are available.
