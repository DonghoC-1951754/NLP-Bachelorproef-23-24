Contact Details Santiago Charramendieta Website Increased visibility of order delivery process VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira CHALLENGE: The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and it supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication method have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchange between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT system of both companies, the management of product order can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors. SUCCESS: The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and it supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case.

Contact Details Santiago Charramendieta Website Increased visibility of order delivery process VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira CHALLENGE: The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and it supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication method have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchange between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT system of both companies, the management of product order can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors. SUCCESS: The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and it supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors.

The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case.

Contact Details Santiago Charramendieta Website Increased visibility of order delivery process VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira CHALLENGE: The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and it supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication method have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchange between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT system of both companies, the management of product order can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors. SUCCESS: The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and it supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case.

What is data sovereignty? Today, organization of all type and size collect and store huge amount of every kind of data. IDSA enables you to self-determine how and when others may use it across the value chain. We call this data sovereignty. Why doe this matter? Control over data Data sovereignty ensures that organizations, governments, and individual have control over their data. This control allows them to self-determine how their data is collected, stored, shared, and used by others. Data sovereignty is a spectrum; it about finding the right balance between keeping data safe and sharing it to gain added value. Innovation and trust In a data-driven economy, trust is essential for fostering innovation and encouraging participation in data-sharing ecosystems. By establishing data sovereignty and enforcing rule for data management, such a data usage policy and contracts, organization can create an environment of trust and reliability. When participant feel confident that their data is handled securely and self-determined, they are more likely to engage in collaborative initiatives, leading to innovation, knowledge sharing, and economic growth. Interoperability and collaboration Data sovereignty promotes interoperability among participant in data spaces. By adhering to common technical standards, organization can share data seamlessly and collaborate effectively across different platform and domains. The growing number of industrial cloud platform and the heterogeneity of the platform landscape underscore the need for data sovereignty standard to ensure secure and trusted data exchange between different platforms.

LEARN MORE: International Standards Worldwide access, European principle Our vision for shaping the future data economy requires international standard for data spaces. Such standard are crucial for enabling sovereign and trustworthy data sharing, a demanded by European stakeholders, and are essential for ensuring interoperability across the global landscape. Standardization the key to interoperability Standardization is crucial for global exchange because it enables interoperability, reduces technical barriers, and enhances trade. It help business reduce costs, enter global markets, and ensure quality product for consumers. It facilitates innovation, minimizes R&D risks, and support environmental protection. Additionally, it allows company to influence regulation and stay competitive by adapting to market trends. Given the established position of IDS a de facto standards, it is vital to improve go-to-market strategy and increase maturity by aligning IDSA asset with relevant standardization bodies. This effort is at the forefront of everything we do at IDSA. Our members, the IDSA working group and the standardization coordination group, a well a the IDSA technical team, work diligently with key body at ISO, CEN/CENELEC and W3C and advise the European Commission on advancing global standard for data spaces. IDSA engagement in European and International Standardization body How it all come together Our standardization effort are fueled by the IDSA member and technical staff commitment, who actively participate in standard committee to shape and lead the development of data spaces. Central to these effort are the IDS Reference Architecture Model, the IDSA Rulebook, and the Dataspace Protocol, which are key in setting technical specification and fostering interoperability. Eclipse Foundation new working group on data space In collaboration with the Eclipse Foundation, weve launched the Eclipse Dataspace Working Group (EDWG) to spearhead the creation of open-source software, component and specification for data spaces. This partnership accelerates the development of the Dataspace Protocol (DSP), aiming to establish it a an ISO Standard and enhance global data sharing and sovereignty. The EDWG aligns technical effort with universal standards, leveraging global developer network to ensure interoperability and trust in data spaces. ISO, IEEE, CEN/CENELEC international & European standardization activity On the international front, initiative like IEEE P3800 and various ISO JTC1 activity underscore the growing importance of data space in global standardization, requiring collaboration across sectors. In Europe, the focus is on aligning with regulation such a the Digital Markets Act and the Data Governance Act, with collaborative effort in CEN/CENELEC addressing the region specific need through initiative like the Data, Dataspaces, Cloud and Edge Focus Group, aiming to harmonize standard across the digital economy. European Commission regulation state of the art The European Commission (EC), through the Multi-Stakeholder Platform on ICT Standardization and the Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC), work to align EU policy priority with standardization efforts.

Contact Details Santiago Charramendieta Website Increased visibility of order delivery process VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira CHALLENGE: The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and it supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication method have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchange between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT system of both companies, the management of product order can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors. SUCCESS: The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and it supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case.

The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case.

Contact Details Santiago Charramendieta Website Increased visibility of order delivery process VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira CHALLENGE: The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and it supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication method have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchange between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT system of both companies, the management of product order can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors. SUCCESS: The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and it supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case.

Contact Details Santiago Charramendieta Website Increased visibility of order delivery process VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira CHALLENGE: The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and it supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication method have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchange between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT system of both companies, the management of product order can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors. SUCCESS: The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and it supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case. LEARN MORE: Liaisons Connecting the dot Major digital initiative around the world are working with IDSA to connect IDS concept and standard with broad-based national and industry digital strategies, business need and specific applications. What our liaison do Industries need to agree on function and interface for platforms, reference architecture and interaction protocol that have the potential to create market and opportunity for the data economy of the future. This is not only true for the manufacturing sector but also for agriculture, healthcare, energy, public administration, municipality and much more.

To build the IDS Reference Architecture Model, company collaborated with scientists, technologist and policymakers. The result is a conceptual framework for designing and implementing IDS-compliant data spaces.It defines the key components, their interactions, and the principle that govern the architecture of an IDS data space. Role model Role model: IDS-RAM serf a a practical blueprint, but also a an exemplar of the ethical and design principle that well ensure trustworthiness in data exchange and true data sovereignty in the data economy of the future. Data sovereignty Data sovereignty: in the open, federated data marketplace we envision, the IDS-RAM enables self-determination and control over data usage to remain in the hand of those who collect, store and provide it, rather than passing to large data exchange platform and others, a is often the case today. Information model The IDS-RAMs information model is open, agnostic with regard to technology and domains. This approach enables data exchange within a trusted ecosystem while preserving data sovereignty. The information model enables the comprehensive description of data asset and interoperability required for this kind of exchange. Usage policy enforcement The IDS-RAM provides a framework for technically enforced agreement for data sharing in addition to existing, legally binding contracts. This serf to underwrite trust in the system. The working version of the IDS-RAM 4.0 is available on GitHub.

By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT system of both companies, the management of product order can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors. SUCCESS: The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and it supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case. LEARN MORE: Dataspace Protocol overview Advancing interoperability:the Dataspace Protocol The Dataspace Protocol is at the very core of the technical implementation of every data space component and guarantee interoperability between component and data space participants. What is the Dataspace Protocol Are you familiar with the Internet Protocol? At some point, everyone agreed on the HTTP standard to transport data between a web server and a browser. Now, picture a similar need for data spacesa universal protocol that doesnt favor specific business model or technical components. Enter the . This detailed set of rule is designed to facilitate seamless data sharing between data space component and participants. The Dataspace Protocol ensures trust and interoperability, defining the needed schema and protocol for cataloging data, negotiating contract and usage agreement within a data space. Organizations using this protocol can align with industry standards, foster best practices, and unlock new data-driven business model and opportunities. is version () of the Dataspace Protocol specification is the release candidate and considered to be stable. Further change shall not affect conformity. Since the specification is stable with change in details. The user-friendly version of the Dataspace Protocol is accessible in the IDSA Knowledge Base. For the version history and changes, refer to the GitHub Repository. Relation to the IDS-RAM The provides guidance on implementing functional requirement and design choice for component within a data space, guaranteeing essential data sovereignty for reliable data exchange. The Dataspace Protocol effectively put into practice the principle and guideline outlined in the IDS-RAM. It set forth technical specification and mechanism for standardized , ensuring consistent interaction among components. This promotes interoperability and maintains data sovereignty within data spaces. Relation to the IDSA Rulebook In the , IDSA describes at an organizational level the interaction of role and component in a data space, which create the foundation for trust and core function of a data space. It clarifies the business level structure and process of a data space. The Dataspace Protocol provides the to implement the compliance, trust, and security measure dictated by the IDSA Rulebook, ensuring that data transaction adhere to the standard and policy detailed in IDSA Rulebook. Relation to standardization The Dataspace Protocol provides a standardized set of rule and format for data exchange. This is necessary for interoperability, allowing different system and organization to communicate in a seamless way. As part of IDSAs goal to establish the Dataspace Protocol a an ISO standard, plan are underway to integrate the specification document IDSA ha created for the Dataspace Protocol with a compatibility kit an essential software component, crafted by the developer community. This integration is set to take place within the . Why we need the Dataspace Protocol When organization or company want to share data, they need to provide detail about the data to enable it transfer. The Dataspace Protocol explains how this information is provided: It outline how are presented a and how rule about data usage are expressed. It defines how governing data usage are written and negotiated electronically. It explains how datasets are accessed using specific protocols. The interaction within a data space involve , which implement the described protocols. While most interaction occur between data connectors, some involve other systems.

LEARN MORE: Certification Certification: the basis of trust How can you gain from your valuable data? by sharing it with others in trustworthy partnerships. These partnership are based on data spaces. It is therefore our goal to establish data space that guarantee a safe collaboration between partners. Entrusting data to IDS The foundation of IDS is trust, which is established through a rigorous, transparent certification process. The most important component of a data space is the IDS Connector. To make sure that each IDS Connector behaves a it should, it is certified against specific security standard and so is any participant in data sharing. On this basis of trust the participant can start their actual exchange of data. Transparency through clear process For the certification of participant and components, we are using a certification scheme which defines the rules, and standard of the certification process. The IDS certification scheme follows best practice from internationally accredited certification concepts. a Two complementary type of certification IDS certification ha two parts: First, you prove that the IDS component you are using is built correctly. Second, you need to make sure your IDS component operational environment is supporting data sharing according to the requirement and rules. While the certification of your operational environment focus on security and trust, the component certification also ensures interoperability. Core component certification Here we evaluate and certify the core component of IDS. Do they provide the required functionality and security? a Operational environment certification This evaluation provides an assessment of the trustworthiness of the physical environment, defined processes, and organizational rules. a There are two assurance level available Different company and organization have different data sharing needs, timelines, and budgets. For that reason, we offer two type of assessment to allow for more flexibility. Have a look at the first and simpler one below to the left and see a more complex variant below to the right. a The assurance level 1 checklist approach cover basic requirement for taking part in IDS. It allows you to prove that your IDS Connector is not only interoperable with any other connector in a data space but also complies with the IDS Reference Architecture Model. It is prepared by yourself and focus on basic implementation but also on efficient, non-bureaucratic processes. Before starting the assessment, your component need to go through the IDS reference testbed The assessment is based on a questionnaire, which can be accessed via the IDS Certification portal Youll receive your certificate after youve filled in the questionnaire, uploaded the testing log file to the portal and have been assessed based on that information The checklist approach certification generates significant value for companies; it is the beginning of a journey towards trustworthy and interoperable data space to grow your business. All IDS component must meet a list of certification criterion to prove the provision of the required functionality, interoperability, and level of security. a The IDS assurance level 2 concept review certification is a wonderful way to show your partner in data sharing that you are committed to giving them the highest level of trust. It is proof that your IDS component complies with all requirement in term of functionality and security. The concept review certification is performed by an independent third party: the IDS evaluation facilities. All IDS evaluation facility must go through an extensive approval process for added security. The external concept review includes the examination of documentation a well a the practical testing of the Connector, to ensure the correct implementation of the functional and security requirements. IDS Assurance Level 2 strike the right balance between an independent review and the corresponding costs. This level can be combined with all three trust levels. Receiving the third-party IDS certificatedemonstrates: comprehensive review and testing independent validation credibility by data sharing partner All IDS component must meet a list of certification criterion to prove the provision of the required functionality, interoperability, and level of security. a Operational environment certification This evaluation provides an assessment of the trustworthiness of the physical environment, processes, and organizational rules. a The self-assessment cover basic requirement for taking part in IDS. This allows smaller company to clear the first hurdle to IDS Certification and try out data space participation. It is prepared by yourself and focus on basic but also on efficient, non-bureaucratic process The assessment itself is based on a questionnaire, which can be accessed via the IDS Certification portal. Youll receive your certificate after youve filled in the questionnaire and have been assessed based on that information The IDS Self-assessment Certification generates significant value for companies; it is the beginning of a journey towards trustworthy and interoperable data space to grow your business. All IDS component must meet a list of certification criterion to prove the provision of the required functionality, interoperability, and level of security. a Certified data connector Which data connector are certified?

T-Systems Data Intelligence Hub (DIH) connector VTT DSIL connector IDS evaluation facility IDSA implementation should be reliable and robust. To this end, data sharing between certified entity using certified core component is encouraged. IDS evaluation facility are accredited laboratory for validating IDS component according to standard formulated by IDSA. The evaluation facility independently oversee the validation of commercial IDS component developed by company in various industries. They are also responsible for preparing the corresponding evaluation report, which is sent to IDSA for subsequent certification. SQS | Software Quality Service SQS is the first approved IDS Evaluation Facility and the accredited laboratory for validating component according to the IDSA standard for rusted and sovereign data sharing. Details: Low barrier to certification IDS Certification is compatible with commonly used security standard likeISO 27001 and IEC 62443.

Comparably, each IDS component is expected to behave in adherence with IDS specification and to protect the data which is transferred and processed. It shall allow participant to ass the possible consequence of data sharing and provide transparent information. Therefore, component need to pas the Component Certification before they may be used in the IDS. While the certification of organization and individual focus on security and trust, the certification of component additionally refers to compliance with technical requirement ensuring interoperability.To ensure a consistent process in the certification of participant and core components, the IDS us a certification scheme comprising all processes, rules, and standard governing the certification process. The IDS Certification Scheme follows best practice from internationally recognized certification concepts. IDS Certification is described in the IDS Reference Architecture Model (IDS-RAM), a practitioner-oriented guide to designing and implementing architecture for data spaces. Roles in IDS Certification The realization of the IDS certification scheme requires different role responsible for different tasks: applicants, evaluation facilities, and certification body Certification body The certification body oversees the certification process regarding quality assurance and framework governance. It defines standard evaluation procedure and supervises the action of the evaluation facilities. A certificate is granted only if both, the evaluation facility, and the certification body have concluded that all precondition for certification are fulfilled. Evaluation facility Contracted by an applicant, the evaluation facility is responsible for carrying out the detailed technical and/or organizational evaluation work during a certification process. The evaluation facility issue an evaluation report for the respective organization/individual or core component, listing detail regarding the evaluation process and an assessment whether all requirement are properly fulfilled. The approval scheme for evaluation facility can be found . Applicant The applicant is not just the subject of the evaluation and certification process but play an active part in it. An applicant need to actively apply to trigger the certification process. During the certification process, the Applicant provides all necessary material needed for the evaluation and certification of it component or organization and support with question or issue arising. Certification process The certification follows the same process for all certification profile in operational environment and component certification. It consists of the following three phases: Application Phase: The main goal of this stage is the successful start of the IDS evaluation and certification process. Evaluation Phase: The main goal of this stage is the evaluation of an applicant or core component based on the defined evaluation criteria. Certification Phase: The main goal of this stage is the examination of the evaluation report by the certification body, which issue a certificate if the result of the evaluation process is positive. However, the detail for each phase differ slightly between the assurance level a described below. Assurance Level 1 For Assurance Level 1, the applicant must apply directly to the certification body to trigger the start of the certification process. Once the certification body accepts the application, the applicant is responsible for the evaluation phase by conducting a self-assessment and providing the result to the certification body. In the certification phase, the certification body review the self-assessment and issue the certificate, if the self-assessment meet the defined requirements. Fig.: Certification Process for Assurance Level 1 Assurance Level 2 and 3 Assurance Level 2 and 3 require an independent evaluation facility to conduct the evaluation of the component or operational environment. The applicant must contract an evaluation facility. Together, applicant and evaluation facility finalize the application for certification with the certification body. Afterwards, the evaluation facility is responsible for carrying out the evaluation according to the IDS certification scheme. The evaluation facility document their progress and finding in an evaluation report which is passed on to the certification body at the end of the evaluation phase. In the certification phase, the certification body examines the evaluation report and issue a certificate, if the evaluation wa conducted properly and led to a positive evaluation result. IDS Certification criterion IDS Certification ensures that IDS component and organization or individual who want to participate in data sharing meet the highest security standards. These standard are industry-proven security criterion derived from ISO/IEC 27001 (international standard for information security management) and IEC 62443 (cybersecurity for operational technology in automation and control systems). In addition, IDS Certification implement security criterion defined in the Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue(C5) and the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix. Finally, IDS certification capture IDS specific criteria. The certification criterion are defined in the IDS Certification criterion catalogs. IDS Certification trust level IDS Certification ensures that IDS component and organization or individual who want to participate in data sharing provide a sufficiently high degree of trust and security. Nevertheless, the IDS Certification ha a flexible setup and provides different level of certification according to the intended use cases. To ensure on the one hand a low entry barrier specifically suitable for SMEs and on the other hand a scalable certification to meet high information security requirements, three different security levels, with an increasing extent of the security requirement that need to be fulfilled, were defined: Criteria for IDS Connector certification Three different trust levels, with an increasing extent of the security requirement that need to be fulfilled, are defined: Trust 1: offer basic security feature to protect against attacker from outside, to ensure integrity and availability. It is therefore designed for use in scenario with only low security requirements. A Connector meeting this profile is suitable for exchanging data with limited trust and security needs, for exchange of data in a contained environment or for demonstration purposes. Trust 2: includes strict container isolation, integrity-protected logging, encryption of all persisted data, protection against accidental misuse by administrators. This profile is used for scenario in which the protection of the processed and transmitted data is essential. Trust 3: offer additional protection against misuse of privileged access, i.e., manipulation by administrators. This includes the protection against insider attack a well a against external attacker who could gain privileged access. This is achieved by actively monitoring user and data on behalf of the data owner. Criteria for IDS operational environment certification The operational environment certification defines three different trust levels, with an increasing extent of the security requirement that need to be fulfilled: Trust 1: cover only the basic security requirement that every participant of the International Data Space need to fulfil. The entry level therefore serf a a low barrier for company (especially SMEs) interested in trying out International Data Space participation. Trust 2: cover additional security requirements, ensuring an advanced level of security. This level is suit-able for most core participants. Trust 3: includes special security requirement that are necessary for International Data Space participant providing key service within the Inter-national Data Space.

All IDS component must meet a list of certification criterion to prove the provision of the required functionality, interoperability, and level of security. The evaluation of these certification criterion is conducted in the IDS core component certification. Component assurance levels: The depth and rigor of a component evaluation consists of the following three assurance levels, independent on the type of component that is being certified: Assurance Level 1: Checklist self-assessment and automated interoperability testing Assurance Level 2: External concept review including functional and security testing Assurance Level 3: External evaluation including concept review, testing and source code audit Connector trust level The criterion that make up each of the three trust level for a Connector are defined in such a way that they are specific enough to ensure interoperability with the functional requirement of an IDS Connector, yet general enough, to allow the use of a Connector in different deployment scenario without having to define different criterion catalogue for each separate use case. The following three trust level are defined for the certification of a Connector: Trust Level 1: Data space interoperability Trust Level 2: Feature complete for data usage control Trust Level 3: Additional protection from internal attack The following figure illustrates all possible combination of assurance and trust level, that an applicant can choose from. This matrix approach allows the component developer to select a combination of assurance and trust level for their component that best correspond with the intended use cases. On the one hand, this ensures a low entry barrier specifically suitable for SMEs. On the other hand, a scalable certification to meet high information security requirement becomes possible. purposes. Operational environment certification Participants in the International Data Spaces share valuable data. It is essential that all participant's organizational process and operational environment are trustworthy. This trustworthiness is evaluated in the IDS operational environment certification. Central element of the IDS operational environment certification are the different trust level and assurance levels. The IDS established these level to offer suitable certification profile for different use case requirements. On one side, the following three trust level are established: Trust level 1: Entry into data sharing Trust level 2: Providing reliable service Trust level 3: Offering trust-building service Higher Trust Level represent the increasing number of criterion which need to be fulfilled for a successful certification.

Contact Details Santiago Charramendieta Website Increased visibility of order delivery process VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira CHALLENGE: The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and it supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication method have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchange between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT system of both companies, the management of product order can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors. SUCCESS: The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and it supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case. LEARN MORE: IDS Reference Testbed Plug Test Go! The IDS concepts, architecture, and component form the standard for sovereign data sharing. To move from theory to practice and to achieve large-scale adoption, technical component must be tested for interoperability compliance. For this reason, we have created the IDS Reference Testbed. Make the grade! The IDS reference testbed is an open-source setup with IDS component that ha been jointly developed by the IDSA open-source community. The testbed will enable company and organization to develop IDS-compliant component and test them on their interoperability. It is also a preparatory tool for the IDS certification. Why is this important? The communal goal of the IDSA is to unleash the potential of the data economy through data sovereignty and trusted data sharing in data spaces. The testbed will enable the large-scale adoption of IDS component needed to bring this reality to fruition. What are the advantage of the testbed? Specifically, the testbed make it possible to experience your component behavior in an IDS infrastructure in real-time. As such, it is the perfect way to put your use-case to the test and prepare your component for IDS certification. Plug-test-go. Its a simple a that. The testbed is publicly available and contains the essential IDS infrastructure setup (CA, Daps, Meta Data Broker and connectors). Any company or organization that ha developed IDS component can employ them in the testbed to check their interoperability and compliance with the IDS Standard The IDS reference testbed: your first step towards the creation of data spaces.

BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case.

LEARN MORE: City Dataspace Wuppertal | Solingen | Remscheid | APTIV CHALLENGE: Smart city are becoming more and more of a reality every day. While the first autonomous vehicle are making their way into city on a trial basis, parking lot can already report whether they are occupied or free, sensor monitor air quality, and multimodal apps also enable people to get around using different mobility solutions. What all these application have in common is that they are based on data generated and managed in different place by different actors. However, application based on Open and Urban Data in particular have the disadvantage that they are either built specifically for exactly one city and then only work there or have to be adapted for other city at great expense. The reason for this is that today's Open & Urban Data portal provide data set in different formats, model and schemas. In addition to these syntactic differences, there are also semantic differences, such a different metric or geo-reference systems. This is exactly what make it costly for app developer to develop solution that work outside of a municipality. The City Dataspace focus on the challenge of increasing and enabling the usability of Smart City relevant Open and Urban data using the example of mobility and geodata across municipal boundaries. SUCCESS: The City Dataspace aim to enable the data-driven smart city of tomorrow by enabling compatibility of heterogeneous open and urban data from different municipality together with data from other stakeholder across city boundaries. For this purpose, the City Dataspace relies on the established semantic technologies, combined with new innovative concept to simplify the use of the required technologies. These concept are intended to make it possible to provide semantically annotated data in an interoperable way with little effort. This interoperability should enable app developer to develop an app once and roll it out to a large number of municipality using the City Dataspace. Conversely, the City Dataspace enables municipality to participate in existing apps just by making their data available. BENEFITS: The City Dataspace aim to enable the data-driven smart city of tomorrow by enabling compatibility of heterogeneous open and urban data from different municipality together with data from other stakeholder across city boundaries. COMPONENTS: The City Dataspace is a Knowledge Graph-based Data Management platform that allows access to batch and streaming data using different kind of data connectors.

Links: DataPorts ITI | Traxens | PRODEVELOP | IBM Israel | OTE | Everis | UPV | ICCS | UDE | CERTH | Fraunhofer ISST | THPPA | Valenciaport Foundation CHALLENGE: Although many projects/initiatives have dealt and/or are dealing with developing data platform architecture in diversified application domains, not many project have addressed integration in port environment with the possibility of including cognitive services/applications and extending/federating the platform to whole transportation route covering whole Europe. Lack of interoperable, scalable, reliable data platform cause major technological and business issue such a the impossibility to plug non-interoperable data source into heterogeneous data platforms, the impossibility to develop application to exploit heterogeneous data in homogeneous and/or cross domains, slowness of data technology introduction at a large-scale, discouragement in adopting data sharing technology, increase of costs, scarce reusability of data, user dissatisfaction, and lack of unified data governance mechanisms. SUCCESS: DataPorts aim to design, develop, set-up and operate a data platform for the trusted, secure and reliable data sharing with IDS connector and trading among the actor operating in the diverse supply chain involved in the seaports, also enabling the connection with other stakeholder in the logistics supply chain. BENEFITS The adoption and use of this Data Platform by existing connected / digital port will imply their transition to actual cognitive ports, taking real advantage of the huge amount of data produced by the stakeholder and opening the way to new capabilities: Real-time control of operations; Streamlined decision making; Accurate prediction of future event and situations; Prescriptive analytics. COMPONENTS In the context of the DataPorts project, an industrial data platform (cognitive port data platform) ha been designed and implemented that: 1. Connects to different digital infrastructure currently existing in digital seaports, enabling the interconnection of a wide variety of system into a tightly integrated ecosystem, 2. Sets the policy for a trusted and reliable data sharing and trading based on data owner rule and offering a clear value proposition, and 3. Leverages on the data collected to provide advanced data analytics service based on which the different actor in the port value chain cloud develop novel AI and cognitive applications. In the context of the DataPorts platform, to realize data sharing and data exchange, two main approach are considered: Data is stored off-chain: Generally, in this approach, we follow the concept of the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) reference architecture model. In a nutshell, we consider the P2P data exchange between the data owner and data consumer through the IDSA connectors. To ensure the security and privacy aspects, blockchain manages consent of access to data. Smart contract decide if a particular access to data is allowed concerning the invokers credential and the specification of access rule for the data. Data is stored on-chain (blockchain for shared data): Blockchain platform record transaction related to shared data and process of all participant in a business network. For instance, cold chain alarm of a container for verification of it state such a if condition have been compromised, allows everybody in the network to be aware of the event and act upon it. This approach in fact ensures verifiable and immutable information on shared data through the entire chain to all business network participants, serving a a single source of truth and providing transparency and a not-repudiation process. In the first approach, the data (sovereign data) is kept on the owner premises. The metadata for sovereign data is published to the broker (IDSA broker). A data consumer need to understand whether the data he seek is a shared data stored in Blockchain or is stored by a data owner. To clarify this, the data consumer must access the IDSA broker, and in case the data is sovereign data, data sharing rule are used to determine if a data access is allowed. Eventually, in case of a legitimate data access, a peer-to-peer secure communication with data owner to obtain data is initialized through IDSA connectors. LEARN MORE: H2 Metaverse ARENA-INNOVATION | CODE_n CHALLENGE: The latest draft of the "Act to Accelerate the Use of Liquefied Natural Gas (Gesetzes zur Beschleunigung de Einsatzes verflssigten Erdgases) see a significant change in reallocation of LNG import terminal for the import of hydrogen. In the draft, it is no longer mandatory that green hydrogen or it derivative must replace the fossil fuel LNG. Now there is talk of "climate-neutral hydrogen and derivatives". This mean that hydrogen based on natural gas, of which CO2 is fully captured and not released into the atmosphere can also be used. With blue hydrogen, the CO2 would be stored underground (CCS). In the case of turquoise hydrogen, it would be done using the at large-scale not yet tested methane pyrolysis converted into solid matter. In both case it would have to be ensured that during extraction and transport of the natural gas no methane escapes. In theory, even hydrogen fall into this category, that would be produced by electrolysis using nuclear power. SUCCESS: A project draft (Projektskizze) ha already been submitted to BMBF under the acronym "h2republic". The goal is that a new "H2 Data Space" for sovereign data exchange shall be created, which shall stand at the basis of the "H2 Metaverse" platform. Due to the technical complexity of the "H2 Data Space", it should remain hidden to the eye of the conventional "H2 Metaverse" platform user. Hence, the "H2 Data Space" shall be the interface to the programmer and smart service providers, whereas the "H2 Metaverse" shall be the interface to the conventional Fuel Cells and Hydrogen (FCH) player by using predefined smart service according to their requirements. Such smart federated service can/shall be the implementation of standardized Digital Twins for ensuring cross-sectoral interoperability along the entire value chain and for depicting the entire physical hydrogen world into the digital H2 Metaverse, which at the end should become a de-facto standard for the entire gas domain. BENEFITS Fuel Cells and Hydrogen (FCH) technology are defined a sector coupling technology for coupling the energy and mobility sector together. Hence, it is obvious, that the newly created "H2 Data Space" will link up the already existing energy and mobility data space and of course other a well. On the other hand, in order to ensure sovereign data exchange and interoperability, it will try to digitally interconnect all FCH cluster worldwide. In order to prevent lock-in effects, the H2 Metaverse shall not belong to one person or entity but to the whole user and be created by them while being at the same time free of charge. With regard to the business model, this shall be realized via company participation (Gesellschaftsbeteiligung) with all the 16 German state (Bundeslnder), similar to the already existing company participation of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg to the "mobility data space". COMPONENTS: The H2 Metaverse platform shall be similar to the Catena-X platform in term of visibility. For this all the necessary IDS components, like for example the IDS/Eclipse Connector and so on shall be used.

COMPONENTS: IDS Connectors IDS Broker LEARN MORE: AluTrace Fraunhofer EMI | Fraunhofer IWM | fem CHALLENGE: Due to the great freedom of design, additive manufacturing (AM) offer enormous potential for lightweight construction. In order to harness this potential, it is crucial to integrate knowledge between the individual stage of the AM value chain. By digitally linking AM process and product data, lightweight design and production can be further optimized in economic and ecological terms. The present use case demonstrates the added value for the lightweight potential of additively manufactured (laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)) aluminum component when decentralized material and AM process data is shared between actor via a cross-institutional data space. In the present use case, a design engineer aim to optimize a component, originally manufactured by casting AlSi10Mg, with regard to lightweight design by mean of topology optimization for AM. A process-specific topology optimization algorithm (PSTO) will provide an optimized design and also knowledge of the best suited combination of AM-machine, part orientation in build space and a heat treatment. As input for this design algorithm, decentralized data about mechanical material characteristics, AM process parameter and post-processing information such a heat or surface treatment ha to be shared and linked in an automatic manner. Since the different data is provided by different actors, compliance with the FAIR data principle is paramount. SUCCESS: To meet this need, a data space architecture based on the International Data Spaces (IDS) reference architecture model is designed and implemented. By doing so, the very first instance of the Materials Data Space (MDS) is created.

These post-platforms are not interconnected amongst them and they do not hold any original data, just cache copies. Due to advanced security by design user have e-passports, issued by a developed public key infrastructure (PKI). With such e-passport, user can control their PODs, identify/authenticate themselves, get money from ATM, or open a hotel room. Users will not need logins/passwords anymore. Personal PODs keep data created by their owner, but also public and third-party data, for example, Cadastre, police or municipality data, other authorities, healthcare records, data from school and universities, etc. BENEFITS: The Web 3.0 Data Space concept make the physical world intensely data-rich and merges online and offline interaction into a single yet fully decentralized metaverse. Individual PODs keep all the information originated by a person via their online activities, including sent messages, posts, transactions, various file they created, etc. The same storage also keep track of all messages, comments, and reaction they or their content ever received. Organizations and public authority also record on the POD every piece of information about it owner's identity and legal liabilities, and this data cannot be changed or deleted by anyone but it authors. Every entity also store all the information related to it business and legal interaction on it POD. Just like individual ones, their PODs become unique focal point for their data. The Web 3.0 Data Space also implies that sooner or later, every real estate, vehicle, device, or even many part of them will have their own separate PODs. All information regarding their history (ownership, origin, modifications, adjustments, etc.), their future (resource left, maintenance scheduled), and their interaction with other subject and object will become available to their owners, manufacturers, regulators, partners, etc. COMPONENTS: Veracity Industry Data Platform IDS Connectors IDS Identity Provider (CA, DAPS, ParIS) IDS Metadata Broker LEARN MORE: Post-Platforms for Supply Chain Post-Platforms Sciences | Po Startinblox | Digita Digentity | SolidLab CHALLENGE: Full supply chain automation is not yet fully achievable due to data exchange and platform interconnectivity challenge - Vendor lock-in is another huge issue: user and company cannot switch between different digital service provider - Data silo created by numerous conflicting record in different database impact every player in the industry - Interactions with suppliers, logistics partners, and client require a lot of resource mainly because of the different IT solution each of them us - Data analysis and proper supply chain optimization require the widest access to quality and structured Big Data, which is currently not available SUCCESS: Dedicated PODs are assigned to each entity participating in the supply chain, including suppliers, contractors, and off-takers - Every piece of information is updated immediately, and there are absolutely no data conflict - No vendor lock-in, since user can seamlessly switch between platform - The usage of Linked Data facilitates real-time data analysis and work with different data format BENEFITS: Lower cost for all parties, due to optimized route and better timing Delays optimization thanks to instant access to thousand of alternative suppliers, itineraries, etc. Full transparency of the entire supply chain, since every data source, remains accessible Every piece of data ha a persistent ID Unlimited data analysis and supply chain optimization potential thanks to advanced semantic search LEARN MORE: Post-Platforms for Smart City Post-PlatformsSciences | PoStartinblox|DigitaDigentitySolidLab| City of Amsterdam | City of Rio de Janeiro CHALLENGE: Various actors, from public service like Police and City planning to private company in the transport, garbage processing, construction, and utilities, currently use hundred and thousand of databases, platforms, apps, and systems, creating probably the biggest data silo ever, with an incredible amount of outdated record and data conflicts.

Its even more challenging for large manufacturing company where the number of system may reach ~1000. Even from the end-user perspective, this situation is quite stressful and energy-consuming: human resource are used in a non-optimal way because of all the file exchange, related paperwork, unautomated communications; etc. But if we look at it holistically, well see large business performance considerably impacted by these dozen or even hundred of balkanized platform and system with their respective databases. Lack of interoperability is the most apparent issue. Still, there is another one behind it: data silos, multiple copy of similar data without a clear understanding of which version is the most recent. These data silo automatically imply that there is no control over data quality and that your technical team spend lot of effort to interconnect all these often almost incompatible system and to coordinate their incoherent ontologies. Last but not least, it negatively affect data transmission outside the company, including both communication with it client and all interaction with it supplier and contractors, which is especially crucial for the manufacturing sector. All these issue constantly keep too many human resource busy, consume too much energy, and result in the underperformance of the whole business. SUCCESS: Corporate data doesnt have to fit Procrustean bed of a multitude of different database with different ontology and data formats. Instead, it can be stored in a universal and fully machine-readable Linked Data format on separate secure virtual server we call them PODs for each object you interact with.

LEARN MORE: EdgeDS Intracom Telecom SUCCESS: This use case address the emerging need for secure, trustworthy, and sovereign data exchange among diverse stakeholder in edge computing ecosystems. This approach integrates mechanism for trustworthy and sovereign data exchange, into Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) environments, by extending the ETSI MEC Architectural Framework with IDS component and enriching Edge Computing application with data space capability in an as-a-service paradigm. BENEFITS: This work highlight the feasibility and usability of incorporating an IDS Connector-as-a-Service within the MEC Platform, towards creating a data ecosystem that enables trustworthy and sovereign data exchange and intercommunication of multiple domain and application that are hosted at the Edge. The proposed architecture provides the capability of utilizing and composing Dataspace-enabled MEC Applications, where any MEC App can act a a data service provider (potentially under some pricing scheme) towards other MEC Apps. This is not restricted to the supply of data but also extends to data process (e.g., ML models, data analytics workflows, etc.). Moreover, the MEC Platform itself can offer such value-added services, in addition to secure data exchange services, which translate to additional revenue stream for the Communication Service Provider - CSP (who is operating the MEC Platform). Last but not least, third-party data solution provider can offer (B2B2C) such data process to the CSPs to enrich their service on their MEC Platforms, without the need for third-party provider to run a MEC Apps, but rather by just providing the data processing models/software. To showcase the benefit of data-driven collaboration across system and actors, we employ a motivating example use case from the Autonomous Driving domain. We envision different scenario for autonomous, connected vehicle on a highway, which are powered with advanced safety, traffic routing, and other feature through the enactment of data service ecosystems. For instance, we consider the see-through case of a vehicle that intends to pas a truck and is temporarily provided access to a video stream of the car preceding that truck, which is equipped with a camera. Similar scenario are applicable, such a the platooning of vehicle that can drive in a coordinated manner a a group, sharing sensing information, or the exchange of safety or traffic alert between vehicle on the highway. COMPONENTS: This Use Case proposes the extension of the ETSI MEC architecture, by introducing the IDS- Connector-as-a-service, instilled directly into the MEC mechanisms. The prototype implementation of the proposed architecture includes the integration of the Dataspace Connector, implemented by Fraunhofer. In the introduced architecture, extending the MEC Architecture, each MEC Application (MEC App) can act a a data provider/consumer, in accordance with IDS role distinction. By introducing the concept of IDS Connector-as-a-Service among the functionality provided by the MEC Platform, each application is capable of obtaining it own connectorwhich exists within the MEC Platform a a MEC Platform-offered service instanceand can exchange data with any application that ha a registered connector inside or outside of the MEC host. In the scenario of two MEC Applications exchanging data, we denote MEC App1 the application that attempt to receive data, and a MEC App2 the one that provides the desired data. After the completion of the instantiation of both application and the assignment of a certified IDS connector to each of them, the connector information is available through the MEC Platforms relevant API for service discovery and availability. While data service that are not IDS enabled are registered directly on the MEC Platform, MEC App2 register the data resource it provides on it own connector. In order to consume the desired data services, MEC App1 receives the information of MEC App2s connector. Subsequently, MEC App1 performs a request to it own connector, encapsulating the information of the other connector, along with the identifier of the targeted resources. Finally, if the usage policy attached to the contract of the requested resource are accepted, then data transfer from the provider to the consumer is followed a defined by IDS.

Contact Details Santiago Charramendieta Website Increased visibility of order delivery process VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira CHALLENGE: The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and it supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication method have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchange between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT system of both companies, the management of product order can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors. SUCCESS: The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and it supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues.

LEARN MORE: April 5, 2024 Advancing global interoperability: The role of standardization in data space We've reached a critical moment in the journey of IDS, where standardization is no longer just a choice; it's a must-have. Just like USB, HTML, Wi-Fi, or electrical plug sockets, standard form the backbone of global interoperability and trade. This hold true for communication within and between data space a well. Silvia Castellvi International standard are indispensable in facilitating collaboration. They play a critical role in promoting interoperability, breaking down technical barriers, and fostering cross-border trade. Adhering to these common standard enables business to streamline their operations, tap into global markets, and provide top-notch product and service to consumers. Recognizing the importance of aligning with standardization body like ISO, CEN/CENELEC, IEEE and W3C, we are committed to advancing global standard for data sharing. Our drive for global standardization Our commitment is driven by the dedicated effort of IDSA member and technical staff who actively participate in standard committees. From observing to leading these committees, we build strategic partnership with key standardization bodies, advising the European Commission on advancing global standard for data spaces. Leveraging asset such a the IDS Reference Architecture Model (IDS RAM), the IDS Rulebook, and the Dataspace Protocol, we contribute to developing essential technical specification for implementing data spaces. European standardization initiative Within the European context, regulation like the Digital Markets Act (DMA), Data Governance Act (DGA), Data Act and AI Act emphasize the need for tailored standardization efforts. Collaborative research with CEN/CENELEC is important in addressing these specific standardization need and strengthening Europes digital economy. Initiatives like the CEN/CENELEC Focus Group on Data, Dataspaces, Cloud, and Edge and the proposed Technical Committee on Data Management, Data Spaces, Cloud, and Edge Computing are instrumental in shaping European standardization policies. Collaboration with the European Commission The IDSA collaborates closely with the European Commission to align standardization effort with EU policy priorities. The Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC) collaborates with the European Data Innovation Board to recommend guideline for unified European data spaces. By enhancing data interoperability and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations, these effort contribute significantly to the EUs digital transformation agenda. Our collective commitment to driving global standardization in data space pave the way for a more connected, efficient, and innovative future for business and society worldwide.

Contact Details Santiago Charramendieta Website Increased visibility of order delivery process VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira CHALLENGE: The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and it supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication method have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchange between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT system of both companies, the management of product order can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors. SUCCESS: The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and it supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case.

The existing communication method have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchange between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT system of both companies, the management of product order can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors. SUCCESS: The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and it supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructure of both company and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture. The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insight and valuable information from big data sets. BENEFITS: The established data space solution ha the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This give rise to several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such a change in demand or design modifications, allows supplier to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in time of disruptions, such a supply shortage or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help both party respond more effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both party to work together to find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve a the communication interface linking the two company and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rule and condition (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer. DAPS - enables connector to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issue OAuth2 access token for connectors, who need these token to access the service and data of other connectors. Metadata Broker store information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connector and can hence be considered a the search engine in this use case. LEARN MORE:
