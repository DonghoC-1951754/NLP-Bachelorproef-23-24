Project #155: The effect of Long COVID on Quality Adjusted Life Years using OpenPROMPTType: ResearchTopic areas: Topic area Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimate that a of 2nd January 2023, 2 million people in the UK were living with Long COVID. Within this cohort, 1.5 million people or 77% of those with Long COVID stated their symptom adversely affected their day-to-day activities, and 380,000 or 19% reporting their ability to undertake day-to-day activity had been limited a lot. Given the symptom are wide-ranging and diverse, the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) can be significant, however the impact on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) ha not yet been quantified.This study aim to ass the impact of Long COVID on QALYs, using EuroQoL EQ-5D questionnaire result from a smartphone app which is linked to patient registered with TPP general practice to provide GP and health records. Collection of this questionnaire data across 30-day interval will provide u with estimate of QALYs lost due to Long COVID. Results will evidence whether there are difference in quality-of-life impact from Long COVID across demographic group of age, ethnicities, geographic region, socioeconomic status and underlying health conditions.Converting these result into QALYs, standardised measurement used in the National Health Service (NHS), can ass the impact of Long COVID to help evaluate how much the effect of Long COVID cost the health service to prioritise future interventions.Study leads: ,Organisation: The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #154: Validation of ISARIC / SUS / PHOSP data for COVID-related hospital admissionsType: ResearchTopic areas: Topic area COVID transmission/prevalence/non-pharmaceutical prevention, Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death] and Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareHospital admission due to COVID-19 disease are recorded in multiple sources. This includes the hospital record themselves and specific audit of admission in participating hospital that collect more detailed information.Having multiple way of capturing the same information provides an opportunity to determine how accurate and reliable each source is, by comparing them with each other. For example, one source may have better capture of clinical characteristic like diabetes or heart disease, while another may offer more complete geographical coverage of relevant COVID-19 admissions.In this study we plan to explore the relative strength and weakness of each data source so that future researcher are better informed about how best to use them for research.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford Project #153: What wa the impact of COVID-19 on mortality related to venous thromboembolism in England?Type: Service Evaluation and AuditTopic areas: Topic area Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareBlood clot in the vessel of the leg and lung cause over 12000 death per year in the UK. A proportion of these are thought to be preventable. The number of death increased significantly following the emergence of COVID-19 with this infection known to increase the risk of the blood clots. This study would help u test the hypothesis that COVID-19 drove an increase in blood-clot related death and allow u to understand the characteristic of the individual that died in more detail. This may help u think about how we might prevent future death from blood clot and plan the allocation of national resource appropriately.Study lead: Organisation: NHS England Project #152: Digital access to primary care for older people during COVIDType: ResearchTopic areas: Topic area Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID] and Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareFor at least a decade, the World Health Organization and the NHS have been encouraging use of digital technology to improve health and care services. This ha expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, where lockdown and social restriction have been accompanied by rapid roll-out of digital technology to maintain access to health and care services. Government policy outline a digital first vision that prioritises the development of digital access to health and care services, e.g., by the NHS App a the front door to the NHS. However, there concern that older people are being disadvantaged and excluded with the increased use of digital technologies. The NIHR Older People and Frailty Policy Research Unit ha conducted two evidence review exploring the impact of digital technology on older people access to health and care. The first, conducted before the pandemic, found a lack of evidence that digital technology could support older people access to health and care. The second ha looked at what research ha been conducted on the digitalisation of health and care service since the start of the pandemic. Most research so far ha been small-scale and ha focused on telephone access. There is an urgent need for detailed analysis of the impact of pandemic-driven digitalisation of health and care service on older people. In particular, there is a need for a focus on potential health inequality among different group of older people (e.g., socioeconomic and ethnic groups). In this study, we propose to analyse electronic medical record in England to explore the impact on older people of digitalised GP access during the pandemic. We will analyse data from adult patient aged at least 18 who were registered with GPs between January 2019 to February 2022, with a specific interest in comparing consultation data for those aged under 65 and 65+.Study leads: ,,,,,Organisation: University of Manchester and Newcastle University Project #151: Venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular event in inflammatory rheumatic diseasesType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death] and Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcarePeople with inflammatory rheumatological diseases, such a rheumatoid arthritis, are at increased risk of blood clots, heart attack and stroke when compared to the general population. Inflammation contributes to the risk of these complications, but other factor can also play a role, including other medical condition and infections. In particular, we know that infection with COVID-19 increase the risk of blood clots, heart attack and strokes. What is not yet understood is whether these complication occur more or le frequently in people with inflammatory rheumatological disease who are prescribed specific medications.Our goal is to use routinely collected health data to describe rate of the following complication after COVID-19 infection in people with inflammatory rheumatological diseases: 1) blood clots; 2) heart attacks, stroke and other cardiovascular complications; and 3) overall mortality.We will compare the risk of these complication in individual who are prescribed different group of medication for their underlying condition (TNF inhibitors; JAK inhibitors; other biologic medications; non-biologic disease-modifying medications). We will account for other factor that might influence the chance of these complication occurring.This project will provide clinician with an evidence base on which to support clinical decisions. It will help determine which individual are at greatest risk of complications, and who may benefit from closer monitoring.Study lead: Organisation: King's College London Project #150: Evaluating the UK shielding policy during the COVID-19 pandemicType: ResearchTopic areas: COVID transmission/prevalence/non-pharmaceutical prevention and Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]A considerable proportion of the UK population suffers from long-term health conditions. During the COVID epidemic, a broad range of such condition (comorbidities) contributed to very severe outcome (hospitalisation and death) in people infected with the corona virus.The 2020 shielding policy aimed to protect people at greater risk by asking them to reduce sharply their contact with other people and thus reduce their risk of becoming infected. This public health policy ha not been evaluated and this study aim to do so using OpenSAFELY record on patient GP and hospital information on COVID and comorbidities.The study will implement a novel combination of OpenSAFELY record with a dynamic model of corona virus transmission in the population. This approach account for the fast change in the rate of infection that occurred a the epidemic spread; it also account for differing rate among locations, among age groups, and between people with or without comorbidities.Comparing the actual epidemic with a modelling scenario where the shielding policy would not have taken place, we hope to estimate how many severe outcome may have been averted by the shielding policy during 2020-21, and to so by age group in the population and NHS region in England.Study lead: Organisation: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #149: Descriptive cohort analysis of Long COVID and vaccination statusType: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]There are an estimated 2.1 million people in the UK with long COVID a of January 2023 according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In the absence of effective treatment for Long COVID, it is important to understand the possible effect of vaccination on reducing the burden of Long COVID.Previous research using OpenSAFELY ha found fewer record of Long COVID in primary care data when compared to the ONS estimate of the amount of Long COVID in the UK. Our study aim to provide a description of people with and without a record of Long COVID between 2020 and 2022, broken down by vaccination status of individuals. For those with a Long COVID diagnosis before vaccination were available, we will also describe the proportion vaccinated in this group.This descriptive study will provide a detailed description of those with and without a record of Long COVID in electronic health record to guide and motivate future observational research of the condition.Study lead: Organisation: London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Project #148: The impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy treatment pathway and outcomesType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareIn the UK there wa a delay in the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant mother due to safety concern of the vaccine and impact on the unborn child. It is now known that in the height of the pandemic 10% of pregnant woman who caught COVID-19 were admitted to hospital for critical care during their pregnancy and 18% of mum with COVID-19 during their pregnancy delivered early (2.5 time that of the background rate).A lot of non urgent healthcare service were reduced during the pandemic. Little is known about the impact of the pandemic on the care of mother that did not have COVID-19 infection and how the pandemic impacted their continuity of care.To date, most study have looked at summary statistic of secondary care provision (what happened in hospitals). The main objective for work is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the treatment pathway for mother during their pregnancy episode, the impact on pregnancy outcome and postnatal follow-up. This will look at how mother interacted with healthcare service and the consequence on maternal health postnatally.Study lead: Organisation: The University of Manchester Project #147: Winter pressure in primary care in the context of COVID-19 recoveryType: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThere is widespread concern about winter pressure on NHS services, particularly in the context of continued COVID recovery. People rely on primary care service for initial contact, diagnosis, treatment, and coordination of care. Where primary care is under pressure, it is likely that there will be a negative impact on patient care and the good functioning of the whole health service; for example, if someone cannot get an appointment with their GP, they might be more likely to present to A&E. If we can identify early warning sign that an organisation is under pressure, plan could be put in place earlier to minimise any negative effect on patients. We want to investigate whether we can use pattern in primary care data to measure pressure on service (e.g., if a practice is overwhelmed, it might carry out le routine/non-urgent tasks) and how those measure of pressure vary between different practice and over time. We also want to investigate whether patient experience worse outcome (e.g., presenting at A&E) if a practice doe look to be overwhelmed. Finally, we would like to develop and test algorithm that can identify service pressure early on and alert primary care staff so that they can respond accordingly.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford Project #146: Scarlet fever and invasive group A strep case during the COVID-19 pandemicType: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareDuring the pandemic there ha been a substantial change to the pattern of circulating virus and bacteria that cause illness [ref https://bjgp.org/content/72/714/e63, https://www.opensafely.org/approved-projects/#project-108, https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukhsa-update-on-scarlet-fever-and-invasive-group-a-strep-1]. In order to support ongoing response and recovery of NHS service from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is useful to have detailed information on pattern of disease being reported by the NHS and treatment such a antibiotics.In the winter of 22/23 UKHSA (December 8th) reported an unseasonal increase of scarlet fever and group A strep infections. Sadly, between 19th September 2022 and 1st January 2023 there have been 151 death across all age groups, including 29 child under 18 in England. UKHSA indicates that the increase is likely to reflect increased susceptibility to these infection in child due to low number of case during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with current circulation of respiratory viruses.We would like to use OpenSAFELY (traditional code based and interactive) to analyse presentation to NHS services, recording of symptom and diagnostic test in people NHS record a well a any treatments, such a antibiotics. We will evaluate data in the year preceding the pandemic up until the latest available data.Our expected output will be charts, blog and academic paper describing our findings.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford Project #145: Association between ursodeoxycholic acid and COVID-19 outcomesType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is used routinely to treat a liver condition called primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and is taken long-term to prevent the disease progressing. There is some biological evidence UDCA may prevent serious COVID-19 outcomes. A small study using observational liver disease registry data showed le severe COVID-19 outcome in those taking UDCA. We plan to test this association in a much larger population using OpenSAFELY data. The study population will be all people with PBC, we will compare COVID-19 death in those treated with UDCA to those not treated with UDCA initially in first year of the pandemic, and then further extended up to the end of 2022.This is important for those at high-risk of COVID-19, for whom vaccination are le effective, where treatment to prevent the disease may be important to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19.Study lead: Organisation: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #144: COVID-19 impact on anastrazole use by post-menopausal woman with hormone-dependent breast cancerType: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareWe want to know whether anastrazole use ha been impacted by COVID-19. Anastrazole is a type of hormone treatment, which work by lowering the level of oestrogen hormone in your body. It is mainly prescribed for woman who have been through the menopause and have hormone-dependent breast cancer. It is however also prescribed to prevent breast cancer if you are at high risk and have been through the menopause; or to treat breast cancer in men and younger women; or a fertility treatment if you have polycystic ovary syndrome.It is taken a a tablet once a daily, and will usually be taken for five to ten years. Some people start taking it after a number of year of taking another hormone therapy drug called tamoxifen. It is estimated from primary care prescribing data that around 70,000 patient have been prescribed anastrazole in the year from February 2021 to January 2022. Issuance in secondary care wa between 40-50,000 per month up to March 2020 when it fell to almost 30,000 per month, and ha gradually recovered over the last two years. Important to know what impact COVID may have had on this treatment for cancer.Study lead: Organisation: NHS England Project #143: Comparison of risk factor for hospitalization and death from winter infectionsType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]COVID-19, flu, and other infection are more common in winter, and the effect of non-COVID infection may be exacerbated in people co-infected with COVID-19. Some risk factors, for example asthma or high blood pressure, may make you more likely to be infected or to become severely ill. When you visit your doctor or go to a hospital, information on your medical condition is recorded. Approved researcher can access this information. We will use this information to learn more about which factor may make you more likely to have COVID-19 and other common infection in winter, and to become severely ill because of these infections. We also want to learn about which risk factor are linked with just COVID-19 and which are linked with multiple infections. Knowing this will enable doctor and other health care professional to take extra care of people at risk. This should mean that they are le likely to need to see a doctor or go to hospital because of COVID-19 and other infections. It may also reduce winter pressure on the national health service.Study leads: ,,,,Organisation: University of Bristol, University of Cambridge, and University of Oxford Project #142: The impact of COVID-19 on prescribing of antimicrobialsType: Service evaluation and AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareUsing antimicrobial medicine carefully and only when needed, also known a antimicrobial stewardship, is an important step to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance and a key national priority.The COVID-19 pandemic ha had an impact on antibiotic prescribing. For example using openly available medicine data we have previously found (see blog ) that substantially more prescription were issued for antibiotic used to treat respiratory condition while prescribing for antibiotic for condition like urinary tract infection decreased.We would like to use OpenSAFELY-Interactive to describe trend and variation in specific clinical condition (e.g. COPD) and different patient demographic group (e.g. children/those resident in a care home). General practice give out the majority of antibiotic in England so we will focus on prescribing in primary care and our expected output will be charts, blog and academic paper describing our findings.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford Project #141: The impact of COVID-19 on the care of people with sickle cell disease.Type: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareSickle cell disease is the name for a group of inherited health condition that affect the red blood cells. It is a lifelong condition where severe pain episodes, lasting days-weeks, develop episodically. It also increase the risk of infection and anaemia that can cause tiredness and shortness of breath.During the pandemic people with sickle cell disease were advised to shield and it is also possible that their care wa affected due to the indirect impact of the pandemic. Additionally we have found that people with sickle cell disease who were eligible for COVID-19 therapeutic in the community, got lower access to these treatment than others (see OpenSAFELY Reports).We would like to use OpenSAFELY-Interactive to ass the impact of the COVID-19 on the care of people with sickle cell disease in primary care. For example we will describe the number of people captured in primary care record before and after the onset of the pandemic which may indicate any disruption in the sickle cell screening programme, describe the trend in prescription for pain to the group and prescribing of antimicrobial to manage symptoms. Our expected output will be charts, blog and academic paper describing our findings.Examples of specific measure for people with sickle cell disease that we would like to ass using OpenSAFELY-Interactive include; Measure of coding for sickle cell (trait/disease); coding of sickle cell crisis, trend in certain prescription such a painkiller and antibiotics.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford Project #140: Incidence and management of gout during and before the COVID-19 pandemicType: Service EvaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareRationale: Gout is by far the most common cause of inflamed joint worldwide, yet one of the worst managed. There are very effective medication that can prevent flare of pain and swelling in people with gout. However, previous study have shown that patient with gout are often not prescribed these medications. National guideline have been introduced with the aim of encouraging the optimal treatment of gout, but there remains very limited data on how care for people with gout ha been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or by the introduction of these guidelines.Aim and Methods: Our goal is to use routinely collected data from electronic medical record through OpenSAFELY, to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic ha impact on the quality of care for people with gout in England.We will evaluate national and regional change in several important aspect of care, which align with national recommendations, including: i) the number of new diagnosis of gout; ii) the prescription of guideline-recommended treatments; iii) the monitoring and attainment of treatment targets; iv) and the number of hospital admission for gout flares.We will investigate trend in these outcome using interrupted time-series models, which will enable u to compare pre-pandemic, early pandemic and late pandemic phases.Expected output of project: In the short term, this project will highlight area for improvement at national and regional level in England. In the long term, this routinely captured data will be used to monitor for improvement in care for patient with gout.Study lead: Organisation: Kings College London Project #139: Risk factor for COVID-19 disease progression in immunocompromised populationsType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]Individuals with compromised immune system are particularly vulnerable to the effect of SARS-CoV-2, and have endured a disproportionate burden of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality throughout the course of the pandemic. Although risk factor for severe disease in the general population have been explored in detail, few study have focused specifically on immunocompromised individuals.Our study aim to identify factor associated with disease progression among immunocompromised individual infected during the Omicron wave of the pandemic. The population of interest includes immunocompromised individual a defined by: solid organ transplant; bone marrow transplant; haematologic malignancy; primary or acquired immunosuppressive condition; recent immunosuppressive medication; or recent chemotherapy or radiotherapy.Key risk factor of interest include vaccination status, prior infection, and clinical comorbidities, among others. A better understanding of how these factor shape the risk of severe disease in immunocompromised population may help identify individual who may benefit from access to emerging therapeutic and support targeted clinical trial recruitment.Study lead: Organisation: London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Project #138: Hypertension and blood pressure in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)Type: Service EvaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareGeneral practice ha been disrupted by the pandemic in many clinical area (e.g., Curtis et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2020). We aim to ass the impact of the pandemic on the routine management of blood pressure and hypertension. High blood pressure is one of the leading risk factor for several disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease, stroke) worldwide. Research suggests that delay in the management of high blood pressure are associated with worse clinical outcomes, for example acute cardiovascular events, or death (Xu et al., 2015).The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) outline several indicator that focus on blood pressure (BP) and hypertension (HYP) targets. We aim to use OpenSAFELY to quantify the extent to which any of the relevant QOF indicator were disrupted during the pandemic but wont link our result to clinical outcomes.Our expected output include: (1) clinical report will be published at , (2) reusable analytic code and codelists will be available for other researcher to use and modify, and (2) peer-reviewed academic paper discussing our result including actionable suggestion for service improvement within the NHS. Our output will be published timely and updated continuously. Further, we aim to supplement the aggregated result available at with detailed breakdown of important demographic category to ass health inequalities.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford Project #137: Healthcare need for people with chronic kidney disease in the COVID-19 eraType: Research/Service EvaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareBackground:Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem facing unprecedented challenge due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. CKD patient were amongst those at the greatest risk of death and severe illness a a result of COVID-19, whilst restriction and the subsequent backlog have impacted healthcare access. Monitoring of CKD by GP practice may have been impacted due to stretched resource and change to remuneration, while kidney transplantation programme had to be paused at times.Aim:In this project, we plan to make use of existing healthcare data from across England to determine how healthcare use and quality of life ha varied year on year since 2017-2018 for people with CKD.Proposed methods:We will undertake analysis for each financial year from 2017-2018 to 2022-2023.For each year, we will report the number of people with CKD at the beginning of each financial year, grouped into different CKD severity group including dialysis patient and kidney transplant recipients. We will then describe various measure of healthcare need by each CKD group for each quarter of each year.For people not on dialysis or with kidney transplant, we will report how many people in each CKD group either progressed to a more advanced stage of CKD or died each year. For people on dialysis or with kidney transplant, we will describe the number of people who died.From our count of healthcare needs, we will estimate the cost across each financial year from 2017-2018 to 2022-2023 for each CKD stage. We will estimate the average healthcare cost per person for each CKD stage, investigating further for geographical and socioeconomic disparities. We will then estimate the quality of life impact across each year for each CKD group, again investigating further for geographical and socioeconomic disparities. Topic areasStudy leads: ,Organisation: London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Project #136: GP appointment during COVIDType: Service EvaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareWe are interested in describing and measuring the effect of COVID disruption on GP appointments. We have access to a database of GP appointment data that contains appointment scheduling information for 40% of the population in England.We would like to explore the data in more detail to look at pattern over time to assist with health service recovery from COVID-19. We are particularly interested in looking at appointment lead time, which mean the time between requesting an appointment and the appointment date. We will explore whether this (and other measure of interest) change over time, particularly before, during and after COVID. In addition to looking at this for the whole population, we will look at change in particular subgroup of patients; for example, in particular age group or ethnic groups, or for group of patient with the same diagnosis (e.g., mental health).With a better idea of how access to GP appointment varied over time for these groups, we would like to explore the data in more detail by applying data science methodology to identify any short- and long-term pattern of change. We will be asking question like: were some practice able to reduce appointment lead time faster than others in the COVID recovery period? If so, do those practice have any characteristic in common? This is important a it may help u identify best practice and describe the most effective and efficient response to primary care disruption due to COVID-19 in the future.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford Project #135: Impact of COVID-19 on diabetes care in EnglandType: Service Evaluation/AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareDiabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is too high. It can happen when your body doesnt produce enough insulin, the body own insulin is not effective, or if your body cannot produce any insulin at all. Prolonged high blood sugar level can have negative health consequences, such a seriously damaging your heart, eyes, feet, or kidneys. The aim of diabetes treatment is to keep your blood glucose at a healthy level, to lower your chance of getting complications.The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption to healthcare services. A reduction in routine blood sugar monitoring and subsequent treatment adjustment in diabetes patient may increase the risk of complication for these individuals.The purpose of this study is to describe any change in routine diabetic management during the COVID-19 pandemic, signalled by change to measure defined in NICE guidance. For example we plan to report the overall rate of diabetes within the study population and then describe variation in both diabetes monitoring and treatment. Additionally we plan to report difference between subgroup of interest, for example: age groups, geographical regions, other illness This may help to better understand inequality in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight potential area for further research and improvement.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford Project #134: Impact of COVID-19 in people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemiaType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a cancer which affect white blood cell that mostly affect people over age 60. Individuals with CLL have weaker immune system and therefore are at great risk from both contracting, and subsequently experiencing severe outcome from, COVID-19. Vaccines within the CLL population are thought to be le effective than in the general population.The purpose of this study is to describe trend over time in CLL measures, such a the mortality rate, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to compare trend within the CLL subpopulation against a subpopulation without CLL. Additionally we plan to report difference between subgroup of interest, for example: age groups, geographical regions, other illnesses. There are many factor that could affect mortality risk, such as: behavioural intervention (e.g. lockdowns, mask wearing), vaccination status of individuals, or the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 circulating within the population. To provide context to our mortality rates, we will describe the temporal population-wide state of these factors.This may help to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual with CLL.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford Project #133: Effect of COVID-19 on prescribing of Dependence Forming Medicines and the associated health utilisationType: Service EvaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareDuring COVID-19, GPs have supported people to manage a decline in their mental wellbeing. Many service and community activity were not available during COVID and this may have resulted in change to prescribing of drug a a result of declining mental wellbeing. Certain medicine that are effective in the short term to elevate symptom of poor mental wellbeing can cause dependence. This study will establish any change to what dependence forming medicine have been prescribed, how alternative to medication have been employed and the impact this ha on people in term of how often they turn to their GP for continuing support.Study lead: Organisation: PrescQIPP C.I.C. Project #132: Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 on QOF registered patient and health group that experience inequalitiesType: Service EvaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareAnalysis to ass the statistical variation in patient demographic receiving care incentivised via the QOF and how this ha changed or been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery of Primary Care Services.It is widely believed, although not previously analysed in detail, that there will be a difference in the demographic of patient who receive and those who do not receive care via QOF incentivised activities. We would be seeking to analyse the effect of COVID-19 on these difference by directly comparing data before the pandemic with data during the pandemic (including post-pandemic recovery).The expectation is that the result of this are disseminated within NHSE a a policy development paper. With wider code and result published a per OpenSAFELYs standard procedure.Study leads: ,,Organisation: NHS England Project #131: SLE and COVID-19Type: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a condition where the body attack itself, so it can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, and the nervous system. It is expected that people with SLE will be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 because the medication used for the condition will reduce a person immunity and ability to fight infections. This study aim to investigate if SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) and/or the treatment of SLE increase a person chance of getting COVID-19,if they get it more severely and if they are more likely to develop long COVID-19. We will also examine if having COVID increase a person chance of developing SLE. We will look back in individual record to examine how many people with SLE developed COVID-19 and if they had more severe disease compared to people without SLE. We will use the record of people in the OpenSAFELY and the SAIL database in Wales between 1st March 2020 to 31st December 2021. OpenSafely cover 96% of the GP population in England and SAIL cover 98% of the GP population in Wales.Study lead: Organisation: Swansea University Project #130: Surveillance of psychiatric emergency over time to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on mental health. A cohort study using OpenSafelyType: AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, and of the measure introduced to control it, is not yet fully understood. To date, we know that mental health of the population wa affected, and that primary care, secondary care and emergency department consultation related to mental health decreased dramatically in the first phase of the pandemic. We also know that the system ha changed in response to the pandemic, for example more virtual consultation are now conducted with the reduction in face-to-face consultation a compared to before the pandemic. In this research, we will quantify the change during the COVID-19 pandemic in trend of psychiatric emergency across different patient groups. We will investigate the following psychiatric emergencies: self-harm, suicide-related, alcohol-related, eating disorders-related, and home violence-related hospitalisation and emergency department visits, a well a mortality (due to above mentioned psychiatric emergencies). We will compare the trend (counts and rates) in psychiatric emergency observed (that actually happened) during the COVID-19 pandemic to trend that would be expected if the pandemic had not happened (predicted using mathematical models). With this, we will investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on 1) mental health of the population, 2) the severity of psychiatric emergencies, 3) service utilisation by patient and 4) inequality between different patient groups. This research is important to support patients, healthcare professionals, and the healthcare system in the recovery from the pandemic.Study lead: Organisation: University of Surrey Project #129: Curation of GP appointment dataType: AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareWe are interested in describing and measuring the effect of COVID disruption on GP appointments. We have access to a database of GP appointment data that contains appointment scheduling information for 40% of the population in England. Because we havent used this dataset before, we will first check that the data within it look sensible; for example: is the date on which an appointment is booked always before the appointment date? Do we always know when an appointment is booked? If this information is missing, can we find any pattern of where it is missing (e.g., do some practice tend not to record it)? Does it look like some appointment are repeated in the dataset? These kind of check will help u decide whether any additional data cleaning step need to be implemented before we carry out any our analyses.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford Project #128: The effect of COVID-19 infection and vaccination on PSA level in menType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThere is a theory that COVID-19 disease and vaccination could could lead to inflammation in the prostate, increasing level in the blood of the prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA test is a common prostate cancer screening offered to men. So an increase in PSA could lead to unnecessary and harmful false cancer flags.This is study we will investigate the possible effect of the COVID-19 vaccination and infection on PSA levels. We will also investigate how long the effect is.This research could help u understand more about the potential effect of COVID-19 on PSA and alert clinician to be vigilant. It will help the patient and clinician to use the PSA testing more effectively and interpret the result more appropriately.Study lead: Organisation: University of Surrey Project #127: Prostate cancer incidence and prevalence in the COVID-19 pandemicType: Service EvaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareCancer service including cancer diagnosis were heavily disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study wa designed to investigate the effect of the pandemic on prostate cancer diagnosis overall and by demographic such a age, ethnicity, deprivation, region. We will use primary care record to describe the trend in diagnosis (new and existing) over time from January 2015 to October 2022. We will look if different subgroup of patient (age, ethnicity, deprivation, region) were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in a different way. This knowledge gained from this study will help NHS understand if there wa an effect of the pandemic on prostate cancer diagnosis and if this wa different for patient with different demographic characteristics. The knowledge could help the NHS improve the service post-pandemic and address the potential backlog that wa created by the pandemic.Study lead: Organisation: University of Surrey Project #126: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Antipsychotic Prescribing in at risk groupsType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcarePrior to the pandemic the NHS had recognised that prescribing of antipsychotic wa excessive in certain at-risk population including in patient with dementia, learning disability, autism and those in care homes. Antipsychotics are licensed to treat serious mental illness, but they can also be used to manage behaviour where patient are severely distressed or at risk of harming themselves or others.During the pandemic many of the social and charitable structure that supported people with disability were substantially affected and researcher have described the negative consequence in these at-risk groups, including increase in agitation, anxiety, depressive symptom and negative behaviour such a aggressive and self harming behaviours.The purpose of this study is to determine if the COVID-19 pandemic affected the rate of prescribing of Antipsychotic Prescribing in individual with autism, dementia, learning disability, serious mental illness or those resident in a care home.Study lead: Organisation: Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust Project #125: What wa the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medication reviews?Type: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareMedication review are an important aspect of primary care to ensure that a patient prescribed medication are safe, effective and appropriate. The COVID-19 pandemic ha been shown to have caused significant disruption to healthcare services. A reduction in the frequency of medication review may increase the risk of harm from medication and/or result in suboptimal management of long term conditions.There is no single definition of what constitutes a medication review. A medication review can ensure the appropriateness of a prescribed medication or ensure appropriate monitoring ha taken place. They may be undertaken to review all of a patient current repeat prescription or to review medication for a single condition only. For example, the review may ensure that a patient prescribed medicine to lower their blood pressure, ha had their blood pressure checked recently.The purpose of this study is to observe change in the number of medication review conducted in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic.The study will report the rate of medication review overall and then describe variation between key clinical, regional, and demographic subgroup (e.g., Index of Multiple Deprivation, ethnicity, or a record of learning disability). This may help to better understand inequality in healthcare and highlight potential area for further research and improvement.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #124: Describing pattern of BMI recording in primary care recordsType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareBMI ha been identified a a risk factor for clinical outcome in patient with COVID-19. Electronic Health Records (EHR) hold significant potential for studying the association between BMI and COVID-19. This depends on the validity, completeness, and currency of BMI information that is available in or can be derived from EHR. Thus, this study aim to describe and compare method for identifying BMI in EHR.The study will check for consistency, completeness, and precision of the BMI variable, comparing the two method of identifying BMI in OpenSAFELY: (1) calculation from height and weight and (2) GP-recorded values. It will evaluate the validity of each method (e.g., identify proportion of missing value or value out of range) and summarise any discrepancy across the two methods. Furthermore, it will aim to evaluate whether there are any pattern in missingness by relevant subgroup in the population.The analysis will be completed using primary care EHRs of adult between 21 and 110 year registered with a GP-surgery using TPP and EMIS on 1 March 2020. Descriptive table will be produced to describe missing and out of range values. Between 1 March 2015 to 1 March 2020, unique BMI for each patient will be considered to summarise how often BMI record are updated (average number of unique record over 5 years, average duration between BMI updates). Analyses will be performed for the overall population a well a by demographic categories, clinical conditions, and practice/region/STP.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #123: PINCER change detectionType: AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareMedication related harm describes any error related to prescribing that may cause harm to a patient (e.g., prescribing a medicine at the wrong dose or not carrying out a necessary blood test before prescribing a medicine). Some important indicator of medication related harm have been designed a part of the PINCER programme, which help pharmacist find instance of potentially hazardous prescribing in the electronic health record of their practices, so that clinically important error can be reduced.We are interested in understanding whether these PINCER hazardous prescribing indicator were affected by the disruption of primary care service due to COVID-19 and to what extent those rate of medication related harm have recovered since primary care service were restored. Once we have an overall understanding of how rate have changed, we would like to explore the data in more detail by looking at the rate for each practice over time and applying data science methodology to identify any short- and long-term pattern of change. We will be asking question like: are there any practice that did not experience any COVID-19 disruption in their PINCER indicators? Were some practice able to recover faster than others? Should we find any practice that correspond to these patterns, we will explore whether these practice have any characteristic in common. This is important a it may help u identify best practice and describe the most effective and efficient response to primary care disruption in the future.We do consider this project a proof of concept, in which we demonstrate the utility of our approach. The intention in the longer term is to use the same analysis pipeline across all clinical area to identify variation in change over time and expose factor associated with positive change over time.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #122: Opioid prescribing trend and change during COVID-19Type: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThe COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measure have led to disruption to the healthcare system, including prescribing behaviour. Internationally, increase in opioid prescribing to people in care home and a shift away from non-pharmacological treatment to opioids for people with pain since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic have raised concerns, and in the UK there have been report of increased opioid use in people on outpatient procedure waiting lists. Prior to COVID-19, there were concern about high opioid prescribing rate in the UK, especially for non-cancer pain and in area of greater social deprivation. Thus it is important to understand if and how prescribing behaviour ha changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how this varies by sociodemographic factors.We will use OpenSAFELY data to identify all registered adult prescribed opioids from Jan 2018 to Mar 2022. We will describe rate of opioid prescribing prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and estimate any change in prescribing pattern in the two year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in relation to the start date of the nationwide lockdowns. By focussing on key subgroup (people in care homes, people without cancer) and stratifying by relevant characteristic (age, Index of Multiple Deprivation, region) we will identify which group were most affected which can help identify target for improved prescribing.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #121: PHOSPType: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID], Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareAn increased risk of Covid-19 infection and subsequent admission to hospital with COVID ha been seen in group already carrying a burden of biological, psychological and social risk factor (e.g. poverty, poor housing and unemployment) associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes. Many patient with COVID have required treatment on Intensive Care Units. There is a substantial literature on the emergence of psychiatric illness after discharge from ICU. We know that many patient who have had Covid-19 develop a psychiatric disorder, although the reason for this are unclear. Our study aim to help understand better how poor mental health after admission to hospital with Covid-19 is related to patient experience in hospital (e.g admission to ICU), and how much is explained by difficulty experienced by patient before they became ill. We will use data collected about patient hospital admissions, information they provide in a questionnaire about life before Covid, and some information from their GP record about overall health and functioning.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Leeds Project #120: Long-term kidney outcome following hospitalisation with Covid-19Type: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]In our previous research using a study called ISARIC, we studied people who became unwell with Covid-19 and had complication related to their kidneys. We found which people were most likely to have kidney complication and what effect this had on their survival. In this new project, we will study whether kidney complication are unique to Covid-19 or whether similar problem develop from other infections. We will also study the long-term kidney effect of being unwell with Covid-19. These subject are important because complication related to kidney are the most common amongst people with Covid-19. We need to know more about what impact Covid-19 ha on long-term kidney health.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and University of Glasgow Project #119: The healthcare utilisation of people with long COVIDType: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]According to a survey published in May 2022 by the Office for National Statistics, 1.8 million people, nearing 3% of the total UK population, had long COVID. The number of long COVID case is enormous; however, the impact on the healthcare system ha not yet been quantified. Our study aim to investigate the healthcare utilisation of people with long COVID and the risk factor for high user of healthcare resources.We will identify people with long COVID using their electronic health record and analyse their healthcare contact and costs, specifically primary care consultation, accident and emergency room visits, secondary care (inpatient and outpatient), and prescriptions. In addition, we will explore the potential factor associated with high healthcare utilisation among people with long COVID and compare their healthcare utilisation to historical record before the pandemic.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #118: Expected Background Rates of Clinical Events in Immunocompromised PatientsType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareAlternatives to COVID vaccine are being developed for people whose immune system is compromised, and who therefore are unable to benefit from currently available vaccines. One example is Evusheld, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies, tixagevimab and cilgavimab. Once these treatment are launched, their safety will be closely monitored for example through spontaneous reporting of suspected adverse drug reaction by patients, carers and healthcare professionals. In order to contextualise potential safety signal arising from spontaneous reporting, a detailed understanding of the background rate of key clinical event in an immunocompromised population is required. This will help with the interpretation of potential signals, and to prioritise which study should be done to further investigate signals. This study will therefore describe the underlying rate of key clinical outcome in immunocompromised people in the UK.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #117: Understanding and adjusting for bias in OpenSAFELY COVID testing dataType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareBackground: OpenSAFELY is a secure research platform that includes data from 58 million English patients. OpenSAFELY ha been used to answer important question about COVID-19, influencing policy decision and increasing our understanding of the effect of the virus. OpenSAFELY hold data from national PCR and lateral flow testing. Importantly, the availability of testing ha changed over the course of the pandemic, and testing wa often driven by patient choice. This ha likely led to important difference between people who had COVID-19 test and those who did not. These difference mean that study using the testing data might produce incorrect results, unless these difference can be accounted for in the study. This is important for COVID-19 and for future UK pandemics.Aim: The aim of this project is to determine how we can account for difference in testing in OpenSAFELY to address important question in COVID-19, and then how we can use this to inform policy for future pandemics.Methods: We will use linked data from OpenSAFELY and the ONS COVID-19 Infection Survey (ONS CIS). ONS CIS is much smaller than OpenSAFELY but it randomly sampled household across the UK and regularly tested all participants, which mean that the data were not reliant on access to testing or patient choice. We will compare people who tested positive in ONS CIS to those who tested positive in OpenSAFELY. We will then look at risk factor for hospitalisation and death among those with recorded COVID-19 infection in OpenSAFELY, and use method to understand how using the national testing data (rather than regularly testing everyone) might have led to incorrect results. Finally, we will use various statistical method to try and overcome any error introduced by use of COVID-19 testing data.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Office for National Statistics Project #116: Further analysis of DOAC prescribing for patient with mechanical heart valvesType: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, NHS England issued guidance around prescribing of anticoagulant (commonly known a blood thinners); recommending a switch from warfarin to a newer type of anticoagulant, commonly known a DOACs, in some group of patients. This wa partially due to the need for le frequent blood testing in patient prescribed a DOAC. However, DOACs are not recommended for patient with a mechanical heart valve. This study aim to carry on and refine previous work on DOAC prescribing in patient with a mechanical heart valve.Study lead: Organisation: NHS England and NHS Improvement Project #115: Effectiveness of sotrovimab/molnupiravir use v non-useType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]In December 2021, COVID-19 medicine delivery unit were launched across England to offer antiviral medicine and neutralsing monoclonal antibody to nonhospitalised COVID-19 patient thought to be at high risk of severe outcomes. Amid understandable concern surrounding early regulatory authorisations, noninterventional evidence surrounding the effectiveness of these medication is needed to guide policy surrounding the use of these medication in routine clinical practice. We aim to emulate a randomised trial using observational data to estimate the effectiveness (prevention of hospitalisation and death) of either sotrovimab or molnupiravir versus no-treatment, amongst non-hospitalised COVID-19 patient in one of the high-risk groups.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #114: Ethnicity Short Data ReportType: Short Data ReportTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareCapturing ethnicity information in routine health record is recognized a a necessary pre-requisite to understanding and addressing inequality in health service usage and outcomes. OpenSAFELY ha been, and continues to be, used to support research that delivered urgent result related to the global COVID-19 emergency.Assessing sample representativeness, consistency and completeness is a critical component of health research and provides context for researcher to understand the validity / applicability of their research.SummaryThis study profile the representativeness, consistency and completeness of routinely collected primary care ethnicity data.Intended Outputs:Short data report on ethnicity variablesBuild on data curation / validation framework to support future workStudy lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #113: Shared care monitoring: the impact of COVID-19 and factor associated with resilienceType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThis study aim to evaluate whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected the completion of shared care drug monitoring. It also considers whether any such effect wa associated with other variables, such a patient demographic or comorbidities.The analysis will cover all patient registered with a GP practice aged 18 year and over, who are currently prescribed currently prescribed Azathioprine, Methotrexate, Mercaptopurine, Mycophenolate, Leflunomide or Levothyroxine.Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on monitoring is important, a in the short-term this will lay the foundation for an analysis of the health impact and recovery planning, and in the longer-term an analysis of whether current monitoring recommendation remain appropriate. Furthermore, understanding factor which underpin variance in resilience to the impact of COVID-19 on monitoring adherence may be valuable learning points, with a view to increasing the resilience of the population overall, and reducing health inequality between the least and most resilient segments.Study lead: Organisation: Sunderland CCG, University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #112: The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on rheumatoid arthritis care and non-COVID outcomesType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareRheumatology service were directly affected during the pandemic, a rheumatologist were frequently seconded to treat COVID-19 patients, rheumatology appointment were moved to remote appointment and drug monitoring wa reduced. The impact of these change ha not been measured. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are treated with immunosuppressive medication that require blood monitoring for toxicity and patient are monitored by a rheumatologist to manage the disease activity, thereby preventing further complications. This study will identify a rheumatoid arthritis population between 1st March 2018 to 30th April 2022 from the OpenSAFELY platform and will measure blood monitoring and associated outcomes, 2) rheumatology outpatient appointments, 3) hospital admission and 4) deaths. The impact of the pandemic will be measured by comparing the pre-pandemic period to the pandemic period.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #111: OpenSAFELY Interactive PILOTType: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareOpenSAFELY is a powerful platform for analysing patient record in English primary care and other linked healthcare datasets. After rapid development at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020), we launched a pilot programme to allow external research/informatics group to use the platform for COVID-19-related questions. This ha been highly successful; however, such project application require a certain technical skillset, and there is a relatively long lead-time to start performing analyses; although feedback from user is that the onboarding time is relatively short compared with many platform (typically 5-10 weeks), it is not possible to conduct any rapid analysis. While we are creating dashboard that show activity in selected clinical areas, we would like to permit some simple count to be accessible more flexibly and widely, for example, for policy expert and other individual involved in NHS service planning, commissioning, monitoring and best practice guideline development.For the pilot phase, access will be provided to a defined group of NHS England policy makers. Once approved, individual will be able to submit simple analyses, by selecting a clinical codelist (a list of clinical code used to capture all the way an activity or condition may have been recorded, e.g. a blood test or asthma) from the OpenCodelists tool. For the pilot phase, only codelists which have been used for existing OpenSAFELY COVID-19 related project on OpenCodelists.org will be incorporated into the tool. Users also select a time period and a small range of other options.For the pilot phase, we propose the following category of analyses, returned to the requester within a simple PDF/html. The number of occurrence of the chosen codelist are counted over the selected time period and figure may include: a table of the most common code within the codelist, variation in code use between practice per week/month, rate broken down by sex/age group/ethnicity/region. Patient count will be rounded and small number suppressed to protect patient privacy. We will apply automated statistical disclosure control where appropriate, and where necessary result will be reviewed prior to release by trained output-checkers. Practices will not be identified; except in case where an appropriate governance approval ha been granted, such a a practice requesting to identify only it own data within a graph of other practices.Using this tool user will be able to: preview codelists; see which code in a particular codelist are most often used; ass the change over time in a particular clinical activity; get an indication of the level of coding of conditions/activities of interest; or ensure an activity/outcome of interest is recorded in sufficient number to permit further analysis prior to submitting a full project application.In the pilot phase, result are not publishable - but used to inform development of OpenSAFELY-Interactive.Study lead: Organisation: NHS England and University of Oxford Medicine Project #110: COVID-19 vaccine coverage and effectiveness in chronic kidney disease patientsType: Service evaluationTopic areas: COVID vaccine effectiveness/safetyChronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of several factor that make a person substantially more vulnerable to COVID-19. Not only are individual with CKD at greater risk of severe disease if infected, but they are le likely to respond adequately to current COVID-19 vaccines. Accordingly, individual with CKD were among the earliest to be offered COVID-19 vaccine in the UK, and have subsequently been offered up to two further dos with the aim of providing stronger and more durable protection against severe disease.This project will use the OpenSAFELY platform to answer two key questions. First, what level of vaccine coverage have been achieved in CKD patients? Second, how doe vaccine effectiveness (VE) vary among CKD patient who have received different type of vaccine? Where possible, the project will distinguish between key subgroup of CKD patients, such a those who have received organ transplant or dialysis. For the analysis of VE, key objective will be to compare vectored (ChAdOx1-S) versus mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccines, and heterologous (mix-and-match) versus homologous (single type) schedules.The study will thus identify how effectively CKD patient have been reached during different phase of vaccine roll-out, and how effective different vaccination strategy have been in this vulnerable population.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and UK Kidney Association Project #108: Hepatitis in Children related to the pandemicType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]; Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]UKHSA ha recently detected higher than usual rate of liver inflammation (hepatitis) in child in England ().Possible cause are being investigated including COVID-19 and other cause such adenovirus ; it is thought that change in pattern of circulating virus due to COVID-19 pandemic regulation could have also contributed to this outbreak.In order to support the response team investigation to prevent harm to child the OpenSAFELY team is conducting an analysis to provide data to inform the response. We will look at data on the recording of clinical code on childrens electronic health record and provide chart on the trend over time. For example we will look at how many child have record that indicate they may have a gastrointestinal illness, a key sign of liver inflammation on child presenting in general practice for symptom such a gastrointestinal illness and look for change in the number of liver function test in child which GPs may order to further investigate and diagnose hepatitis.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #107: Evaluating the potential effect of statin on COVID-19 outcome using regression discontinuity and instrumental variable approachesType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]; Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]In the past year a body of research ha emerged highlighting a potential link between treatment with statin and COVID-19 related outcomes. Bergqvist el al (2021), for example, find that individual taking statin were at a lower risk of death attributable to COVID-19. This is potentially explained by the role of statin in reducing inflammation and blood clotting, feature frequently observed in severe COVID-19 cases.In this study we aim to further explore the extent to which a causal relationship between statin use and COVID-19 outcome exists using a regression discontinuity study design, a well a instrumental variable (IV) method (using QRISK a an IV for example). Such approach have the potential to adjust for source of bias common in observational studies, which have currently been employed by the majority of study investigating the relationship between statin and COVID-19 outcomes. In this way, this study will potentially provide greater insight into the mechanism underpinning COVID-19 related health outcomes.Applying such method will provide a different perspective which can be incorporated within an evidence triangulation framework to better inform health policy with respect to the use of statin in preventing adverse COVID-19 health outcomes. We anticipate the result of this study will be presented in the form of a peer-reviewed paper, and potentially a subsequent paper formally triangulating evidence from multiple study of differing design.ReferencesBergqvist R, Ahlqvist VH, Lundberg M, Hergens M-P, Sundstrm J, Bell M, et al.

Study lead: Organisation: University of Bristol Project #106: Effectiveness and safety of sotrovimab and molnupiravir for prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomesType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]On 16th December 2021, COVID-19 Medicine Delivery Units (CMDUs) were launched across England to provide antiviral medicine and neutralising monoclonal antibody (nMAbs) to treat COVID-19 patient in community setting who are at high risk of severe outcomes. The approval and early clinical use of these medication have been mainly supported by evidence from several randomised controlled trial of limited size. It is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these medication on preventing COVID-19 disease progression in real-world setting with wider populations.This study aim to examine and compare the effectiveness of sotrovimab and molnupiravir, the two most frequently prescribed medication by CMDUs so far, in non-hospitalised high-risk adult patient with COVID-19 across England. The main comparator group are patient who received sotrovimab vs. those who received molnupiravir, between whom the risk of COVID-19 related hospitalisation/death within 29 day after treatment initiation (and other efficacy/safety outcome of interest) will be compared.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #105: Antidepressant trend in those with Learning Disability and Autism and change during CovidType: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThe STOMP initiative launched in 2016 sought to reduce inappropriate prescribing of psychotropics among those with learning disability and autism (LD&A). Many non-pharmacological option to managing anxiety, distress and behavioural problem in LD&A require access to specialist staff, communal spaces, specialist learning environment and much of this wa restricted during the COVID-19 lockdown.In the Quality and Outcomes Framework, 2020-2021 report, NHS Digital found depression to have the greatest increase in QOF recorded prevalence, an increase of 0.7 percentage point from 2019-2020. The QOF framework also includes an indicator for depression diagnosis review.This study will describe how the diagnosis and review of depression and the use of psychotropic medicine in the vulnerable LD&A population may have changed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS will be used to identify patient of any age with a diagnosis of learning disability or autism. For the study period of January 2018 to January 2022 monthly rate of current and new depression diagnosis and current and new antidepressant prescription will be described, looking separately at Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) and other antidepressant (Tricyclics, Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOIs) and others). Based on the QOF metric DEP003, the monthly rate of individual 18 and older who received a review for a new diagnosis of depression within 10 to 65 day will also be described.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #104: Predictors of asymptomatic versus symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2Type: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]SARS-CoV-2 infection are often asymptomatic. Asymptomatic infection are challenging to pandemic control because they are a substantial source of transmission but are difficult to identify (and therefore target directly) within the resource constraint of health systems. New knowledge about characteristic of individual that are associated with asymptomatic (versus symptomatic) infection may inform public health policy and clinical understanding of COVID-19. In this study, we will use national household survey data linked to patient general practice record to investigate the symptoms, if any, reported by individual with a SARS-CoV-2 infection in England. We will examine factor that may be associated with whether an infection result in symptom or not, such a socio-demographic characteristics, pre-existing health conditions, vaccination and prior infection, and the SARS-CoV-2 variant and load.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #103: Covid Symptom Study Biobank Long CovidType: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID], COVID vaccine effectiveness/safety, Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareWe are investigating the characteristic of those with long covid within the Covid Symptom Study Biobank longitudinal cohort study. We would like to use OpenSAFELY Electronic Health Records to gather information such a past diagnosis of long-covid, other comorbidities and vaccination status that would otherwise be unavailable; this will help to enhance our understanding of the factor which lead to long covid and determine it severity.Study lead: Organisation: Kings College London Project #102: The impact of COVID-19 on prescribing of long-term and repeated antimicrobial in primary care to evaluate antimicrobial stewardship interventionsType: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThe number of infection that have become resistant to antibiotic treatment ha increased over the past years. This antibiotic resistance can be driven by increased antibiotic use. Using antibiotic carefully and only when needed, also known a antimicrobial stewardship, is therefore important to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance.The COVID-19 pandemic ha had an impact on antibiotic prescribing. For example, it ha resulted in more prescription being given for dental infections. General Practitioners also say that they were more likely to give antibiotic for throat infection during the pandemic, hence increasing antibiotic use.General practice give out the majority of antibiotic in England. This project therefore will investigate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic ha had on long-term and repeated antimicrobial prescribing in general practice. This includes, for example, antibiotic prescribed regularly for infection of the lung, bladder and skin.AimsEvaluate the impact of COVID-19 on long-term and repeated prescription of antimicrobial in general practiceProduce guidance tool to support healthcare colleague in general practice to review patient on long-term and/or repeated antimicrobialsShare knowledge with scientific colleague to encourage wise use of antibiotic and help reduce antibiotic resistanceStudy leads: ,Organisation: UK Health Security Agency Project #101: Explaining the differential severity of COVID-19 between Indians in India and the UKType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a viral infection; while many people experience mild symptom and recover quickly, others go on to develop severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) resulting in hospitalization or death. Many study have shown that severe COVID-19 is more common in people who are older, overweight, or with existing health conditions. In country such a the UK and USA, COVID-19 ha had a greater impact on ethnic minority populations, including those of Indian ethnicity.At the start of the pandemic, India ha the lowest number of COVID-19 death worldwide, leading to the belief that severe COVID-19 may be le common in people residing in India than in Indian people in other countries. There are several plausible explanation for this; Firstly, people residing in India may have greater environmental exposure to sunlight than Indians residing in other countries, which may result in higher level of vitamin D. Secondly, people living in India may have greater immunity to COVID-19 resulting from greater exposure to other infections. This is related to socioeconomic status a people living in overcrowded household with poor sanitation may be more likely to contract infection than Indian population overseas. Thirdly, people residing in India may also be le obese and have fewer pre-existing condition than Indian people living in higher-income countries. Lower BMI in Indian resident may result from lower calorie intake or higher physical activity - both of which may lower the risk of severe COVID-19.Since 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic ha significantly worsened in India, and the comparison between Indian people residing in India vs. overseas ha reversed. While it is possible that real biological difference may explain the initial lower risk of severe COVID-19 in Indian residents, there may be alternative explanation such a difference in the quality of COVID-19 data and age structure of the populations. For example, people living in India may be le likely to visit the hospital with COVID-19 due to stigma around the virus, or they may be more likely to die at home instead of in a medical facility. This mean that the cause of death may be le well captured in India than in other countries, and the true number of people with severe COVID-19 may be underestimated. To date, no study ha fully answered whether the severity of COVID-19 truly differs between Indian population in India and in other countries.In this study, we will compare the risk of severe COVID-19 between Indians in the UK and India and identify possible explanations. We use the anonymised medical record of Indians in the UK and interview data from 220,000 people living in urban and rural India. We will first compare the proportion of the population who have ever had severe COVID-19, defined a either going to the hospital for or dying from COVID-19.We will then explore whether difference in the prevalence of severe COVID-19 can be explained by difference in data quality, the age structure of the two populations, or difference in the prevalence of key risk factors.We expect that the impact of our research will include the development of COVID- 19 prevention and management strategy which take into account the specific need of Indian population worldwide, and a deeper understanding of factor which lead to the the development of severe COVID-19 in people of Indian origin.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #100: Management of Early Inflammatory Arthritis during the COVID-19 PandemicType: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareRationaleThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is the biggest challenge the National Health Service (NHS) ha faced in living memory. For rheumatology services, the impact of the pandemic ha been enormous, with appointment delayed, consultation shifted to telephone, and procedure cancelled. Variation across the country is inevitable and we have an opportunity to learn from each other.The COVID-19 pandemic offer a unique opportunity to change the way we measure care quality in the NHS, reducing data burden and improving completeness. Care quality for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) service is currently assessed by the Health Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) National Early Inflammatory Arthritis Audit (NEIAA). The audit collect information across the first 12 month after diagnosis capturing performance against the NICE quality guidelines. However, data collection is burdensome for Trusts, often incomplete, and wa paused during the COVID-19 pandemic.Aim and MethodsOur goal is to use routinely collected data from electronic medical record through OpenSAFELY to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of service to patient with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis, identifying variation in care and in the speed of recovery across England.We will describe: i) delay in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis; ii) delay in the shared prescribing of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with primary care; and iii) delay in escalating treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. We will analyse this data using an interrupted time-series model, which allows u to compare pre-COVID-19 and post COVID-19 period from March 2020, with the post COVID-19 period further split at the start of subsequent pandemic waves.Expected output of projectWe anticipate that the output of this project will contribute to a reduction in variation in care across NHS service providers. In the long term, this research will set a precedent for the monitoring of early rheumatoid arthritis care to be undertaken using routine captured data, reducing the burden of clinician level data entry for every patient seen.Study lead: Organisation: King's College London Project #99: Suicide death after healthcare contact in primary careType: AuditTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID], Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcarePrevention of suicide death is a national priority for NHS England and Improvement. Analysing data on suicide death to understand what contact with healthcare took place in the day before they completed suicide will help u find opportunity to improve suicide prevention. Around a quarter of people who die by suicide are known to specialist mental health services, but many others may have been in contact with their GP or other primary care services.Studies show that survivor of COVID-19 infection are at increased risk of developing mental health disorders, but additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic ha led to change to daily living and social restrictions, contributing to decline in mental health and well-being of the general population. COVID-19 also affected how people accessed healthcare.This analysis is part of wider analysis on suicide death following contact with healthcare services, which will help to shape future suicide prevention improvement programmes. OpenSafely data will be used to examine suicide death following contact with GP or primary care service at a national level.Study lead: Organisation: NHS England and NHS Improvement Project #97: Primary Care Covid Codes StudyType: AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareBackgroundPrimary care record offer an opportunity to ascertain case of COVID-19 which do not necessarily result in hospital admission or death. This could be useful for studying the burden of COVID-19 in the community, risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection separately to risk of severe COVID-19, risk factor for mortality and case fatality ratio among those infected, and post-viral effect in people who had COVID-19 that did not require hospitalisation.There are over 100 primary care (CTV3) code with term related to COVID-19 used by TPP and available for selection in study performed in the OpenSAFELY platform (. The majority of these code have been newly created for use in the current pandemic. The aim of this work wa to assign these code into category related to the identification of COVID-19 in primary care, and to provide advice for study using the OpenSAFELY platform that require people to be classified by their COVID-19 case status a defined in primary care record (either a an exposure or a an outcome).MethodsAn initial list of TPP primary care code related to COVID-19 wa obtained by searching the TPP database for term containing COV-2, Coronavirus, or COVID. The returned term were cross-checked against the NHS Digital COVID-19 SNOMED CT code and CTV3 code for any missing term which were added to the list when found. The resulting list of term wa then reviewed by a team of clinicians, epidemiologist and statistician in order to identify distinct category of term and assign term into one of these distinct categories.An initial analysis of (probable case and suspected case) sub-categories wa then performed by plotting the following using OpenSAFELY data from between February 2020 - November 2021 (1) the frequency of code entered into TPP software by GPs over time and (2) the proportion of people dying due to (a) COVID-19 and (b) cause other than COVID-19 (using ONS cause of death data) in the 80 day after a record of a positive test in either primary care TPP data or in SGSS data.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #96: Covid-19 related death over timeType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]This study set out to describe subgroup difference in COVID-19 related death rate over time (February 2020 - December 2021) and describe COVID-19 related death risk in different subgroup of the population in the three pandemic waves. Subgroups are based on age category, sex, body mass index category, ethnicity, deprivation and comorbidities.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #95: COVID-19 CollateralType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThis study will investigate the negative impact of the pandemic on a range mental and physical health condition not directly related to coronavirus and identify how these impact differ by ethnicity, and socio-economic status. Understanding these negative impact will inform future healthcare policy by identifying population group at high risk and identifying health condition most negatively affected by the social restriction and healthcare burden caused by the pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic ha caused substantial illness and death, with the impact most serious for older adults, ethnic minority groups, and socially deprived populations. In addition to illness and death caused by COVID-19 itself, the pandemic ha had effect on wider mental and physical health. Reasons for this include reduced resource for the prevention, monitoring and treatment of illness un-related to COVID-19, and individual concern around fear of exposure to the virus and burdening of already stretched health care systems. Mental health and wellbeing may be negatively affected by anxiety related to social-isolation, limit on household and social mixing, loss of employment or income, and increased burden of childcare.This study will compare clinical monitoring, hospital admission and death for diabetes, lung disease, heart disease, and mental health between the UK, Denmark, and Sweden. The study will explore 1) whether these adverse outcome differ by ethnicity, and social-deprivation, and 2) whether risk have changed over time a population restriction have been introduced and lifted. Comparisons between country will help determine whether certain public health approach are associated with better health outcomes.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #94: PostOpCovidType: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID], Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcarePeople need to attend hospital for investigation and procedure to diagnose and treat illnesses. There is evidence that fear of COVID-19 kept them away in the pandemic, and that hospital acquired COVID-19 occurred and adversely affected some patient who attended. Patients need to know that they can come to hospital safely, and patient and doctor need to understand the risk and impact of acquiring COVID-19 and which factor make it post-operative outcome worse. Then safe policy can be implemented and monitored, and patient better informed of the risk and benefit of attending hospital for routine care.Within our hospital we use routinely collected data to measure these risk and monitor impact of policy changes. However, data in a single trust cannot provide the power to fully characterise the risk pertaining to different patient and procedures. This proposal using national health data will provide more precise, generalisable, repeatable risk estimate appropriately adjusted for difference between patient and procedures. We will use the OpenSAFELY Trusted Research Environment to provide hospital data on procedure and investigations, readmissions, and critical care admission from secondary care data, deaths, COVID-19 vaccination and testing data, and primary care diagnosis and prescription to incorporate pre-existing patient factor and the varying community level of COVID-19 infections.This work will provide reusable tool in real-world data for patient attending hospital for care; identifying high risk patient that might need pathway improvement and low risk patient and proceduresStudy lead: Organisation: University of Nottingham Project #93: Lockdowns and vulnerable groupsType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThe Covid-19 restriction and lockdown in England had a dramatic effect on the way people use health services. These effect may have been more pronounced for vulnerable groups, such a people exposed to domestic violence, people with mental health or addiction problems, or child with safeguarding concerns. We aim to analyse the frequency of GP visit over the period before, during and after the lockdown to see how health care access changed for vulnerable group and how that compare to the rest of the population. This will help u understand who experienced barrier to GP health care through the pandemic, if those barrier persisted after the lockdown and how we can improve them.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Bristol Project #92: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on service for people with asthmaType: Service evaluation / AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareGeneral practice ha been disrupted by the pandemic in many clinical areas, including in the delivery of asthma related care. We aim to ass how the COVID-19 pandemic ha impacted the delivery of service for people with asthma and their care. The first step will be to ascertain people with asthma in the electronic health record in the OpenSAFELY platform. Then we will analyse the diagnoses, tests, and how the patient care and condition were managed, with reference to national standard of care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will look to ass the impact of the pandemic on different group for example those in certain regions, ethnicity or deprivation groups. Our analysis will help inform the NHS recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, in various ways, such a identifying best practice others can learn from and prioritising high value care activities.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #91: Coverage, effectiveness and safety of neutralising monoclonal antibody or antiviral for non-hospitalised patient with COVID-19Type: Research / Service evaluationTopic areas: COVID vaccine eligibility/coverage, COVID vaccine effectiveness/safetyWhile vaccine remain the best strategy to prevent COVID-19, recent evidence suggests monoclonal antibody (nMABs) or antiviral could potentially benefit certain vulnerable population before or after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, such a the unvaccinated or recently vaccinated high-risk patients.With the recent roll out of nMABs and antivirals, there is an urgent need to for knowledge and understanding around the use of nMABs and antiviral in the treatment of patient with COVID-19, such a factor of relevance in determining nMAB and antiviral treatment and the impact of nMAB and antiviral treatment in real word settings.This project will cover three main area relating to the roll out of nMABs and antiviral for non-hospitalised patient with COVID-19; (1) eligibility and uptake, (2) effectiveness and (3) safety.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #89: Has COVID-19 Disrupted Chronic Pain Management in England?Type: Research / Service EvaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcarePain management is one of the central element of primary healthcare. Prior research suggests that between one third and one half of all UK adult may be suffering from noncancer-related painful condition that last more than three month (i.e., chronic pain). The high prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and associated cost of around 12billion per year to the UK economy warrant a closer look at the impact of COVID-19 on CP management. Longitudinal data from March 2019 to March 2022 are analysed to determine if patient who were treated for CP in March 2020 experienced change in long-term prescribing (4 or more within 12 months) for controlled analgesics, a shift to stronger/weaker pain medication, a well a treatment for dug dependence or misuse management in acute hospital settings. CP patient are a potentially vulnerable group and it is important to understand if and how the COVID-19 pandemic ha disrupted pain management.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #88: Impact of reduced kidney function, dialysis and transplantation on vaccination efficacy against COVID19Type: Audit / Service EvaluationTopic areas: COVID transmission/prevalence/non-pharmaceutical prevention, Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death], COVID vaccine effectiveness/safetyA previous analysis of breakthrough infection ha found that people on renal replacement therapy (dialysis and transplantation) appear to be more susceptible to breakthrough infection with COVID19 even if they were previously vaccinated.The aim of this project is to use combined data on kidney function and the requirement of renal replacement therapy from both primary care and UK Renal Registry data a well a hospital code to quantify how impaired kidney function and modality of renal replacement therapy modify the risk of breakthrough infection after vaccination.We will also quantify the protective impact using third a well a booster-vaccinations compared to not having received booster vaccines.The output will be a research paper and inform national vaccination policy.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and UK Kidney Association Project #87: Validation of the OpenSAFELY kidney codesType: AuditTopic areas: COVID transmission/prevalence/non-pharmaceutical prevention, Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death], Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID], COVID vaccine eligibility/coverage, COVID vaccine effectiveness/safetyWe aim to ensure that the most accurate data are used to identify people with advanced kidney disease and those who are undergoing kidney replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation). This is important a for example people with dialysis may have different risk of COVID19 compared to people who have advanced kidney disease but not yet started dialysis, even if both group have been already vaccinated. Current data held by GPs will have inaccuracy a GPs may only know about dialysis start in a patient after some delay (in receiving letters), and not all hospital code dialysis a a hospitalisation, therefore existing data held in OpenSAFELY may be inaccurate.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and UK Kidney Association Project #86: Understanding the impact of healthcare disruption on avoidable hospitalisationsType: AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThe COVID-19 pandemic ha placed large pressure on the NHS. To help make space to treat patient with COVID-19, the NHS ha cancelled, postponed, or changed health care. Some people were discouraged from using service for fear of catching COVID-19 or not wanting to take up resource during a pandemic.We will study the impact of health care disruption (e.g., delay and confusion over service delivery) in England. We will study how hospital admission that could have been prevented have varied during the pandemic. We will look at trend over time, including which type of people were more affected than others. We will share the finding with policy makers, NHS care managers, and politician to help inform:Which service to invest in or prioritise firstWhich type of people need additional helpOur study will help benefit patient and minimise any impact of this disruption.Study lead: Organisation: University of Liverpool Project #85: FLUCATSType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]The use of triage tool during surge and mass casualty event is recommended in national guidance. The need for such tool wa identified again in preparation for the recent Olympic and Paralympic Games.The evidence base for this guidance wa challenged by GPs at the RCGP Pandemic Flu Summit in March 2010. GPs questioned the extent to which they a a group had been involved in the development of the tools. GPs were also concerned that there is little data supporting use of such tool in primary care.This study aim to validate a previously developed triage tool (for pandemic influenza) called FLUCATs () on patient with COVID-19 . This study will test how well the FLUCATs test how part of a general practitioner question and assessment of child and adult with COVID-19 like illness can predict who: can safely be kept at home; need hospital admission; need high dependency or intensive care; are most at-risk of dying.Study lead: Organisation: University of Liverpool Project #84: Fit note in primary care post-COVIDType: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]Fit note (sometimes called sick notes) are issued by GPs in the UK where a person need to demonstrate to their employer that they are unable to work for health reason for more than 7 days. Given the large number of patient living after being diagnosed with COVID-19, it is important to know the degree to which recovering from COVID affect people ability to work. Coding of fit note by GPs should provide a window on the scale of the continuing public health and economic burden for those recovering from COVID-19. This in turn can assist policy maker in prioritising resource for COVID recovery services.In parallel with this, measuring the diagnosis that are associated with fit note coding would provide important insight into the type of condition that are causing substantial continued problem for people recovering from COVID-19. This could provide important information for the continued care of these patients.This study examines to what extent (rate and duration) fit note are given to patient with COVID (identified through three routesthose testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, those with a probably diagnostic code in primary care, and those hospitalised with a diagnostic code for COVID) and compare against general population from 2019 and 2020, a well a an active comparator (patients hospitalised with pneumonia in 2019 for comparison with hospitalised COVID patients). It also evaluates what diagnosis are commonly coded alongside the recording of a fit note. The study also analysis what type of patient get a fit note, according to demographic, clinical, and organisational factors.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #82: Spatiotemporal risk of infection of care home during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UKType: ResearchTopic areas: COVID transmission/prevalence/non-pharmaceutical preventionCare home resident have restricted mixing with the general population but staff provide a route of infection introduction from the surrounding community. The aim of this analysis wa to investigate the timing of first evidence of introduction of COVID-19 to care home across England, to understand care home characteristic associated with earlier introduction and the relationship between risk of introduction and the surrounding local epidemic.A rolling analysis over time wa planned with the primary outcome being occurrence of a covid-related event (test positive, clinical diagnosis, admission or death) among resident of a care home within the next 14 day from the current time step. Explanatory factor for 14-day risk considered were care home size, whether residential/nursing, proportion of resident with dementia, deprivation index and rural/urban classification of the home postcode, and daily incidence of probable COVID-19 infection within the local population of the home Middle Super Output Area (MSOA).The analysis wa ultimately retired due to complication with identifying individual residing in the same household and defining whether or not each household wa a care home or private home.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #81: Analysis of the relative severity of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant compared to the Alpha variantType: ResearchTopic areas: COVID transmission/prevalence/non-pharmaceutical preventionThe SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant first emerged in India in late 2020. The Delta variant became the dominant circulating form of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK by summer 2021.This study considered the feasibility of an analysis to estimate the relative severity of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant compared to the previously circulating form of the virus.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #80: Analysis of the relative severity of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant compared to wild type virusType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: The SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant wa first identified in Kent, UK in autumn 2020. The variant wa more transmissible than the prevalent wild type virus and quickly became the dominant circulating form of the virus.This study aimed to estimate the relative severity of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant compared to the previously circulating wild type virus.The study population wa defined by all people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the window 16th November 2020 to 11th January 2021, with data available on the gene marker that can differentiate between the two virus type (SGTF).The exposure of interest wa infection with the Alpha variant. The outcome of interest were hospital admission, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and all-cause mortality.The key finding of this research is that infection with the Alpha variant is associated with a 70% increased risk of all-cause death compared to wild type virus.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #79: Viral competition and non-specific immunity between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 respiratory diseasesType: ResearchTopic areas: COVID transmission/prevalence/non-pharmaceutical preventionThere is some thought that virus that cause respiratory illness may compete with one another so that only one can become established in the host at a time. Further, it may be possible that respiratory illness other than COVID-19 may induce some immune protection against COVID-19.This study aimed to estimate the impact of non-COVID-19 respiratory infection on the incidence of COVID-19 infection and it severity among the general population.The exposure of interest wa infection with non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. The outcome of interest were infection with COVID-19 and the resulting outcome of COVID-19 infection.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #78: Long-term kidney outcome after COVID-19Type: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]GitHub: Around a third of people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 develop kidney damage (known a acute kidney injury or AKI). While AKI is often recoverable, it can sometimes lead to worsening of long-term kidney function and in some cases, permanent kidney failure requiring long-term dialysis or a kidney transplant. The complication caused by long-term kidney damage exert considerable stress on the NHS and it is important that we know what to expect to be able to ensure that service are planned with sufficient capacity to cope. For example, growing number of people requiring dialysis will require investment in the workforce and infrastructure. We plan to investigate what happens to long-term kidney function after COVID-19 using electronically coded GP record combined with hospital record routinely-collected from day-to-day patient care inEngland.Our study will include adult without kidney failure to begin with (i.e. those not on dialysis or a kidney transplant). We will compare people with and without COVID-19 for difference in the rate of the following kidney outcomes:Newly-diagnosed kidney failure,50% or more reduction in kidney function from before,Further AKI.We will be able to determine whether outcome vary based on the severity of COVID-19, based on time (e.g. during peaks, after widespread use of effective anti-COVID-19 drug such a steroids), and based on level of vaccination. We will account for factor such a age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, BMI, and pre-existing medical problem such a diabetes.As kidney failure is relatively rare in the general population, very large study are needed to be able to investigate whether or not a group is at increased risk compared to other groups. Because of the size of the population in OpenSAFELY, we will be uniquely placed to be able to detect difference in this outcome due to COVID-19.Study leads: ,,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #77: Investigating the impact of COVID-19 on childhood immunisation - prototyping a dashboardThe pandemic put pressure on routine healthcare service such a family practices, who are usually responsible for giving a range of childhood vaccines, up to the age when child start school. We set out to investigate the impact of the pandemic on childhood immunisations, for example to explore whether they were more likely to be given later or missed altogether. We aimed to produce a prototype of a dashboard which would show, nationally and at local levels, the impact of the pandemic on childhood immunisation rate and any catch-up action which may be required.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #76: Serious outcome after COVID hospitalisationType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: Patients with COVID-19 are thought to be at higher risk of cardiometabolic and pulmonary complications, but quantification of that risk is limited. We aimed to describe the overall burden of these complication in survivor of severe COVID-19.Working on behalf of NHS England, we used linked primary care records, death certificate and hospital data from the OpenSAFELY platform. We constructed three cohorts: patient discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, patient discharged following hospitalisation with pneumonia in 2019, and a frequency-matched cohort from the general population in 2019. We studied eight cardiometabolic and pulmonary outcomes. Absolute rate were measured in each cohort and Cox regression model were fitted to estimate age/sex adjusted hazard ratio comparing outcome rate between discharged COVID-19 patient and the two comparator cohorts.Cardiometabolic and pulmonary adverse outcome were markedly raised following hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared to the general population. However, the excess risk were more comparable to those seen following hospitalisation with pneumonia. Identifying patient at particularly high risk of outcome would inform targeted preventive measures.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #75: Long-COVID: symptoms, diagnosis and prescription recorded in electronic health record after COVID-19Type: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impactsSome people who have had COVID-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus responsible for the 2020 pandemic) complain of ongoing symptoms, sometimes for many months, after they recover from their initial infection. While we know that ongoing post-COVID-19 symptom occur, we do not yet know how often this happens, or the full spectrum of possible symptoms. We want to know whether doctor decide that the symptom are due to COVID-19 or another disease. We would like to find out which, if, any, symptom resolve over time and how quickly or slowly this happens. Finally, we also do not know whether there are any factor that can predict which group of people are more likely to have continuing symptom after they have COVID-19, specifically in relation to age, sex and vaccination status.It is vital that we know the answer to these question so that we are better able to support those struggling with ongoing symptom and plan the health service they need.Therefore, we plan to investigate these question using routinely recorded health information from very large number of the UK general population. This routine healthcare information is recorded every time someone ha any sort of contact with a general practitioner or a hospital, making it a large and powerful source of information for answering these questions. We access this information in a very safe way to ensure that we never see any individual health records, we only ever see the result of our study in groups.Study leads: ,Organisation: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #74: Investigating the effect of SGLT2is on COVID-19 outcomesType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]This study is investigating the use of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2is) on the risk of COVID-19 outcome in the general population.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #73: Exploring quality and completeness of ethnicity recording in TPP, EMIS and linked data sourcesType: Audit (Postponed)Topic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareTo describe quality annd completeness of ethnicity recording in TPP, EMIS linked data source and validate against 2021 Census ethnicity from ONS.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #72: Post COVID Type 1 DiabetesType: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]This study aimed to look at whether COVID-19 increase the risk of incident type 1 diabetes in child and adults.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #71: OpenPROMPTType: Research (Onoging)Topic areas: Long COVIDWe want to understand the impact of long COVID on the quality-of-life of people who have developed this condition. For many health conditions, researcher ask people to fill in standardised survey which measure quality-of-life, which help them understand how much the condition is affecting people. These kind of measure are used in planning the resource for health systems, because they allow a standard way of comparing different health conditions, and, if people fill them in repeatedly, tracking change in wellbeing over time.These quality-of-life measurement are not currently available for people with long COVID who did not need to be hospitalised during their COVID-19 episode. Our study aim to collect these measurements, by using a smartphone app linked to a patient GP records. We will ask people to voluntarily participate in the study and use the app, and if they do so to give their consent for filling the questionnaire and for linkage to their health records.These result will tell u if long COVID ha different quality-of-life impact among different age groups, ethnicities, geographic regions, or because of any underlying health conditions.We will convert the result into standardised measurement that are used in the NHS to ass the impact of illnesses. This mean they will be useful for working out how much the effect of long COVID cost the health service, and how we should prioritise intervention such a booster vaccine to avoid more people getting long COVID.Together with other researcher studying long COVID we will provide result to support long-term care. At all stage we will work with people affected by long COVID to ensure their input is central to designing the study plan and interpreting the outputs.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #70: Lone household and mental health outcomesType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareLoneliness and living alone have been linked with poor mental and physical health. Evidence suggests that the COVID pandemic exacerbated feeling of loneliness, social isolation and connectivity, due to national lockdowns, social distancing rule and shielding. There is also evidence that the pandemic increased psychological distress including feeling of anxiety and depression, and perhaps particularly for those living alone.This study will use a large cohort of adult to see how diagnosis of mental health condition changed before and during the COVID pandemic, and how this differed among people living alone and not living alone.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #69: Monitoring safety and adverse event in coronavirus vaccine trialsType: ResearchTopic areas: COVID-19 vaccine safetyTo provide background rate of adverse event in population similar to those recruited in COVID-19 vaccine trials.

The COVID-19 pandemic ha been shown to have caused significant disruption to healthcare services. This study examines the rate of hazardous prescribing or delayed monitoring a indicated by each individual PINCER indicator between September 2019 and September 2021 to ass the impact of the pandemic.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #65: Describing trend and variation in HbA1c level during COVID-19 in 24 million patients' primary care record using OpenSAFELYType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThe HbA1c test, used to measure blood glucose level, is a key primary care service that ha been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Getting an accurate read of blood glucose level is necessary to make new diabetes diagnosis and detect increased risk of complication for existing diabetics. Furthermore, diabetes ha been linked to greater COVID-19 severity and mortality, making regular monitoring and management of blood glucose level more crucial.This study aim to describe the impact of service disruption on HbA1c test result across 23.8 million patient record in England. It present cohort-based observational analysis to examine metric such a the number of HbA1c test recorded, percentage of abnormal results, and mean of test value between January 2019 and June 2021, focusing on breakdown by healthcare inequalities, which include age group, sex, ethnicity, region, IMD, diabetes, learning disability, and mental health conditions.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #64: Short-term safety of COVID-19 vaccine in England 2020/21 - acute venous thromboembolic eventsType: ResearchTopic areas: COVID-19 vaccine safety (venous thromboembolic events)Safe and effective vaccination is vital for the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted rapid vaccine development and roll-out. Each vaccine demonstrated a reassuring safety profile in large clinical trial before licensing for use. However, post-licensing vaccine safety surveillance remains important for vaccine safety and public confidence. On March 11 2021, the Danish authority temporarily paused delivery of COVID-19 vaccination while investigating a report of a fatal blood clot in a person who had received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 adenovirus vector vaccine. A new syndrome of thrombosis with thrombocytopaenia ha been described, prompting further investigation of venous thromboembolism event following vaccination.This study aim to investigate the association of each of Pfizer BioNTech and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine with any venous thromboembolism (VTE) in England. The study will also look at the specific outcome of pulmonary embolism and cerebral venous thrombosis.Primary analysis will use a self-controlled case series (SCCS) design, a case-only design which compare incidence of event within the same individual across different time periods. A separate analysis will be conducted for each vaccine brand. Vaccination status will be obtained from the primary care record. We will use primary care and hospital admission record to define episode of venous thromboembolism.A secondary objective is to investigate the extent to which self-controlled case series (SCCS) and cohort study design differ in their estimation of any association of COVID-19 vaccination with venous thromboembolic events, to aid interpretation of finding from other observational vaccine safety studies. A secondary analysis will use a cohort study design with both historical and concurrent comparator groups. A cohort study design can be a useful complement to investigate the robustness of finding from SCCS analysis in safety studies, since they have a different profile of biases. We will use this analysis to explore the effect of study design on estimate of vaccine safety.This study is a partnership between the OpenSAFELY collaboration, the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Vaccines and Immunisation (a partnership between the London School of Hygiene and the UK Health Security Agency), the NIHR HPRU in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections at University of Liverpool, and the Medicines and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency (MHRA).Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #63: Short-term safety of COVID-19 vaccine in England 2020/21 - neurological eventsType: ResearchTopic areas: COVID-19 vaccine safety (neurological events)Safe and effective vaccination is vital for the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted rapid vaccine development and roll-out. Each vaccine demonstrated a reassuring safety profile in large clinical trial before licensing for use. However, post-licensing vaccine safety surveillance remains important for vaccine safety and public confidence. This study aim to investigate for any association of COVID-19 vaccination with each of Guillain-Barr syndrome, transverse myelitis and Bells palsy.Primary analysis will use a self-controlled case series (SCCS) design, a case-only design which compare incidence of event within the same individual across different time periods. A separate analysis will be conducted for each combination of vaccine brand and outcome. Vaccination status will be obtained from the primary care record. We will use primary care and hospital admission record to define episode of Guillain-Barr syndrome, transverse myelitis and Bells palsy, and will additionally use emergency care attendance data to enhance ascertainment of Bells palsy.We also plan to follow with a secondary analysis using a cohort study design with both historical and concurrent comparator groups. A cohort study design can be a useful complement to investigate the robustness of finding from SCCS analysis in safety studies, since they have a different profile of biases.

However, there have been no randomised controlled trial that have made direct head-to-head comparisons. Such comparison are difficult in observational data without the rollout of both vaccine across the same population at the same time. The concurrent rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in health and social care worker in England provides a rare opportunity to do this.We compared effectiveness in around million health and social care worker in England, vaccinated between 4 January and 28 February 2021, and followed up for 20 weeks. Primary outcome were recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related accident and emergency attendance, and COVID-19-related hospital admission.We found very little difference in between the vaccine on the studied outcomes. Whilst some material difference in the protective effect may exist, both are extremely effective for reducing COVID-19 disease and there were too few event to reliably detect such difference up to 20 week after vaccination.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #61: Estimating COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in early recipient of the vaccine under the UK national vaccination programmeType: ResearchTopic areas: COVID vaccine effectiveness/safetyThe COVID-19 vaccine were developed and rigorously evaluated in randomized trial within a year of the first report of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. However, many question about vaccine effectiveness were not answered by randomized trials, for example protection for sick or elderly people, or against severe outcome such a hospitalisation. The UK started it general population COVID-19 vaccination programme in early December 2020, prioritising vaccination in the most vulnerable people, in particular elderly people, who were not well-represented in trials.We assessed vaccine effectiveness amongst >2.6 million people aged over 70 in England, using linked routine clinical data from the OpenSAFELY TPP database. We looked at the vaccine ability to reduce infection, hospitalisation, and death compared with those who were not vaccinated. We studied both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.We found that the vaccine were highly effective. However, we also found evidence of bias in these estimates. For example, the estimated protective effect of vaccination wa very high in the first two week after vaccination, yet we know from trial that immunity doe not develop until after the first week.We discus the challenge of estimated vaccine effectiveness in observational data, using our study a an exemplar.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #60: Describing the rate of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough in fully vaccinated individual in EnglandType: ResearchTopic areas: COVID vaccine effectiveness/safetyGitHub: The vaccination programme for COVID-19 in the UK started on 8th December 2020. As with any vaccine, despite being vaccinated, COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough is likely and a small number of people will still fall ill, be hospitalised, or die from COVID-19.As of 30th June 2021, a total of 10,782,870 individual were identified a being fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with a median follow-up time of 43 day (IQR: 23-64). From within this population, the total number of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough case wa 17,030 (0.2%). The majority of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough case were mild with relatively few fully vaccinated individual being hospitalised or dying a a result. However, some concerning difference in rate of breakthrough case were identified in several clinical groups; comorbidities with the highest rate of breakthrough COVID-19 included renal replacement therapy, organ transplant, haematological malignancy, and immunocompromisedThe continued increase in number of positive SARS-CoV-2 test in England are concerning and, a number of fully vaccinated individual increase and follow-up time lengthens, so too will the number of COVID-19 breakthrough cases.To help inform roll-out of the third and booster dose vaccination, and to support the redesignation of dialysis patient into the 3rd dose group, with eligibility for subsequent vaccination, this analysis wa rerun in November 2021 (with the previous CKD group split out into categories). As expected, there had been a rise in all rate (calculated per 1000 person-years);Positive SARS-CoV-2 test from 12.33 (12.14-12.51) to 99.44 (99.31-99.57)COVID related hospitalisation from 0.70 (0.65-0.74) to 2.31 (2.29-2.34)COVID related death from 0.12 (0.1-0.14) to 0.64 (0.63-0.66)Despite these increases, reassuringly, breakthrough case remain relatively mild; 312, 530 Positive SARS-CoV-2 test v 3840 COVID-19 related death (with the majority (80%) of death occurring in those over 70 year of age).Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #59: Care home excess mortalityType: ResearchTopic areas: Excess mortality in Care HomesThis project wa initiated to quantify care home mortality on the care home level a so called excess mortality. After initial feasibility work, this wa paused due to the lack of a time-updated household identifier.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #58: Carehomes Short Data ReportType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: This short data report compared different strategy for identifying care home resident in electronic health record in England. Historically, GPs do not enter whether or not a person is living in a care home in their medical record. There is also no central registry of care home residents. Therefore, when we want to study people in care home using electronic health record from GP surgeries, we need to rely on other method to identify these people.In this report we compared using medical codes, an address linkage, and household information to identify care home residents. We describe how these method are implemented in OpenSAFELY, and compared the overlap between them.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #57: OpenSAFELY NHS Service Restoration Observatory: describing trend and variation in key measure of general practice clinical activity.Type: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThe COVID-19 pandemic ha had a significant impact on the delivery of care within the NHS. We have developed the OpenSAFELY Service Restoration Observatory to describe this impact on primary care activity and monitor the restoration of service. We produced 11 measure reflective of clinical activity in general practice. A substantial drop in activity wa observed in all measure at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. By April 2021, the median rate had recovered to within 15% of the median rate in April 2019. The remaining measure showed a sustained drop, ranging from a 18.5% reduction in medication review to a 42.0% reduction in blood pressure monitoring. Three measure continued to show a sustained drop by December 2021. Since December 2021 activity rate have recovered to (or in some case above) the pre-pandemic baseline for measure involving blood test including cholesterol, liver function, thyroid, full blood counts, HbA1c, and renal function testing a well a for medication review activity.Study leads: ,,,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #56: Mortality among Care Home Residents in EnglandType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: This study aimed to quantify the mortality risk among care home resident compared to resident of private home during the first and second wave of the pandemic. We used a technique called standardisation to account for age difference between care home resident and resident of private homes, and described how the mortality risk changed between February 2019 and March 2021.We found that care home resident had an approximately 10-fold higher risk of death compared to resident of private home prior to the first pandemic wave; this increased to an approximately 17 time higher risk during the first wave. Despite absolute increase in the risk of death during the second wave, the relative mortality risk for care home resident remained stable at approximately 10-fold higher compared to resident of private homes.These analysis were largely descriptive, and a such we cannot say why there wa a spike in the risk of death for care home resident during the first but not the second wave. Plausible explanation include improved protection in care home such a testing and better use of personal protective equipment (PPE), pre-existing immunity from the first wave among resident and staff, or an element of mortality displacement. The peak of the second wave occurred prior to the point where the UK vaccination program is anticipated to have an effect. This study quantifies the impact of the pandemic on care home resident in England, and suggests a number of important question for future research to ensure that this vulnerable population is protected for the next pandemic.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #55: Potentially inappropriate prescribing of DOACs to patient with a mechanical heart valve throughout the COVID-19 pandemicType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareGitHub: National guidance wa issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to switch patient on warfarin to direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) where appropriate a these require le frequent blood testing. DOACs are not recommended for patient with mechanical heart valves. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of DOAC prescribing in people with a record of a mechanical heart valve between September 2019 and May 2021, and describe the characteristic of this population. We identified 15,457 individual with a mechanical heart valve recorded in their records, of whom 1058 (6.8%) had been prescribed a DOAC during the study period. 767 individual with a record of a mechanical heart valve were currently prescribed a DOAC a of May 31st 2021.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #54: Association between living with child and outcome from COVID-19: an update of an OpenSAFELY cohort study in EnglandType: Audit / ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]COVID-19 disease in child and young people is typically mild or asymptomatic, however the role of child and young people in transmission of SARs-CoV-2 remains unclear. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, school were shut, on the premise that child may be vector of COVID-19, a they are for other respiratory diseases, such a seasonal influenza. Evidence on the absolute impact of educational setting being closed on community transmission is mixed; quantifying the impact is challenging, a closure have been implemented alongside other public health measures, infection control measure vary across educational setting and school opening may be associated with other behavioural changes. The negative impact of school closure on the educational, developmental and mental health of child is undisputed.In our previous analysis we showed during the first wave of the UK pandemic, when school were largely closed, for adult 65 year and under living with child there wa no evidence of a markedly increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, during wave 2 (1st September to 19th December 2020) when school were largely open, there wa evidence of increased risk of infection and hospitalisation with COVID-19, although the risk of death from COVID-19 wa not increased in either wave.In this analysis, we examine the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcome from COVID-19 associated with living with child compared to those without during 2021, and the impact that adult vaccination had on that risk.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #53: Short report for JCVIType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: This wa an early look at work which wa later written up for publication (see Risks of COVID-19 hospital admission and death for people with learning disability - a cohort study.)Two cohort were assembled, reflecting the two first wave of COVID-19 experienced in the UK, comprising male and female aged up to 105 years: (1) wave 1, from 1st March 2020 until 31st August 2020; (2) wave 2, 1st September 2020 until 31st December 2020 (for admissions) or 8th February 2021 (for deaths). The main outcome were COVID-19 related death and COVID-19 related hospitalisation. Various risk factor were included, with particular focus on whether or not the person wa on the learning disability register.Generally, age wa the strongest factor associated with both outcomes, but much stronger for COVID-19 death than mortality. Various comorbidities were associated with increased absolute risks, aligning with the earlier work on risk factor (Nature, 2020). Learning disability wa noted a being associated with increased risk (leading to subsequent publication focused on that question).Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #52: Risks of COVID-19 hospital admission and death for people with learning disability - a cohort study.Type: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: This study aimed to ass the association between learning disability and risk of hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19 in England among adult and children.Two cohort were assembled, reflecting the two first wave of COVID-19 experienced in the UK, comprising male and female aged up to 105 years: (1) wave 1, from 1st March 2020 until 31st August 2020; (2) wave 2, 1st September 2020 until 31st December 2020 (for admissions) or 8th February 2021 (for deaths). The main exposure group wa people included on a general practice learning disability register (LDR), with a subgroup of people classified a having profound or severe learning disability. We also identified patient with Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. The main outcome were COVID-19 related death and COVID-19 related hospitalisation. Non-COVID-19 related death wa also explored.In wave 1, of 14,301,415 included individual aged 16 and over, 90,095 (0.63%) were identified a being on the LDR. 30,173 COVID-related hospital admissions, 13,919 COVID-19 related death and 69,803 non-COVID death occurred; of which 538 (1.8%), 221 (1.6%) and 596 (0.85%) were among individual on the LDR, respectively. Wave 1 hazard ratio for individual on the LDR, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity and geographical location, were 5.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.9, 5.8) for COVID-19 related hospital admission and 8.2 (95% CI: 7.1, 9.4) for COVID-19 related death. Wave 2 produced similar estimates.Associations were stronger among those classed a severe-profound and among those in residential care. Down syndrome and cerebral palsy were associated with increased hazard of both event in both waves; Down syndrome to a much greater extent. Hazards of non-COVID-19 related death followed similar pattern with weaker associations.People with learning disability have markedly increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19. This raised risk is over and above that seen for non-COVID cause of death. Ensuring prompt access to Covid-19 testing and health care and consideration of prioritisation for COVID-19 vaccination and other targeted preventive measure are warranted.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #51: Predicting risk of COVID-19 mortality: comparison of methodsType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]Obtaining accurate estimate of risk is challenging in the context of changing level of circulating infection, which standard risk prediction model commonly ignore.We adopt a landmarking approach for risk prediction to dynamically incorporate time- and region-dependent information on infection prevalence. We compare this approach with more commonly used Cox model that do not take infection prevalence into account, in term of discriminaton and calibration. We also compare simpler model to more richly specified ones.The target population wa adult registered at a general practice in England in March 2020. The outcome wa 28-day COVID-19-related-death. Predictors included demographic characteristic and comorbidities. Three proxy of local infection prevalence were used: model-based estimates; rate of COVID-19-related attendance in emergency care; and rate of suspected COVID-19 case in primary care.Prediction model were developed on 11,972,947 individuals, of whom 7,999 experienced COVID-19-related-death. All model discriminated well between individual who did and did not experience COVID-19 mortality, including simple model adjusting only for basic demographic and number of comorbidities: C-statistics 0.92-0.94. However, absolute risk estimate were substantially miscalibrated when infection prevalence wa not explicitly modelled.Our study suggests that model that ignore the infection prevalence provide poorly calibrated estimate of absolute risk; model that include time-varying measure of the infection prevalence can provide more accurate estimates. Simple model based only on number of comorbidities and basic demographic performed almost a well a more complex risk prediction models, both within model including infection prevalence and model that ignore this, suggesting that policy targeting population level reduction of COVID-19 mortality risk may not need to distinguish between all comorbidities in detail.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #50: Trends and clinical characteristic of COVID-19 vaccine recipientsType: Audit / ResearchTopic areas: COVID vaccine eligibility/coverageGitHub: The COVID-19 vaccination programme wa launched in England on 8th December 2020. Limited information wa available on vaccination coverage in detailed demographic and clinical subgroups.We deployed a data monitoring framework using publicly auditable method and a secure, in-situ processing model, using linked but pseudonymised patient-level NHS data on 57.9 million patients. We describe vaccine coverage and time trend across a range of subgroup of Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) priority cohorts.Our study highlight lower vaccination coverage among certain key groups: ethnic minorities, those living in area of higher deprivation, and individual living with severe mental illness or learning disabilities; where targeted activity may be needed to ensure equitable protection against COVID-19.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #49: Association between household composition and severe COVID-19 outcome in older people by ethnicity: an observational cohort study using the OpenSAFELY platformType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]Ethnic difference in the risk of severe COVID-19 may be linked to ethnic difference in household composition. In this study our aim wa to ass whether household composition (= the number of age-based generation in a household) wa associated with risk of severe COVID-19 for older individual (people aged 67 or older) after taking account of other risk factor for severe COVID-19, and whether this association differed by ethnicity.We created a cohort that included all people over the age of 67 in OpenSAFELY, and analysed whether the number of younger generation that the 67+ year old lived with wa associated with their risk of being hospitalised or dying from COVID-19. We performed separate analysis for wave 1 (01/02/2020-31/08/2020) and wave 2 (01/09/2020-31/01/2021) in the UK, and analysed the effect of the following living arrangements: 67+ year old living alone, 67+ year old living with other 67+ year olds, 67+ year old living with people from 1 younger generation, 67+ year old living with people from 2 younger generations, 67+ year old living with people from 3 younger generation (with distinct younger generation defined a 0-18, 18-29, 30-66). For all analyses, we assessed whether observed effect were different by ethnic group (defined a White, Black, South Asian, Mixed and Other).Initial result showed that in Wave 1 there wa no association between household composition and severe COVID-19 for any ethnicity, but that in wave 2 living with increasing number of younger generation wa associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 for White and for South Asian people. We also found that older South Asian people are over-represented within multi-generational household in the most deprived settings, and older people in these setting have a particularly high risk of severe COVID-19.Study leads: ,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #48: Recording of "COVID-19 vaccine declined" among vaccination priority groupsType: AuditTopic areas: COVID vaccine eligibility/coverageGitHub: All patient in England within vaccine priority group were offered a COVID-19 vaccine by mid-April 2021. Clinical record system contain code to denote when such an offer ha been declined by a patient (although these can in some case be entered for a variety of other reason including vaccination delay, or other administrative issues). We set out to describe the pattern of usage of code for COVID-19 vaccine being declined.We identified all patient in key vaccine priority groups: aged over 50, or over 16 and at increased risk from COVID-19 (Clinically Extremely Vulnerable [CEV] or otherwise at risk). We describe the proportion of patient recorded a declining a COVID-19 vaccination for each priority group, and by other clinical and demographic factors; whether patient recorded a declined subsequently went on to receive a vaccination; and the distribution of code usage across GP practices.We found that clinical code indicative of COVID-19 vaccination being declined are widely used in English general practice. Of 24.5 million patient in priority group a of May 25th 2021, 89.2% had received a vaccine, 8.8% had neither a vaccination nor a decline recorded, and 2.7% had a decline code recorded. Of patient with a recorded decline, 18.9% were subsequently vaccinated.Declines were substantially more commonly recorded among Black and South Asian patients, and patient from more deprived areas. There is a need for more detailed survey and/or qualitative research with patient and clinician to determine the most common reason for these recorded declines.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #47: OpenSAFELY NHS Service Restoration Observatory 1: describing trend and variation in primary care clinical activity for 23.3 million patient in England during the first wave of COVID-19Type: AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareGitHub: The COVID-19 pandemic ha disrupted healthcare activity. The NHS stopped non-urgent work in March 2020, later recommending service be restored to near-normal level before winter where possible.We aimed to describe the volume and variation of coded clinical activity in general practice across the whole population in OpenSAFELY-TPP between January 2019-September 2020, taking respiratory disease and laboratory procedure a examples.We found that activity recorded in general practice declined during the pandemic, but largely recovered by September 2020. There wa a large drop in coded activity for laboratory tests, with broad recovery to pre-pandemic level by September. One exception wa International Normalised Ratio test, with a smaller reduction. The pattern of recording for respiratory symptom wa le affected, following an expected seasonal pattern and classified a no change. Respiratory infection exhibited a sustained drop not returning to pre-pandemic level by September. Asthma review experienced a small drop but recovered, while COPD review remained below baseline.In conclusion: We delivered an open source software framework to describe trend and variation in clinical activity across an unprecedented scale of primary care data. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a substantial change in healthcare activity.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #46: OpenSAFELY: impact of national guidance on switching anticoagulant therapy during COVID-19 pandemicType: ResearchTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareGitHub: From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NHS recommended putting measure in place to reduce face-to-face contact with patient where possible to reduce the risk of transmission. This included guidance to consider switching warfarin patient to a direct acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) where suitable. This aimed to reduce the number of time patient had to attend for blood tests. However, it wa not known how widespread this practice was, whether it resulted in potentially dangerous co-administration of both drug in some patients, or whether those patient who remained on warfarin were tested frequently and maintained good clotting results.We identified patient who were taking warfarin prior to the pandemic and the factor associated with being switched to DOACs.This is the first widespread study on the impact of the NHS England guidance. We showed that a substantial number of patient in general practice in England had their anticoagulant switched from warfarin to a DOAC. We also showed that there wa a small number of patient who potentially received both warfarin and a DOAC. There did not appear to be a widespread reduction in INR control during the pandemic.This study highlight that national prescribing guidance can be implemented in primary care in England, both on a large scale and at a fast pace when necessary to improve patient care. It also highlight the importance of good clinical governance process when switching medications, in order to reduce the risk of co-prescribing of both agents.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #45: Overall and cause-specific hospitalisation and death after COVID-19 hospitalisation in England: cohort study in OpenSAFELY using linked primary care, secondary care and death registration dataType: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]There is concern about medium to long-term effect of COVID-19. The aim of this study wa to investigate whether people have a higher risk of hospital admission and death after being discharged from hospital following illness with COVID-19.We used anonymised electronic health record from English hospital to identify people who had been admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and then later discharged. We also gathered further detail about these individual from linked GP records. We then looked at whether these patient were re-admitted to hospital later, or died (using national death registration data). For comparison, we also used data from before the pandemic and looked at hospitalisation and death in people who had previously been in hospital with influenza, and in people who had not been in hospital at all.24,673 people who had been discharged from hospital following illness with COVID-19 were identified. These individual had higher risk of returning to hospital and dying compared with people who had never been in hospital. They also had higher risk of dying than people who had been in hospital with influenza prior to the pandemic, but similar risk of being readmitted to hospital.We concluded that the higher risk for rehospitalisation and death in people discharged after a COVID-19 hospital admission compared with the general population might create a substantial extra burden on healthcare.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #44: Pre-Covid: Anti-coagsType: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term)GitHub: (1) It wa reported that people with severe COVID-19 are at risk of blood clots. Warfarin is a commonly used blood thinning treatment. A previous study suggested that it might increase the risk of severe COVID-19 related outcome due to the process of how it produce an effect in the human body to prevent blood clots, which is different from it alternative treatment (direct oral anticoagulants, DOACs). However, little is known about the impact of routine use of warfarin on COVID-19 related blood clots.Therefore, we studied a large number of people with atrial fibrillation (a medical condition of an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to blood clot in the heart) who were prescribed warfarin or DOACs a part of normal clinical care and followed them up to compare the effect of warfarin on several COVID-19 related outcome with DOACs.Overall, this study show no evidence of harmful effect of warfarin on severe COVID-19 disease, compared with DOACs. This study provides reassurance about the safety of warfarin use among patient with atrial fibrillation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.(2) Early study showed that blood thinning treatment (anticoagulants) reduce the risk of thrombotic event amongst those infected. However, current evidence of the role of routinely prescribed oral anticoagulant (OACs) in COVID-19 outcome is unclear.Therefore, we studied a large number of people with atrial fibrillation (a medical condition of an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to blood clot in the heart) who had a low risk of stroke. Among this study cohort, the decision of prescribing OAC would typically be borderline. We followed them up to compare the effect of those who prescribed oral anticoagulant on several COVID-19 related outcome with those who did not .In conclusion, this study show that people receiving OACs had a lower risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19 outcome than non-users. This might be explained by the potential effect of OACs in preventing severe COVID-19 outcome or more cautious behaviour leading to reduced infection risk.Study lead: Organisation: NHS England (in collaboration with University of Oxford and LSHTM) Project #43: Ethnic difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, and death.Type: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: , Full paper: COVID-19 ha disproportionately affected minority ethnic population in the UK. Our aim wa to quantify ethnic difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcome during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England.GP data were linked to data from other source on the outcome of interest: SARS-CoV-2 testing and positive test result and COVID-19-related hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and death. Self-reported ethnicity a captured on the GP record wa used, grouped into five main category (White, South Asian, Black, other, and mixed) and 16 subcategories.Our finding show that minority ethnic group have higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death even after accounting for other medical condition individual may be suffering from; in particular, the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death in wave 2 were increased for South Asian group and reduced in all other ethnic minority group relative to the White group.The cause of the worse outcome for minority ethnic group is likely to involve many factor and require action across many fronts, including reducing structural inequalities, addressing barrier to equitable care, and improving uptake of testing and vaccination.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #42: HIV infection and COVID-19 related death.Type: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: Full paper: This study aimed to investigate whether people with HIV had different risk of dying from COVID-19 compared with people without HIV.We used anonymised electronic health record from GP practice and information from national death registration to compare COVID-19 death rate between people who had a record of HIV in the GP record and people with no record of HIV. We also took account of other factors, like age and other illnesses, that might affect risk of COVID-19 death.Over 17 million people were included, and 27480 had a record of HIV. People living with HIV had higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after taking account of other factor and this wa particularly pronounced in people of black ethnicity.We concluded that people with HIV in the UK seem to be at increased risk of dying from COVID-19. Targeted policy should be considered to address this raised risk a the pandemic response evolves.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #41: Factors associated with death due to COVID-19 versus other causes.Type: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: Full paper: The aim of this study wa to answer the question: to what extent is a person risk of dying from COVID-19 governed by their broader risk of death, based on their age, medical history, and other characteristics?We used anonymised routinely collected GP record data from over 17 million people and information on death and cause of death from national death registrations. We looked at all death after February 2020 and analysed how individual characteristic like age, ethnicity, and medical history were linked to both COVID and non-COVID deaths.We found that a person individual characteristic broadly affected their risk of COVID-19 death and non-COVID death in similar ways. But there were exceptions, most notably ethnicity: non-white group had higher risk of dying from COVID-19 death, despite generally lower risk of dying from non-COVID causes.We concluded that COVID-19 largely multiplies existing risk faced by patients, with some notable exceptions. Identifying the unique factor contributing to the higher COVID-19 mortality risk among non-white group is a priority to inform effort to reduce death from COVID-19.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #40: Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and risk of death from COVID-19.Type: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: Full paper: In the early pandemic, there have been concern that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs, such a ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, etc.) may increase the risk of COVID-19 related death, but the evidence for this wa lacking. This study investigated the routine use of NSAIDs and risk of COVID-19 related death using data from patient in a database covering 40% of the population of England.In the first study we identified people with an NSAID prescription in the last 3 year from the general population. We compared the risk of COVID-19 related death among these people with those who were not prescribed NSAIDs.In the second study we identified people with rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis and divided them into two groups: those who were prescribed NSAIDs and those who were not prescribed NSAIDS. We compared the risk of COVID-19 related death between these two groups.In both study we found no evidence of a harmful effect of routinely prescribed NSAIDs on COVID-19 related deaths. We concluded that becoming infected by COVID-19 should not influence decision about the routine prescribing of NSAIDs.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #39: Effect of pre-exposure use of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 death in patient with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.Type: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: Full paper: This is the first study, to our knowledge, to investigate the ongoing routine use of hydroxychloroquine and risk of COVID-19 mortality in a general population. In this study, which us a database that includes around 40% of the population of England, we investigated whether routine use of hydroxychloroquine before the COVID-19 outbreak (ie, pre-exposure) prevented COVID-19 death.We found no evidence to support a substantial benefit of hydroxychloroquine in preventing COVID-19 death. At the same time, we have shown no evidence of harm. The absence of clear harm or benefit would therefore support ongoing clinical trial using hydroxychloroquine.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #38: Inhaled corticosteroid and risk of COVID-19 death.Type: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: Full paper: This study aimed to evaluate how regular use of a type of drug used to treat respiratory diseases, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), might have influenced the risk of dying from COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic. We studied two group of people - those with asthma, and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - and compared their risk of death from COVID-19. We used a number of technique to try and account for the fact that people who receive treatment such a ICS are different from those who do not.We found that:For people with COPD, those who were prescribed ICS were at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 compared to those not receiving ICS treatments.For people with asthma, those receiving high-dose (but not low-dose) ICS were at higher risk of dying compared to those individual receiving a non-steroid based reliever inhaler (called salbutamol).However, our study result also suggest that the higher risk of death in individual taking ICS might not be fully related to the use of the ICS medication, and might also be related to other factors, for example, people using ICS typically have more severe lung disease, which might explain the reason why they have a higher risk of COVID-19 related death.We therefore concluded that our study provided no convincing evidence that use of ICS wa associated with an increased risk of dying from COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, which should be seen a reassuring for people with these respiratory disease who rely on ICS to manage their respiratory symptoms.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #37: Factors associated with COVID-19 related death.Type: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]GitHub: Full paper: We used the newly created OpenSAFELY platform to examine factor associated with COVID-19-related death. General practice record of 17,278,392 adult were linked to 10,926 COVID-19-related deaths. A range of factors, including demographic characteristic and comorbidities were explored to determine their relationship with COVID-19 related death.COVID-19-related death wa associated with: being male; greater age and deprivation; diabetes; severe asthma; and various other medical conditions. Compared with people of white ethnicity, Black and South Asian people were at higher risk, even after adjustment for other factors.We measured a range of factor associated with COVID-19-related death in one of the largest study of COVID-19 on this topic at this point in time, very early in the pandemic.Study leads: ,,Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #36: Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.Type: AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareAtrial fibrillation is a heart condition characterised by an irregular heartbeat. Patients with atrial fibrillation have an increased risk of stroke and NICE recommends they are treated with drug that reduce that risk of stroke (blood thinner or anticoagulants). Warfarin used to be the drug of choice but new anticoagulant that are safer and more convenient to take have been preferred for the past years. This is because warfarin requires adjusting the dose on a regular basis based on blood tests, which are a burden for patient and doctors. For safety reasons, during the COVID-19 pandemic, doctor were encouraged to switch patient from warfarin to the new anticoagulants. However, it is uncertain how many patient were actually switched to the new anticoagulant over time and which proportion of patient are currently prescribed the new anticoagulant a per NICE guidelines. Therefore, this study aim to ass the impact of the pandemic on compliance with NICE guideline regarding anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.Study leads: ,Organisation: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Project #35: Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on prevention of cardiovascular disease.Type: AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareCardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in England, accounting for one in four deaths. Risk factor for cardiovascular disease include non-modifiable factor (e.g., age, sex, family history, ethnic background) and modifiable risk factor (e.g., smoking, raised blood pressure and cholesterol). Assessing risk of cardiovascular disease and treating risk factor is very important to prevent heart attack and strokes. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused substantial disruption to usual care in GP practices, particularly during lockdowns. It is possible that many patient with risk factor for cardiovascular disease have missed opportunity for GPs to ass their risk and take the necessary steps, including prescribing drugs, to reduce that risk. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on assessment and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors, particularly raised blood pressure and cholesterol.Study leads: ,Organisation: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Project #34: Deaths at home during Covid-19 and implication for patient and services.Type: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThe Covid-19 pandemic ha seen a huge shift in where patient are dying, in addition to increased mortality overall. While the majority of patient who died from Covid-19 did so in hospital or care homes, between March 2020 and July 2021 a third more people than usual died at home, largely from cause other than Covid-19. At the same time, service for people at the end of life were severely disrupted, with many service shifting to remote working a far a possible. This impacted how much support patient and family received to care for people in their own homes.This study will use data from GP and hospital records, and data on registered death to:Understand what service were provided to patient who died over the course of the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic, and how did service use vary between sub-groups of patients? This will include considering place and cause of death, demographic, social and clinical factors.Develop measure of quality of end of life care from the data, taking account of the quality of the data available. We will use published standard on quality of care, for example, guidance from NICE, to identify potential measure of quality which could be identified from the data.Develop question for future research, once we have identified which measure of quality of care are feasible to ass from the data.The shift in place of death during the pandemic, and the exacerbation of existing health inequality and pressure on health and care services, make this an even more important policy area to address now.Study lead: Organisation: Nuffield Trust Project #33: Post-operative outcome and resource use in cancer surgery patient with perioperative SARS-CoV2.Type: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcarePatients who need surgery for cancer must balance the risk of undergoing and not undergoing surgery. The decision to undergo surgery is complicated by other existing condition and disease that the patient has. For example, there is some evidence that patient with an indication of SARS-CoV-2 infection might be at greater risk of death shortly after surgery, compared with patient who did not have an indication of infection. This increased risk might persist up to 7 week after surgery, in some cases.In light of the increased risk of death, NHS England and NHS Improvement issued to delay non-urgent, non-emergency operation for three months. The finding of research study around that time varied in their support of such delays. For example, suggested that non-emergency surgery should be delayed for more than 4 weeks, while suggested the increase in the risk of death related to a SARS-CoV-2 infection wa very low and might not outweigh the risk of delaying. The conflicting evidence make it difficult for hospital to safely plan surgeries, especially because it is not clear why there is such a wide range of advice given.Our study attempt to review the relationship between surgery timing and cancer patient outcome after surgery in light of the NHS England and NHS Improvement guidance. In addition to patient outcome - e.g. death and post-operative complication - we will study the effect of surgery timing and patient SARS-CoV-2 status on outcome related to hospital planning (e.g. patient length of stay in hospital and readmission after discharge).Study lead: Organisation: University of Leeds and NIHR Yorkshire and Humber Patient and Safety Translational Research Centre Project #32: The emergence of Omicron in England.Type: ResearchTopic areas: COVID transmission/prevalence/non-pharmaceutical prevention; Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]; COVID vaccine effectiveness/safetyWe will describe the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection in England in comparison to Delta infections. Should Omicron become established in England, we will compare the risk of re-infection, hospitalisation and death between the Omicron and Delta variants.These data will be vital to understand the impact that the emergence of Omicron will have on the course of the pandemic in England and around the world.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #31: Risk factor and prediction model for Long COVID.Type: ResearchTopic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]Reports of people developing long-lasting post COVID symptom are rising, with a latest estimate of 1.1 million people living in private household in the UK (1.7% of the population), according to the Office of National Statistics. However, little is known about which group of individual with a history of COVID-19 are more likely to have symptom over a long period (e.g. more than 12 weeks). Recent research showed that not all patient who self-report long COVID have been diagnosed clinically or referred to recovery service by their doctors.This is a population based cohort study from the electronic health record using the OpenSAFELY platform. In this study, we aim to identify risk factor associated with long COVID diagnosis in the primary care records. We will investigate the following questions:What are the risk factor associated with long COVID diagnosis?What are the difference between risk factor for acute COVID and long COVID?Can we predict or discriminate between these two type of COVID?How the clinical coding of long COVID diagnosis impact on the above analyses?The identified risk factor will help increase the awareness of long COVID, improve the diagnosis coverage and subsequently improve the access/referral to recovery service and inform a risk prediction model to identify and prioritise care, education and rehabilitation for patient at risk of long COVID.Study lead: Organisation: University of Plymouth / University of Bristol Project #30: Pathology Comparators Short Report.Type: AuditTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]; Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]; Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareIn this study we will investigate how blood test result can be interpreted in OpenSAFELY. Blood test result give u important information about someone health. However, for some tests, the value can be reported a le than or more than a threshold, typically for value outside the accurate range that the machine can detect. Therefore a test result may appear a <10, and for some test this type of result is very common. However, when conducting research, researcher may wish to group patient together and if the comparators (< and >) are not taken into account we may group the value incorrectly, e.g. the <10 above would be taken a 10 and incorrectly grouped with value >=10. Here we will identify which test involve comparators most often, and which value they are typically associated with. For example, if a certain test often ha value >5.5 then when creating group researcher might need to use 5.5 a their highest value. The finding of this audit will be useful in various context, for example (a) assessing patient severity of preexisting disease, which may impact their risk from COVID, (b) assessing the impact on patient health after contracting COVID or (c) assessing indirect impact of COVID on healthcare provision (e.g. whether people with diabetes generally experienced worsening disease during the pandemic).Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #29: Monitoring Attendance INvestigations Referrals and OUTcomEs related to Cancer in the NHS through the COVID-19 era (MAINROUTE).Type: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareHealth care and the way we consult doctor ha changed a a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Many more appointment with doctor (GPs) have been over the telephone instead of in person. Many routine appointments, blood tests, cancer screening and non-urgent treatment have been cancelled in both GP practice and in hospitals. Urgent cancer referral reduced dramatically.However, it is unlikely that patient have stopped having symptoms. It is more likely that people have been avoiding going to the doctor or to the hospital. This may be because they do not want to bother doctor or nurse at this time of higher workload, or they are not sure that GPs are available to deal with non-COVID problem or they are worried about catching the virus. This could mean that there may be a build-up of medical problem in the community. Delays in the diagnosis or treatment of condition such a cancer may cause longer-term health problem for some group of patients. As social distancing rule are relaxed, and life start to return to normal, doctor will need to catch-up on clinical care for a wide range of conditions.This study will track change in the number of people visiting their GP for symptom of cancer, the number of test done, number of hospital appointment and longer-term outcome focussing on cancer. We will present the data so that GP and hospital staff will be able to see which disease area or group of patient that will be most in need.Study leads: ,,Organisation: University of Oxford Project #28: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer and COVID-19Type: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareAndrogen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer is used to shrink the cancer before or after the surgery or radiotherapy. ADT is also used to manage advanced cancer that cannot be cured with surgery and radiotherapy. Patients receive injection monthly or every three month long-term. In this research we are seeking to investigate if and how this wa affected during the pandemic. There is evidence that the pandemic affected access to healthcare, especially when face-to-face appointment were required for the provision of services. We will access primary care and hospital (SUS) data to ass the impact on ADT delivery.In this study we will extract and analyse data on the prescribing of injectable form of ADT for prostate cancer between pre-pandemic (2015-2019) and pandemic year (2020-2021) to investigate any potential effect of the COVID-19 on the delivery of ADT for prostate cancer. This information may help to identify where service require more support a well a assist government and policymakers plan for future lockdown and pandemics.We will also analyse by age, ethnicity, deprivation, region of the country and care-home residency to identify possible patient group with difficulty in accessing medication. Prostate cancer, comparatively, is one of the cancer more strongly affected by demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities.Study lead: Organisation: University of Surrey / University of Oxford Project #27: The effect of COVID-19 on pancreatic cancer diagnosis and care.Type: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcarePancreatic cancer is relatively rare (10,000 new case per year) and a difficult cancer to diagnose early. Due to the difficulty in early diagnosis it ha a high mortality rate, with 90% of people dying within a year from diagnosis.It is therefore possible that the COVID-19 pandemic ha resulted in delayed diagnosis and worse outcome in pancreatic cancer care.In this service evaluation we will investigate if there wa any detrimental effect of COVID-19 on pancreatic cancer including stage at diagnosis (are people diagnosed at more advanced stages), and the mechanism that lead to diagnosis and healthcare provided.This information may help to identify where service require more support a well a assist government and policymakers plan for future lockdown and pandemics.Study lead: Organisation: University of Surrey / University of Oxford Project #26: Uptake of 'NHS @home' intervention during COVID-19.Type: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThe use of NHS@Home intervention a a mean of patient better self-managing health and care at home ha been a key part of NHS Englands response to the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis aim to establish the breadth and depth of coverage - geographically and among the target populations. This will not be used in performance management, but rather a an initial assessment of uptake and usage of the service to inform modelling and help shape future analysis requirements.Study lead: Organisation: NHS England and NHS Improvement Project #25: Representativeness of TPP data.Type: AuditTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThe OpenSAFELY framework allows analysis of the full pseudonymised patient primary care record for 57 million people registered at a general practice in England. This comprises 24m patient from practice that use TPP and 33m patient from practice that use EMIS. Use of the TPP and EMIS system is known to be geographically clustered, however little is currently known about the extent to which the separate population within these system is representative of the population at large.OpenSAFELY ha been, and continues to be, used to support research that delivered urgent result related to the global COVID-19 emergency.Assessing sample representativeness is a critical component of health research and provides context for researcher to understand the validity / applicability of their research. Understanding difference in geographic spread, sex, age, IMD and ethnicity distribution between TPP patient and non-TPP patient is important for the interpretation of COVID-19 research analysis and generalization to the background population.In order to understand the representativeness of TPP data we will compare broad demographic data to ONS estimate for England for Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD); age and sex and population per MSOA / STP. We will also compare ethnic breakdown of TPP to the 2011 ONS Census and compare the 5 most common underlying cause of death in England in 2020 ONS to the equivalent in TPP.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #24: Incidence of mental illness following coronavirus infection in the community.Topic areas: Post-COVID health impact [e.g. long COVID]Mental health condition such a anxiety and depression have become more prevalent throughout the population during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, but the existing evidence a to whether people infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at greater risk is mixed. This study will therefore examine rate of common mental disorders, serious mental illness and mental health behaviour (such a self-harm) in people aged 16 year or over infected with SARS-CoV-2, for up to a year after the first testing positive for the virus. Rates of these condition will be compared with those in several non-infected control group (people who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, and people diagnosed with influenza before and during the pandemic) to ascertain the extent to which risk is elevated after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The finding of this study may identify group of the population particularly at risk of mental health condition following infection, and inform public health policy and service provision around mental health.Study lead: Organisation: Office for National Statistics Project #23: Risk of severe COVID-19 outcome associated with atopic eczema and dupilumab.Type: ResearchTopic areas: Risk from COVID (short term) [e.g. hospitalisation/death]In a recent study we found that people with condition that are related to problem with the immune system, such a Cohns disease, psoriasis, and arthritis, and people taking treatment affecting the immune system might be at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Atopic eczema, a common skin condition presenting with itching and rash, is also thought to be related to problem with the immune system, and some individual with more severe eczema are treated with dupilumab, a drug that affect the immune system. In this study we aim to explore whether people with eczema and people with eczema who take dupilumab are at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Clinicians and public health expert need to know this, in order to develop strategy to prevent severe COVID-19 in people with atopic eczema.Study lead: Organisation: University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Project #22: Investigating the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination programme in the UK.Type: ResearchTopic areas: COVID vaccine effectiveness/safetyAll adult in the UK are eligible to receive coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine to protect them against COVID-19. The vaccine currently available are given in two doses. Most people who have had a 2nd dose received it 8 to 12 week after their 1st dose. Although clinical trial have shown that the vaccine are safe and effective at protecting against COVID-19, there are still many question that need to be answered in order to understand longer term effect of vaccination and keep people protected against COVID-19. Our work aim to understand the long-term effect by answering question such as:Which group are choosing not to get their COVID-19 vaccines?Does the protection given by the vaccine against COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death reduce over time?Does the time between the 1st and 2nd dos affect the efficacy of the vaccine against COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death?What is the effect of additional (more than 2) dos of the vaccine?Study leads: ,,Organisation: University of Bristol Project #21: Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC) prescribing during COVID-19.Type: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareDuring COVID-19, GPs have been encouraged to switch patient from Warfarin to alternative anticoagulant called Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) a they require le frequent monitoring and avoid additional visit to the GP practice. DOACs do however require renal function test to ensure the correct dose is prescribed to avoid harm in patients. This evaluation want to identify the proportion of patient who are at risk of harm whilst prescribed the incorrect dose of DOAC.Study lead: Organisation: PrescQIPP CIC Project #20: Ethnic disparity in COVID19 outcome in London: evaluation of COVID19 vaccination programme.Type: Service evaluationTopic areas: COVID vaccine eligibility/coverage; Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareThis study will explore the impact of COVID-19 on those of ethnic minority background in London throughout the pandemic and determine whether the vaccination programme ha made a difference in ethnic disparity in health outcomes. We will also look at potential mechanism through which COVID-19 ha an adverse effect on people of minority ethnic backgrounds, these include whether there is a greater impact from certain health conditions, living environments, certain health behaviour such a vaccination uptake.Study lead: Organisation: Department of Health and Social Care (originally application made by Public Health England) Project #19: How ha the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the need for targeted weight management intervention amongst adult in the UK? An evaluation of pandemic-associated change in BMI and metabolic parameters.Type: Service evaluationTopic areas: Other/indirect impact of COVID on health/healthcareLockdowns, stay at home order and social distancing guideline have had an impact on the lifestyle of people living in the UK. Studies have shown a reduction in physical activity during the pandemic, using a variety of data source such a smartphone apps, recording from implantable cardiac device and surveys. Some international survey have reported that lifestyle change during the pandemic have resulted in weight gain and increased Body Mass Index (BMI) (a measure of if you are a healthy weight for your height). In the UK people joining the NHS Diabetes Prevention Program, a targeted intervention for people at high risk of diabetes, in the year following the pandemic were on average heavier than those who joined the programme in the year before the pandemic. But there is a lack of data on how the weight (and consequently BMI) of the general population of adult living in the UK ha changed since the onset of the pandemic.Even prior to the pandemic, obesity wa common in the UK. The 2019 Health Survey for England demonstrated that 64% of adult were overweight or obese. Obesity ha long been known to be a risk factor for the development of a range of condition such a diabetes, heart disease and stroke. This can be through the effect of obesity on established marker of metabolic risk such as: Blood Pressure (BP), Blood Cholesterol and Lipids Profiles (Lipid Profile), and blood sugar level measured by Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Furthermore, obesity, and condition linked to obesity such a diabetes, have been shown to increase the risk of hospitalisation and/or death from COVID-19.In response to these challenge the NHS ha invested in a range of intervention to support weight loss. Such a the NHS England Digital Weight Management Programme (DWMP), which is currently available to help overweight and obese people living with diabetes and/or hypertension manage their weight. This analysis will look at how the number of people meeting the eligibility criterion for the DWMP ha changed since the onset of the pandemic through assessing BMI change in these groups. We will also describe, amongst all adult living in the UK, how BMI and metabolic marker have changed since the onset of the pandemic, in order to ass the need for weight loss intervention in the overall population.We will further investigate whether some group of people have, since the onset of the pandemic, experienced more weight gain (and resultant increase in BMI) and/or worsening of their metabolic marker than others. These group will be identified based on personal characteristic (such a age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and/or region of residence) and whether they have another co-existent medical condition, such a asthma or chronic kidney disease. This will demonstrate specific population group that may most benefit from targeted weight loss interventions. We will specifically look at co-existing medical condition that have been deemed common and important by the NHS Qualify Outcome Framework (QOF) - a tool that is used to ass the quality of care provided by GPs.The finding of this study will help inform NHS England health care policy around the extent of need for specific weight loss intervention and which specific group are at greatest need of these interventions. Furthermore, we hope the finding of the analysis will inform future focussed research.Study lead: Organisation: Queen Mary's University London Project #18: Understanding to what extent the actual treatment of people with ongoing symptom of COVID-19 match published NICE guidance?Type: AuditWe need to know to what extent the actual treatment of people with ongoing symptom of COVID-19 match published NICE guidance. This corresponds to carrying out an audit. If difference are found, NICE could use the information either to improve the presentation of guideline or improve it implementation work.This study us OpenSAFELY data to compare summarised information from GP record against NICEs guideline for long-term effect of COVID-19.Study lead: Organisation: NICE Project #17: Effects of COVID-19 on people with diabetesType: ResearchSince the outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK, primary care ha changed quite dramatically, with many general practice restricting physical consultation and instead providing phone and video consultations. This ha affected the monitoring and management of a range of long-term condition and is of particular importance in people with diabetes who would ordinarily have their diabetes and associated comorbidities frequently monitored through diabetic review at their GP practice and at diabetes clinic within the NHS. It is not yet understood what impact the change in access to service ha had on these patient in term of their diabetes control, cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes-related complications, and mortality.In previous work, we sought to compare the frequency of primary care interactions, services, monitoring, prescribing, and diagnosis before and after the start of the pandemic, with a view to quantifying the level of unmet need in this patient group and highlighting the anticipated backlog that primary care service would face a restriction were gradually eased. In this proposed phase of the project, we aim to examine rate of hospitalisation, ICU admissions, diabetes-related complication and associated adverse event by combining data from primary and secondary care, and to investigate specific cause of mortality in people with diabetes.Study lead: Organisation: University of Manchester Project #16: How ha COVID-19 impacted primary care treatment pathway for common colds, antibiotic prescribing and antibiotic exposure?Type: Research and service evaluationThe Covid-19 pandemic ha resulted in major change in how and whether patient can consult their General Practitioner. This ha an impact on how their common infection (such a sore throat or bladder) are being diagnosed and treated. The number of telephone or web appointment ha increased and there are concerns, in addition to patient not consulting their GP, that more antibiotic may be given inappropriately a it is difficult to diagnose remotely.Prior to Covid-19, improvement in antibiotic prescribing in primary care (also known a antibiotic stewardship) were a major priority for the NHS. This wa related to increased rate of infection in which antibiotic no longer work (known a antibiotic resistance), often related to overuse of antibiotics.This project will provide up-to-date information to antibiotic stewardship activity in primary care.Specific aim are to evaluatethe impact of Covid-19 on the primary care treatment pathway for common infectionsthe effect on antibiotic prescribingthe effect of prior antibiotic exposure (types and extent) on severity of outcome in Covid-19 infection (including during and after hospital admission)Study lead: Organisation: University of Manchester Project #15: Investigating how the prescribing of group of medicine used to treat mental health of resident of carehomes ha changed over the COVID-19 periodType: Service evaluationWe will investigate how the prescribing of group of medicine used to treat the mental health of resident of care home ha changed over the COVID-19 period. Residents have been more socially isolated given restriction on visit from family and friend and trip outside the care home setting. There have also been high rate of death in care home due to COVID-19, which may have affected the mental health of surviving resident and staff.Given rate of depression, anxiety and stress are considered to have , we are interested in looking at how the prescribing of anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medicine to resident in care home ha changed over the COVID-19 pandemic and relative to the general population.Study lead: Organisation: NHS England & NHS Improvement Project #14: How ha the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the number of PSA test performed to diagnose/monitor prostate cancer?Type: Service evaluationThe NHS Cancer Programme is working to identify more people with prostate cancer a part of the pandemic recovery. To aid that work, we would like to know:What wa the impact of the pandemic on the number of patient who received prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests?If there wa an impact on PSA test undertaken, which patient did this affect (by patient characteristic, geography, symptom at presentation)?Was the change in the quantity of PSA test undertaken followed by a corresponding drop in the number of patient receiving onwards test and treatment for prostate cancer?Study leads: ,,Organisation: NHS England and NHS Improvement Project #13: Long COVIDType: Research and service evaluationWe want to understand how many people are diagnosed with Long COVID in general practice, who is diagnosed with Long COVID, and how long after getting COVID-19 people are diagnosed with Long COVID. We will also find out how this change over time; and how different comorbidities and other factor impact the above.Study lead: Organisation: NHS England and NHS Improvement Project #12: Investigating event following SARS-CoV-2 infectionType: ResearchCOVID-19 infection may increase the chance of certain conditions, including stroke and heart attacks. We will study people alive on 1 January 2020 with a record in OpenSAFELY to investigate whether this is the case. Specifically, we will compare the number of people with COVID-19 infection who also have a record of one of these condition against the number of people without COVID-19 infection who also have a record of one of these conditions. This will allow u to estimate how much COVID-19 infection increase the risk of these conditions. Our work may inform whether people with COVID-19 infection should be offered preventative treatment to protect against these conditions.Study leads: ,,Organisation: University of Bristol Project #11: Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on antidepressant prescribingType: Service evaluationWe will ass the impact of COVID-19 on antidepressant prescribing; one of five medicine class identified in the PHE Review which NHSE/I are prioritising and leading on. As described by the OpenSafely paper in the Lancet, addressing the effect that the pandemic ha had on mental health is important and we will use primary care data to measure and mitigate the indirect health impact of COVID-19 on the NHS.We will investigate whether potential barrier to accessing mental health service over the course of the pandemic have led to specific (or a change in) indication driving the already increasing trend in antidepressant prescribing by observing:the rate of new initiation of antidepressantsthe discontinuation of antidepressantsWe will investigate the the impact of COVID-19 on dependency forming medication use by age, gender, Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), ethnicity, region (and other system level geographical cuts)Study lead: Organisation: NHS England and NHS Improvement Project #10Type: Service EvaluationConcern raised by the national clinical director of cardiovascular disease (CVD) about inequality in the prevalence of CVD. The purpose for requesting GP record data in OpenSAFELY is to monitor service use for CVD pathways, blood pressure test taken, corresponding reading, and medical prescription across geographical deprivation and ethnic groups. These metric will serve a potential indicator for access and outcome (for people of different ethnicities/people living in area with different level of deprivation) in CVD related primary care activity. We will particularly be monitoring the variation in these indicator that occurred over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and assessing the relative success or failure in recovering primary care services.AimsTo better understand and be able to interpret disparity in access and outcome related to CVD to narrow health inequality in this area.To use CVD and this analysis a a test case in the process necessary for developing primary care recovery of service indicator with OpenSAFELYOrganisation: NHS England and NHS Improvement Project #9: What are the pattern of healthcare use in child and young people with SARS-CoV-2 in the 12 month following infection?Type: ResearchThis project will link ISARIC-4C and OpenSAFELY data in order to follow up hospitalised patient with COVID-19 following discharge. ISARIC-4C is a UK-wide consortium responsible for prospectively collecting data and biological sample from hospitalised patient with COVID-19.The aim of the project are to investigate child and young people under the age of 19 year with covid-19 to:Assess the feasibility of combining a detailed clinical dataset of patient hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 (ISARIC-4C dataset) with wide-ranging primary care data (OpenSAFELY dataset)Investigate risk factor for hospital admission and disease severityInvestigate outcome for child hospitalised with covid-19 stratified by severity, compared to those cared for in the communityStudy lead: Olivia SwannOrganisation: ISARIC Project #8: Examining the effect of randomising dissemination of the Germ Defence website via GP practice on rate of respiratory infection, including COVID-19 and seasonal fluType: ResearchRecent research into coronavirus ha shown that member of the public can play a crucial role in controlling infection outbreaks, by adopting simple behaviour to curb the spread of infection in the home such a handwashing, cleaning surfaces, wearing of face covering and social distancing. Despite public health advice, evidence show most people need to change their behaviour to help prevent infection.Germ Defence is an employing behaviour change technique to supplement public health advice. Germ Defence wa originally developed during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic using theory, evidence and extensive feedback from member of the public. It wa then trialled in over 20,000 patient and shown to reduce the number and severity of infection of user and member of their household. Germ Defence ha recently been updated for the COVID-19 pandemic. The website aim to help user with pre-planning about effective isolation of an infected household member; personalised goal setting for increasing a range of infection control behaviours; changing the home environment to support new habit and problem solving to overcome barriers.What is the aim of the project?This project aim to examine the effect of randomising dissemination of the Germ Defence website via GP practice on rate of respiratory infection, including COVID-19 and seasonal flu.What are we doing?We will contact every GP practice in England and ask them to share the link to Germ Defence with their patients. Half of the practice will be randomly chosen and asked to immediately send out the Germ Defence link to their patient in the Autumn of 2020. These practice will be known a the intervention arm or immediate implementation group. The other half of the practice will be contacted to send out Germ Defence in March 2021 and will be known a the usual care arm or delayed implementation group. We will ass usage of the Germ Defence link from anonymous data produced by the website. We will then use anonymised national data that is collected a part of routine care to compare whether infection rate are lower in practice that sent Germ Defence information to their patient immediately, compared to those that didnt send the information until later.Study lead: Organisation: University of Bristol Project #5Type: Service evaluationThe aim of this work is to ass NHS England guidance issued at the peak of the COVID pandemic recommending FIT (stool) testing for all patient suspected of colo-rectal cancer which could be undertaken in primary or secondary care. The extent to which this advice ha been implemented across the system, particularly in primary care, is unknown, since routine operational reporting from pathology system is not a mandatory requirement.In addition FIT testing in patient aged <50 (who are at very low risk of colo-rectal cancer) may be adding to the demand for the cancer two week waits, Lower GI referral and subsequent colonoscopy.Analysis of the data will allow u to determine if particular variable (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, locality, FIT level, etc.) are related to an increased risk of colo-rectal cancer diagnosis, and importantly, if patient can be categorised into a very low risk of colo-rectal cancer. NHS England would then ensure that these output were included in further guidance to support more appropriate and targeted referral for colonoscopy when investigating suspected colo-rectal cancer.Study lead: Organisation: Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust and University of Exeter Project #4: The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine against clinical outcomes: a test negative case control study using OpenSAFELYType: ResearchThe effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine against clinical outcomes: a test negative case control study using OpenSAFELYBackgroundAs soon a SARS-CoV2 wa identified a the virus causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, scientist and vaccine manufacturer worked rapidly to develop vaccine against it. Since late 2020, the UK ha been rolling out a phased mass vaccination programme in the adult population, starting with people at greatest risk of severe infection. In clinical trial with volunteers, all three of the UKs currently authorised vaccine were good at protecting recipient against infection but now that the vaccination programme is underway, it is important to look at how protective the vaccine are in the real world.Aims of the studyTo determine the type-specific vaccine effectiveness of individual deployed COVID-19 vaccine in preventing laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection in specified subgroup of the population.To determine the type-specific vaccine effectiveness of individual COVID-19 vaccine used to vaccinate the UK population in preventing hospitalisation due to COVID-19 related disease in specified subgroup of the population.MethodsIn this study we will evaluate how good each vaccine is at protecting people against infection with SARS-CoV2, and also at preventing serious outcome of COVID-19 such a hospitalisation. We will use a test-negative case control design study to compare COVID-19 vaccination status in people with symptom of COVID19 who have a positive SARS-CoV2 test (cases) with people who also have symptom but who have a negative test (controls). Using this study design, we will also look at the vaccine effectiveness in particular subgroups, such a the elderly and people with poorly functioning immune systems, to see if the vaccine work le well in some groups.We will estimate the vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection and serious outcome at different time point after the first and second dos of the vaccine, and after a booster dose if this is recommended. Logistic regression will be used to determine adjusted type-specific vaccine effectiveness estimate and we will repeat analysis at interval for up to 3 year after the start of the vaccine rollout to detect waning VE.We will use a secure analytic platform, OpenSAFELY, to run analysis code against approximately 24 million routinely collected electronic health record (EHRs) for adult patient who are registered at GP practices. This study will complement other study using different data source or study design, and will add to the body of knowledge to inform the government expert independent advisory body, the JCVI, when it make recommendation on future vaccination policy.Study lead: Organisation: University of Nottingham Project #3Type: ResearchThe aim of the study is to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine for COVID-19 using the age threshold in the JCVI COVID-19 vaccination first phase priority group under a modelling approach known a a regression discontinuity design.Study lead: Organisation: University of Bristol Project #2: Online consultationsType: Service evaluationGitHub: (under review to make public)An online consultation enables a patient to contact their GP, other health professional or GP practice staff over the internet, typically by using a smartphone, tablet or computer. This is a fairly new technology in term of adoption, though it use had been accelerated by the pandemic. NHSE/I, through it Digital First Primary Care (DFPC) programme, ha been working on enabling and stimulating the use of online consultation system a a mean to improve access to primary care and make best use of clinician time.OpenSAFELY wa identified a a way of providing intelligence on online consultation activity prior and alongside the pandemic, particularly in the way event are recorded or not in primary care record via dedicated codes. In this initial discovery piece, we looked at:understanding how certain online consultation-relevant code of were used in term of adoption and volumeunderstanding broad demographic and past clinical history of those associated with online consultation-relevant codesThese insight are being triangulated further with supplier data and qualitative finding a part of a wider research piece.

Open menu (current)More (current)More/About OpenSAFELYAbout OpenSAFELYOpenSAFELY is a secure, transparent, open-source software platform for analysis of electronic health record data. All platform activity is publicly logged. All code for data management and analysis is shared, under open license and by default, for scientific review and efficient re-use.OpenSAFELY is a set of best practice encoded a software. It can be deployed to create a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) alongside appropriate database, compute, governance, and administrative elements; or it can be deployed a a privacy-enhancing layer on any existing secure database or TRE.OpenSAFELY software is currently deployed within the secure data centre of the two largest electronic health record provider in the NHS, : thereby creating OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS. We are also deploying OpenSAFELY in other data centre with other NHS partner to support rapid, transparent, and open analytics. Designed to provide secure and federated analytics, OpenSAFELY help the NHS minimise the sharing of confidential patient information.Pseudonymisation and access controlsTo understand the technical design choice of OpenSAFELY, it is helpful to first understand the privacy and disclosure risk which the tool aim to mitigate. Pseudonymisation is a widely used process for protecting patient privacy whereby explicit identifier such a names, addresses, and date of birth are removed from patient medical record before they are used or shared. Pseudonymisation is necessary to protect patient privacy, but it is not a sufficient safeguard on it own. For example, pseudonymisation might help to prevent a researcher accidentally seeing a piece of information about someone they know, flashing past on the screen; but beyond this, it doe very little to preserve privacy. For example, in a comprehensive set of NHS patient records, someone misusing the data could easily find and read Tony Blairs entire health record by searching for a patient who match information that is openly available on his Wikipedia page: his age, the approximate date he wa treated for an abnormal heart rhythm, and the fact that he lived in London.Because this kind of re-identification can be easy, we believe that detailed pseudonymised health data should be handled a if it were identifiable, taking all reasonable technical step to prevent and detect misuse of the data: it should be disseminated a little a possible; accessed in environment that do their best to prevent researcher ever needing to even view the underlying raw data; and managed in a setting where comprehensive log of all action are kept, and ideally shared, in a form where they can be easily reviewed at scale. These technical safeguard should sit alongside the other widely implemented administrative safeguard to scrutinise that the proposed analysis is likely to have public benefit, and to evaluate user and ensure that all analyst accessing data are trustworthy: function that support .Core Design Features for Privacy, Transparency, and Open WorkingOpenSAFELY aim to substantially exceed, by design, the current requirement on securing sensitive healthcare data.OpenSAFELY doe not move patient data outside of the secure environment where it already resides: instead, trusted analyst can run large scale computation across pseudonymised patient record in situ, and in near-real-time.In the case of OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS, we have implemented OpenSAFELY inside the data centre of the largest provider of GP electronic health record software in England, in the location where patient record already reside. This mean that the data never move location. (It also mean that we get to work closely with EHR software developer in these companies, who know their own data extremely well).However this is not the only privacy safeguard. In addition, we do not give user unconstrained access to view and manipulate raw data on a remote machine: instead, user work on the data at arm length using OpenSAFELY services.OpenSAFELY contains a range of flexible, pragmatic, but broadly standardised tool that user work with to convert raw patient data into research ready datasets, and to then execute code across those datasets. Standardising the data management pathway in this way brings numerous benefit around re-usability, efficiency, security, and transparency.All code created for data management and analysis can be shared, informatively, for review and re-use by all subsequent users. In most setting for NHS patient data analysis the same data management task are achieved by a huge range of bespoke and duplicative methods, in a huge range of different tools, with single task often spread between platform or programming languages. In OpenSAFELY the data management is always done the same way, using the same OpenSAFELY tools, so code is created in a form where it can be quickly read, understood, adapted, and re-used by any user for any other data science project.Users are blocked from directly viewing the raw patient data or the research ready datasets, but still write code a if they were in a live data environment. In most other setting analyst write their code, which convert raw data into finished graph and tables, by working directly with (and seeing) the real data, iterating and testing a they go. In OpenSAFELY, the data management tool used to produce their research-ready datasets also produce simulated, randomly generated dummy data that ha the same structure a the real data, but none of the disclosive risks. Every researcher is therefore provided with a where they can build all their data management and analysis code quickly, but only against dummy patient data. This minimises needle interaction with disclosive patient record and allows anyone with technical skill to swifty check and reproduce the methods. Researchers develop all their code for statistical analysis, dashboards, graph and table against this dummy data, using open tool and service like GitHub. Their code is then tested automatically by the OpenSAFELY tools, using the dummy data. When it is capable of running to completion, it is packaged up inside a container, using a tool called Docker. All their data management and analysis code is then sent securely into the live data environment to be executed against the real patient data: researcher can only view their result table and graphs, but no researcher ever need to enter the real patient-data environment, or see the real patient data. It is useful to contrast this against other setting which work with synthetic data (real data, but with statistical noise added in an effort to preserve privacy): they typically require researcher to also use that synthetic data to run their analyses, which can undermine the reliability of the results: in OpenSAFELY the synthetic dummy data is only used for code development, not code execution. In this way we get all the privacy preserving benefit of completely random synthetic data, but also retain all of the analytic benefit that come from executing code against real patient data.All code ever executed against the patient data can be shared, a an informative public log, because none of that code is disclosive of patient data. Normally TREs that execute code against real patient data try to keep a log of activity in the platform, but they cannot share every action in each user session, because the code for data management and analysis wa generated while working directly with the real data, and so there is a substantial risk that the code itself might contain some disclosive information about individual patients. Some platform log screen recordings, or keystrokes, for later review, but these can also never be shared openly, because of the disclosure risk (they are also laborious to review). OpenSAFELY code is only generated by working with dummy data, so we can be certain that it is non-disclosive. This mean it can be shared, and so we do share it: all of it, automatically, in public, and by default. This mean that every interested stakeholder can see what every analyst ha done with patient data inside OpenSAFELY, and all patients, professional and policymakers can be confident that data ha only been used for the purpose for which access wa granted: this is crucial for building trust, and a substantial improvement on the current paradigm whereby TREs only share a list of project with permissions. The removal of privacy risk from data management and analysis code also free up OpenSAFELY code for sharing and re-use under open licenses: it mean that there is no information governance or privacy barrier to user sharing code for others to review, critically evaluate, improve, and re-use, wherever they wish.These working methods, and the code in which they are embodied, mean that OpenSAFELY substantially exceeds current best practice around secure execution of analysis code on pseudonymised patient data, when combined with the other governance feature of a strong TRE. After completion of each analysis, only is released outside the secure environment, such a summary table or figures, after strict disclosivity check and redactions, to ensure . When access to any TRE, including one using OpenSAFELY code, is considered to be appropriate, the dataset described by the study definition should also be justified and proportionate, in accordance with the and the .Broad Collaboration, pooling best practiceOpenSAFELY ha been built a a broad collaboration between a huge range of organisations, and users, each of whom bring unique expertise.The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science at the University of Oxford led on building the software platform, a a mixed team of software developer and traditional academic researchers.The EHR group at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ha decade of deep expertise on working with GP data and other form of NHS electronic health records.TPP and EMIS are electronic health record system supplier covering 58 million patient record in total across England: they have very deep knowledge of electronic health record data, and have provided data infrastructure and other support pro bono for OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic.NHS England and NHSX handle all information governance, permissions, and additional data sources.We also have a growing list of broader collaboration including ICNARC, ISARIC, PHOSP, ONS, the National Core Studies Longitudinal Health team representing a range of cohort studies, and more.Together we represent a large national team of software developers, clinicians, and epidemiologists, all pooling diverse skill and knowledge to deliver high performance, highly secure, and high quality data analysis on NHS records. Our aim is to combine best practice from academia and the open source software development community. We now have a growing community of health data analyst who can speak the same language a software developers, doing pull request and code reviews; and full stack software developer with deep knowledge and understanding of health service and NHS data.The project is led by Ben Goldacre, Director of the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science; Seb Bacon, CTO at the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science; and Liam Smeeth, Director of LSHTM.Transparency and public logsOpenSAFELY doe not rely on an assumption of trust: it aim to be provably trustworthy, and transparent, by providing a full public log of all activity in the platform. This allows patients, professional and the public to hold the entire system accountable, because it their data being used for public benefit. Below are some example of how we drive accountability:All project started within OpenSAFELY are visible to the public. For example, .OpenSAFELY requires all researcher to archive and publish their analytic code: this is the only way they are allowed to run code against real data. For example, ha it , which link to the used to generate the analysis (and a of every version of the code ever run).Every time a researcher want to run this code against real data, in public.Every time a researcher change their code, it is automatically checked in public ( are a record of this), to provide reassurance it can be run without errors.Clinical research isnt only about writing analytic code. It also involves compiling codelists: set of clinical term that define symptoms, investigations, diseases, condition or other action (such a the provision of a referral letter, or a sick note). The OpenSAFELY platform includes for creating and sharing codelists in public; for example, , which includes of how the codelist wa constructed.It is accepted that some code may remain private while an analysis is in development. However, all code is published when the result of the analysis are shared (or, for non-complete projects, a soon a possible, usually at the point of their cessation, and no later than 12 month after any code ha been executed against the raw patient data).The OpenSAFELY commitment to public accountability also extends to how the software is developed. The software is developed on a non-commercial basis by the at the University of Oxford, and is to inspect, and re-use. is published on all aspect of the platform. All the feature development and product support is in .Ethics and IntegrityAs in all other research setting OpenSAFELY user are expected to maintain the highest standard of research integrity a described by, for example, Universities UKs and the . Research project must be scientifically sound and guided by ethical principles: a with all other research work, gaining appropriate research ethic approval is a prerequisite for using the OpenSAFELY platform.All information governance for OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS is handled by NHS England. Research proposal submitted for possible execution in OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS are assessed by NHS England and the OpenSAFELY collaboration in accordance with the process reviewed by the . This ensures that the platform is used for . In OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS code can currently be executed against the full pseudonymised primary care record of over 58 million people, linked onto multiple additional source of person-level data: this is a privilege, made possible by patient and the NHS; the scale of this privilege must never be forgotten. All OpenSAFELY researcher , and be cognisant of their obligation to respect the individual to whom the data relates. The intention, design and process of the research should be appropriately described and justified in a research proposal or protocol, noting that the OpenSAFELY platform can currently only be used to support research that will deliver urgent result related to the .It is important that research team are accountable for delivering on their pre-specified aims: in addition to other mechanism used by the research community to achieve this objective, all activity on OpenSAFELY is clearly logged, leaving a record of every analysis executed by each user. All code is made public at the point that result are shared, if not sooner. All result from OpenSAFELY analysis must be shared within 12 month of execution (a code of conduct we require all researcher to sign up to): this should be regarded a the absolute latest data for sharing, with a clear expectation of rapid dissemination in preprints, reports, and papers.Contributing to best practice around open scienceOpenSAFELY ha been built a a service that aim to embody best practice around open science. In particular, it design enforces the principle that no analysis should happen without that analysis being prespecified in code. To this end the platform imposes several important default on users: these all aim to help user produce high quality, openly shared code for health data science.The platform make it impossible for researcher to query any real data without first writing their query a code and saving it in a code repository.The code is automatically tested by the system prior to running. This ensures the code is always in a reproducible state.We provide tool for researcher to precisely reproduce the production environment on their own computer. This minimises the risk of error due to old conflicting version of software, and free them to do most of their development without touching patient data.This clean separation of study design and execution encourages clear, upfront, hypothesis-driven design. Moreover, the fact that every code execution is logged in public make undisclosed impossible.Integration with Github, the popular version control website, encourages best practice around open task management and code review.Because all code and configuration is recorded alongside project initiation documentation (including initial project design, and legal governance documentation), researcher can demonstrate public accountability and participation.Common research task such a data aggregation, case matching, time-based numerator/denominator pairs, low number suppression and statistical summary are provided a library (called actions) that are reusable in any supported language (currently Python, R and Stata). Actions are rigorously tested and improved over time, benefiting the whole community. Anyone can contribute new actions; we are building a rich action library.Variables relating to characteristic of patient are commonly developed around the concept of a code list: a set of code matching clinical term recorded in the database. We have provided that allows researcher to record and publish not only list of codes, but also the logical process they went through to arrive at these lists.The fact that all code is published under an open source license make it possible for researcher to learn from (and build on) each others best practice.All study definition code, codelists, and result released from the platform (with disclosure control applied) are made public by the researcher at or before the time when result are shared and paper are submitted for peer review publication.It is accepted that some code may remain private while an analysis is in development. However, all code is published when the result of the analysis are shared (or, for non-complete projects, a soon a possible, usually at the point of their cessation, and no later than 12 month after any code ha been executed against the raw patient data).In addition, OpenSAFELY is creating a public dashboard listing all approved projects: description of purpose; contact email of researcher; affiliated organisation; when the first code wa executed; link to GitHub repository (the content of which must be made public at the time of result dissemination, if not sooner); and link to published material (supplied by researchers). This is supplementary to the .We are keen to hear feedback on these principles, and learn from open working practice in other projects. Lastly, we are always keen to participate in collaboration and community building that will help sustain the growing productive ecosystem developing around the principle of modern, open, collaborative computational data science.Open Working, Open SharingOpenSAFELY ha been created, with public and charitable funding, for the benefit of population health. All underlying code for the platform is open-source: it can be viewed, evaluated, and re-used freely by all. All analysis code that executes on the platform must also be shared for review and re-use under an , with the being the default.This is in keeping with best practices, including those set out in the : researcher should share their method and code so that other team can review their work, learn from it, and re-use it; researcher should feel safe and confident about publishing pragmatic, imperfect, working code; people developing code for tool and service should ideally work in public from early on in the project where possible.Using OpenSAFELY is a collaborative process. All user are able to review, evaluate and re-use the codelists, code, libraries, documentation and other open resource produced by user who have worked in OpenSAFELY before them. In turn, all user contribute to the development and expansion of the platform a they deliver their own work: for example by contributing to , , user-research, , code libraries, lay summaries, or .While open code is the norm in other discipline - such a physics, or structural genomics - we recognise that open working can raise concern for some user around credit, resource, and reward, especially under current arrangement for research funding. Specifically, we recognise the need for researcher to make their work sustainable by taking credit for work that they themselves have developed, or resourced, and of pressure to publish. We also recognise the shifting norm around the role of research software engineers, and the need for software developer to receive prominent credit for their contribution to papers, since great work in computational data science is only produced by mixed team of developer and researcher working hand in hand. We are running and participating in various project to help develop new norm and mechanism to recognise contribution to code, data acquisition, codelists, and engineering. As an interim, we assume: where bespoke software tools, data, or code are produced or funded for a specific project by a specific team, then it is reasonable to expect that team will have the opportunity to be the first user, notwithstanding long access delay for the wider community; developer contributing to code that delivered an output in OpenSAFELY should be offered authorship, more prominently where substantial new code wa developed bespoke for a specific output; all prior work on codelists, code, data acquisition, and method that are re-used should receive appropriate recognition and attribution. Separately, we hope that OpenSAFELY user will want to participate in community effort around developing new norm that can incentivise and deliver more open and reproducible science in healthcare.FooterOpenSAFELYResearchMoreProjectsBennett Institute for Applied Data ScienceNuffield Dept of Primary Care Health SciencesUniversity of OxfordOxfordOX2 6GGOpenSAFELY is publicly funded with grant from Wellcome Trust, UKRI/MRC, NIHR, and the National Core Studies.

Writing in The Economist, Hal Hodson, explains the significance of the OpenSafely platform from a cultural, regulatory and technical perspective, stating that:In normal circumstances, merely obtaining permission to look at such a trove of sensitive health data would take months, perhaps years, of jumping through hoop held by ethic committees, computer-security checker and so on. Running the analysis and getting it published might take month more. These are not, though, normal circumstances, and in fact it took Opensafely a mere 42 day to go from idea to publication.This open source project is using Python, SQL and Docker to understand coronavirus health data In this article, Jo Best, interview Dr. Ben Goldacre to provide a detailed descriptio and analysis of the technical design of the platform, summarising:To keep NHS patient data a secure a possible, OpenSafely ha shifted from a model based on trust (where trusted researcher are approved to work on raw data) to one more based on proof.Finally!

Covering our factor assocatied with paper, this story focus on the fact that our data confirms males, older people, and those with underlying health condition have a higher risk of COVID-19 death. It feature a quote, from co-PI Professor Liam Smeeth:The answer provided by this OpenSAFELY analysis are of crucial importance to country around the world. For example, it is very concerning to see that the higher risk faced by people from [BAME] background are not attributable to identifiable underlying health conditions.Researchers analyse 17.4 million NHS patient EHRs in the world largest study to date on COVID-19 deaths. Summarising the finding of our factor associated with paper, this article highlight the finding that increased mortality risk for ethnic minority is only partially attributable to pre-existing clinical risk factors. It also note that the study is the largest on COVID-19 conducted by any country to date, and therefore give the strongest evidence on risk factors.Coronavirus: Does being overweight or obese affect how ill people get? This report, focusing on the risk associated with being overweight, cite the finding from our factor associated with paper: a study of NHS electronic health record found a doubling of the risk of dying from Covid-19 among people who were obese.17.4 million GP record analysed in largest COVID-19 study. Summarsing the main finding of the factor associated with paper, this story states: Of the record used in the study there were 5,707 death in hospital attributed to COVID-19, with key factor found to be related to death included being male, older age, uncontrolled diabetes and severe asthma.Coronavirus: Underlying health condition dont explain higher BAME deaths, say scientists. Focusing on the implication of our factor associated with paper for individual from ethnic minority groups, this story quote co-PI Dr. Ben Goldacre:People have very reasonably speculated that the increased risk among BME people might be attributable to them having higher risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and what our very detailed analysis show is that is actually not the case, thats not the explanation. So weve been able to exclude one of the current preferred explanation for why BME people face higher risks, and it wa impossible to do that with the ONS data alone.Black people in England and Wales are four time more likely to die from the coronavirus, data shows. In this story, reporter Haley Ott, again focus on the fact that the factor associated with paper found that once pre-existing health condition had been adjusted for, black and ethnic minority people are still more likely to die from COVID-19 than white people.Largest study to date reveals risk factor for COVID-19 death.

As a microcosm of this we have first explored codelists. There are currently no answer or preferred solution given. We will be holding an open discussion with the research community on 2nd March at 3pm - you can book to join u here.03 December 2020We have been very busy since our last newsletter back in July and there are tonne of exciting update for you here! Measure Update: Total Oral Morphine Equivalence The Faculty of Pain Medicine ha recently updated their recommendation on oral morphine equivalence (OME) which we use on our OpenPrescribing measure of OME. We have taken this opportunity to update and a new novel implementation of how we ass OME. Until this work is completed we have taken the decision to suspend the measure from dashboard however you can still view the old method using this link.07 October 2020This is the code for the OpenSAFELY cohort extractor tool which support the authoring of OpenSAFELY-compliant research, by: Allowing developer to generate random data based on their study expectations. They can then use this a input data when developing analytic models. Supporting downloading of codelist CSVs from the OpenSAFELY codelists repository, for incorporation into the study definition Providing tool to understand and visualise the property of real data, without having direct access to it It is also the mechanism by which cohort are extracted from live database backends within the OpenSAFELY framework.07 October 2020This is the repository for the OpenSAFELY job runner. A job runner is a service that encapsulates: the task of checking out an OpenSAFELY study repo; executing action defined in it project.yaml configuration file when requested via a job queue; and storing it result in a particular locations. The documentation is aimed at developer looking for an overview of how the system works. It also ha some part relevant for end users, particularly the project.07 October 2020This is the code for the OpenSAFELY job server designed for mediating job that can be run in an OpenSAFELY secure environment. The Django app provides a simple REST API which provides a channel for communicating between low-security environment (which can request that job be run) and high-security environment (where job are run).07 October 2020What is OpenSAFELY? Working on behalf of NHS England we have now built a full, open source, highly secure analytics platform running across the full pseudonymised primary care record of 24 million people, rising soon to 55 million, 95% of the population of England. We have pursued a new model: for privacy, security, low cost, and near-real-time data access, we have built the analytics platform inside the EHR data centre of the major EHR providers, where the data already resides; in addition we have built software that us tiered increasingly non-disclosive table to prevent researcher ever needing direct access to the disclosive underlying data to run analyses; code is developed against simulated data using open platform before moving to the live data environment.04 August 2020OpenPrescribing and Bennett Institute Papers It ha been a busy month for paper publication at The Bennett Institute. We have written a brief description of the most recent paper below. Please sharewith colleague and get in touch if you have any relevant observations!

We found that the prevalence of unsafe methotrexate prescribing (10mg tablets) ha reduced but remains common, with substantial variation between practice and CCGs. In the paper we also discus recommendation for better strategy around implementation. Anyone can view the live data on unsafe methotrexate prescribing at openprescribing.28 May 2020OpenSAFELY.org OpenSAFELY is a new secure analytics platform for electronic health record in the NHS, created to deliver urgent result during the global COVID-19 emergency. OpenSAFELY is a collaboration between the Bennett Institute, the EHR group at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and TPP who produce SystmOne. OpenSAFELY is now successfully delivering analysis across more than 24 million patient full pseudonymised primary care NHS records. The first analysis from OpenSAFELY is Factors associated with COVID-19-related hospital death in the linked electronic health record of 17 million adult NHS patient with more answer to important question expected shortly.22 May 2020OpenPrescribing.net ha been updated this week with the latest release of prescribing data covering March 2020. In-depth analysis will be needed over the coming months, but this release give u the first glimpse into the impact that COVID-19 ha had on prescribing. At the Bennett Institute we have been quite busy with the new secure analytics platform OpenSAFELY but the following blog is a rapid analysis of the March prescribing data which others may find helpful to focus their own investigations.FooterOpenSAFELYResearchMoreProjectsBennett Institute for Applied Data ScienceNuffield Dept of Primary Care Health SciencesUniversity of OxfordOxfordOX2 6GGOpenSAFELY is publicly funded with grant from Wellcome Trust, UKRI/MRC, NIHR, and the National Core Studies.

Open menu (current)More (current)More/About OpenSAFELYAbout OpenSAFELYOpenSAFELY is a secure, transparent, open-source software platform for analysis of electronic health record data. All platform activity is publicly logged. All code for data management and analysis is shared, under open license and by default, for scientific review and efficient re-use.OpenSAFELY is a set of best practice encoded a software. It can be deployed to create a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) alongside appropriate database, compute, governance, and administrative elements; or it can be deployed a a privacy-enhancing layer on any existing secure database or TRE.OpenSAFELY software is currently deployed within the secure data centre of the two largest electronic health record provider in the NHS, : thereby creating OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS. We are also deploying OpenSAFELY in other data centre with other NHS partner to support rapid, transparent, and open analytics. Designed to provide secure and federated analytics, OpenSAFELY help the NHS minimise the sharing of confidential patient information.Pseudonymisation and access controlsTo understand the technical design choice of OpenSAFELY, it is helpful to first understand the privacy and disclosure risk which the tool aim to mitigate. Pseudonymisation is a widely used process for protecting patient privacy whereby explicit identifier such a names, addresses, and date of birth are removed from patient medical record before they are used or shared. Pseudonymisation is necessary to protect patient privacy, but it is not a sufficient safeguard on it own. For example, pseudonymisation might help to prevent a researcher accidentally seeing a piece of information about someone they know, flashing past on the screen; but beyond this, it doe very little to preserve privacy. For example, in a comprehensive set of NHS patient records, someone misusing the data could easily find and read Tony Blairs entire health record by searching for a patient who match information that is openly available on his Wikipedia page: his age, the approximate date he wa treated for an abnormal heart rhythm, and the fact that he lived in London.Because this kind of re-identification can be easy, we believe that detailed pseudonymised health data should be handled a if it were identifiable, taking all reasonable technical step to prevent and detect misuse of the data: it should be disseminated a little a possible; accessed in environment that do their best to prevent researcher ever needing to even view the underlying raw data; and managed in a setting where comprehensive log of all action are kept, and ideally shared, in a form where they can be easily reviewed at scale. These technical safeguard should sit alongside the other widely implemented administrative safeguard to scrutinise that the proposed analysis is likely to have public benefit, and to evaluate user and ensure that all analyst accessing data are trustworthy: function that support .Core Design Features for Privacy, Transparency, and Open WorkingOpenSAFELY aim to substantially exceed, by design, the current requirement on securing sensitive healthcare data.OpenSAFELY doe not move patient data outside of the secure environment where it already resides: instead, trusted analyst can run large scale computation across pseudonymised patient record in situ, and in near-real-time.In the case of OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS, we have implemented OpenSAFELY inside the data centre of the largest provider of GP electronic health record software in England, in the location where patient record already reside. This mean that the data never move location. (It also mean that we get to work closely with EHR software developer in these companies, who know their own data extremely well).However this is not the only privacy safeguard. In addition, we do not give user unconstrained access to view and manipulate raw data on a remote machine: instead, user work on the data at arm length using OpenSAFELY services.OpenSAFELY contains a range of flexible, pragmatic, but broadly standardised tool that user work with to convert raw patient data into research ready datasets, and to then execute code across those datasets. Standardising the data management pathway in this way brings numerous benefit around re-usability, efficiency, security, and transparency.All code created for data management and analysis can be shared, informatively, for review and re-use by all subsequent users. In most setting for NHS patient data analysis the same data management task are achieved by a huge range of bespoke and duplicative methods, in a huge range of different tools, with single task often spread between platform or programming languages. In OpenSAFELY the data management is always done the same way, using the same OpenSAFELY tools, so code is created in a form where it can be quickly read, understood, adapted, and re-used by any user for any other data science project.Users are blocked from directly viewing the raw patient data or the research ready datasets, but still write code a if they were in a live data environment. In most other setting analyst write their code, which convert raw data into finished graph and tables, by working directly with (and seeing) the real data, iterating and testing a they go. In OpenSAFELY, the data management tool used to produce their research-ready datasets also produce simulated, randomly generated dummy data that ha the same structure a the real data, but none of the disclosive risks. Every researcher is therefore provided with a where they can build all their data management and analysis code quickly, but only against dummy patient data. This minimises needle interaction with disclosive patient record and allows anyone with technical skill to swifty check and reproduce the methods. Researchers develop all their code for statistical analysis, dashboards, graph and table against this dummy data, using open tool and service like GitHub. Their code is then tested automatically by the OpenSAFELY tools, using the dummy data. When it is capable of running to completion, it is packaged up inside a container, using a tool called Docker. All their data management and analysis code is then sent securely into the live data environment to be executed against the real patient data: researcher can only view their result table and graphs, but no researcher ever need to enter the real patient-data environment, or see the real patient data. It is useful to contrast this against other setting which work with synthetic data (real data, but with statistical noise added in an effort to preserve privacy): they typically require researcher to also use that synthetic data to run their analyses, which can undermine the reliability of the results: in OpenSAFELY the synthetic dummy data is only used for code development, not code execution. In this way we get all the privacy preserving benefit of completely random synthetic data, but also retain all of the analytic benefit that come from executing code against real patient data.All code ever executed against the patient data can be shared, a an informative public log, because none of that code is disclosive of patient data. Normally TREs that execute code against real patient data try to keep a log of activity in the platform, but they cannot share every action in each user session, because the code for data management and analysis wa generated while working directly with the real data, and so there is a substantial risk that the code itself might contain some disclosive information about individual patients. Some platform log screen recordings, or keystrokes, for later review, but these can also never be shared openly, because of the disclosure risk (they are also laborious to review). OpenSAFELY code is only generated by working with dummy data, so we can be certain that it is non-disclosive. This mean it can be shared, and so we do share it: all of it, automatically, in public, and by default. This mean that every interested stakeholder can see what every analyst ha done with patient data inside OpenSAFELY, and all patients, professional and policymakers can be confident that data ha only been used for the purpose for which access wa granted: this is crucial for building trust, and a substantial improvement on the current paradigm whereby TREs only share a list of project with permissions. The removal of privacy risk from data management and analysis code also free up OpenSAFELY code for sharing and re-use under open licenses: it mean that there is no information governance or privacy barrier to user sharing code for others to review, critically evaluate, improve, and re-use, wherever they wish.These working methods, and the code in which they are embodied, mean that OpenSAFELY substantially exceeds current best practice around secure execution of analysis code on pseudonymised patient data, when combined with the other governance feature of a strong TRE. After completion of each analysis, only is released outside the secure environment, such a summary table or figures, after strict disclosivity check and redactions, to ensure . When access to any TRE, including one using OpenSAFELY code, is considered to be appropriate, the dataset described by the study definition should also be justified and proportionate, in accordance with the and the .Broad Collaboration, pooling best practiceOpenSAFELY ha been built a a broad collaboration between a huge range of organisations, and users, each of whom bring unique expertise.The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science at the University of Oxford led on building the software platform, a a mixed team of software developer and traditional academic researchers.The EHR group at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ha decade of deep expertise on working with GP data and other form of NHS electronic health records.TPP and EMIS are electronic health record system supplier covering 58 million patient record in total across England: they have very deep knowledge of electronic health record data, and have provided data infrastructure and other support pro bono for OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic.NHS England and NHSX handle all information governance, permissions, and additional data sources.We also have a growing list of broader collaboration including ICNARC, ISARIC, PHOSP, ONS, the National Core Studies Longitudinal Health team representing a range of cohort studies, and more.Together we represent a large national team of software developers, clinicians, and epidemiologists, all pooling diverse skill and knowledge to deliver high performance, highly secure, and high quality data analysis on NHS records. Our aim is to combine best practice from academia and the open source software development community. We now have a growing community of health data analyst who can speak the same language a software developers, doing pull request and code reviews; and full stack software developer with deep knowledge and understanding of health service and NHS data.The project is led by Ben Goldacre, Director of the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science; Seb Bacon, CTO at the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science; and Liam Smeeth, Director of LSHTM.Transparency and public logsOpenSAFELY doe not rely on an assumption of trust: it aim to be provably trustworthy, and transparent, by providing a full public log of all activity in the platform. This allows patients, professional and the public to hold the entire system accountable, because it their data being used for public benefit. Below are some example of how we drive accountability:All project started within OpenSAFELY are visible to the public. For example, .OpenSAFELY requires all researcher to archive and publish their analytic code: this is the only way they are allowed to run code against real data. For example, ha it , which link to the used to generate the analysis (and a of every version of the code ever run).Every time a researcher want to run this code against real data, in public.Every time a researcher change their code, it is automatically checked in public ( are a record of this), to provide reassurance it can be run without errors.Clinical research isnt only about writing analytic code. It also involves compiling codelists: set of clinical term that define symptoms, investigations, diseases, condition or other action (such a the provision of a referral letter, or a sick note). The OpenSAFELY platform includes for creating and sharing codelists in public; for example, , which includes of how the codelist wa constructed.It is accepted that some code may remain private while an analysis is in development. However, all code is published when the result of the analysis are shared (or, for non-complete projects, a soon a possible, usually at the point of their cessation, and no later than 12 month after any code ha been executed against the raw patient data).The OpenSAFELY commitment to public accountability also extends to how the software is developed. The software is developed on a non-commercial basis by the at the University of Oxford, and is to inspect, and re-use. is published on all aspect of the platform. All the feature development and product support is in .Ethics and IntegrityAs in all other research setting OpenSAFELY user are expected to maintain the highest standard of research integrity a described by, for example, Universities UKs and the . Research project must be scientifically sound and guided by ethical principles: a with all other research work, gaining appropriate research ethic approval is a prerequisite for using the OpenSAFELY platform.All information governance for OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS is handled by NHS England. Research proposal submitted for possible execution in OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS are assessed by NHS England and the OpenSAFELY collaboration in accordance with the process reviewed by the . This ensures that the platform is used for . In OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS code can currently be executed against the full pseudonymised primary care record of over 58 million people, linked onto multiple additional source of person-level data: this is a privilege, made possible by patient and the NHS; the scale of this privilege must never be forgotten. All OpenSAFELY researcher , and be cognisant of their obligation to respect the individual to whom the data relates. The intention, design and process of the research should be appropriately described and justified in a research proposal or protocol, noting that the OpenSAFELY platform can currently only be used to support research that will deliver urgent result related to the .It is important that research team are accountable for delivering on their pre-specified aims: in addition to other mechanism used by the research community to achieve this objective, all activity on OpenSAFELY is clearly logged, leaving a record of every analysis executed by each user. All code is made public at the point that result are shared, if not sooner. All result from OpenSAFELY analysis must be shared within 12 month of execution (a code of conduct we require all researcher to sign up to): this should be regarded a the absolute latest data for sharing, with a clear expectation of rapid dissemination in preprints, reports, and papers.Contributing to best practice around open scienceOpenSAFELY ha been built a a service that aim to embody best practice around open science. In particular, it design enforces the principle that no analysis should happen without that analysis being prespecified in code. To this end the platform imposes several important default on users: these all aim to help user produce high quality, openly shared code for health data science.The platform make it impossible for researcher to query any real data without first writing their query a code and saving it in a code repository.The code is automatically tested by the system prior to running. This ensures the code is always in a reproducible state.We provide tool for researcher to precisely reproduce the production environment on their own computer. This minimises the risk of error due to old conflicting version of software, and free them to do most of their development without touching patient data.This clean separation of study design and execution encourages clear, upfront, hypothesis-driven design. Moreover, the fact that every code execution is logged in public make undisclosed impossible.Integration with Github, the popular version control website, encourages best practice around open task management and code review.Because all code and configuration is recorded alongside project initiation documentation (including initial project design, and legal governance documentation), researcher can demonstrate public accountability and participation.Common research task such a data aggregation, case matching, time-based numerator/denominator pairs, low number suppression and statistical summary are provided a library (called actions) that are reusable in any supported language (currently Python, R and Stata). Actions are rigorously tested and improved over time, benefiting the whole community. Anyone can contribute new actions; we are building a rich action library.Variables relating to characteristic of patient are commonly developed around the concept of a code list: a set of code matching clinical term recorded in the database. We have provided that allows researcher to record and publish not only list of codes, but also the logical process they went through to arrive at these lists.The fact that all code is published under an open source license make it possible for researcher to learn from (and build on) each others best practice.All study definition code, codelists, and result released from the platform (with disclosure control applied) are made public by the researcher at or before the time when result are shared and paper are submitted for peer review publication.It is accepted that some code may remain private while an analysis is in development. However, all code is published when the result of the analysis are shared (or, for non-complete projects, a soon a possible, usually at the point of their cessation, and no later than 12 month after any code ha been executed against the raw patient data).In addition, OpenSAFELY is creating a public dashboard listing all approved projects: description of purpose; contact email of researcher; affiliated organisation; when the first code wa executed; link to GitHub repository (the content of which must be made public at the time of result dissemination, if not sooner); and link to published material (supplied by researchers). This is supplementary to the .We are keen to hear feedback on these principles, and learn from open working practice in other projects. Lastly, we are always keen to participate in collaboration and community building that will help sustain the growing productive ecosystem developing around the principle of modern, open, collaborative computational data science.Open Working, Open SharingOpenSAFELY ha been created, with public and charitable funding, for the benefit of population health. All underlying code for the platform is open-source: it can be viewed, evaluated, and re-used freely by all. All analysis code that executes on the platform must also be shared for review and re-use under an , with the being the default.This is in keeping with best practices, including those set out in the : researcher should share their method and code so that other team can review their work, learn from it, and re-use it; researcher should feel safe and confident about publishing pragmatic, imperfect, working code; people developing code for tool and service should ideally work in public from early on in the project where possible.Using OpenSAFELY is a collaborative process. All user are able to review, evaluate and re-use the codelists, code, libraries, documentation and other open resource produced by user who have worked in OpenSAFELY before them. In turn, all user contribute to the development and expansion of the platform a they deliver their own work: for example by contributing to , , user-research, , code libraries, lay summaries, or .While open code is the norm in other discipline - such a physics, or structural genomics - we recognise that open working can raise concern for some user around credit, resource, and reward, especially under current arrangement for research funding. Specifically, we recognise the need for researcher to make their work sustainable by taking credit for work that they themselves have developed, or resourced, and of pressure to publish. We also recognise the shifting norm around the role of research software engineers, and the need for software developer to receive prominent credit for their contribution to papers, since great work in computational data science is only produced by mixed team of developer and researcher working hand in hand. We are running and participating in various project to help develop new norm and mechanism to recognise contribution to code, data acquisition, codelists, and engineering. As an interim, we assume: where bespoke software tools, data, or code are produced or funded for a specific project by a specific team, then it is reasonable to expect that team will have the opportunity to be the first user, notwithstanding long access delay for the wider community; developer contributing to code that delivered an output in OpenSAFELY should be offered authorship, more prominently where substantial new code wa developed bespoke for a specific output; all prior work on codelists, code, data acquisition, and method that are re-used should receive appropriate recognition and attribution. Separately, we hope that OpenSAFELY user will want to participate in community effort around developing new norm that can incentivise and deliver more open and reproducible science in healthcare.FooterOpenSAFELYResearchMoreProjectsBennett Institute for Applied Data ScienceNuffield Dept of Primary Care Health SciencesUniversity of OxfordOxfordOX2 6GGOpenSAFELY is publicly funded with grant from Wellcome Trust, UKRI/MRC, NIHR, and the National Core Studies.

Open menu (current)More (current)More/About OpenSAFELYAbout OpenSAFELYOpenSAFELY is a secure, transparent, open-source software platform for analysis of electronic health record data. All platform activity is publicly logged. All code for data management and analysis is shared, under open license and by default, for scientific review and efficient re-use.OpenSAFELY is a set of best practice encoded a software. It can be deployed to create a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) alongside appropriate database, compute, governance, and administrative elements; or it can be deployed a a privacy-enhancing layer on any existing secure database or TRE.OpenSAFELY software is currently deployed within the secure data centre of the two largest electronic health record provider in the NHS, : thereby creating OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS. We are also deploying OpenSAFELY in other data centre with other NHS partner to support rapid, transparent, and open analytics. Designed to provide secure and federated analytics, OpenSAFELY help the NHS minimise the sharing of confidential patient information.Pseudonymisation and access controlsTo understand the technical design choice of OpenSAFELY, it is helpful to first understand the privacy and disclosure risk which the tool aim to mitigate. Pseudonymisation is a widely used process for protecting patient privacy whereby explicit identifier such a names, addresses, and date of birth are removed from patient medical record before they are used or shared. Pseudonymisation is necessary to protect patient privacy, but it is not a sufficient safeguard on it own. For example, pseudonymisation might help to prevent a researcher accidentally seeing a piece of information about someone they know, flashing past on the screen; but beyond this, it doe very little to preserve privacy. For example, in a comprehensive set of NHS patient records, someone misusing the data could easily find and read Tony Blairs entire health record by searching for a patient who match information that is openly available on his Wikipedia page: his age, the approximate date he wa treated for an abnormal heart rhythm, and the fact that he lived in London.Because this kind of re-identification can be easy, we believe that detailed pseudonymised health data should be handled a if it were identifiable, taking all reasonable technical step to prevent and detect misuse of the data: it should be disseminated a little a possible; accessed in environment that do their best to prevent researcher ever needing to even view the underlying raw data; and managed in a setting where comprehensive log of all action are kept, and ideally shared, in a form where they can be easily reviewed at scale. These technical safeguard should sit alongside the other widely implemented administrative safeguard to scrutinise that the proposed analysis is likely to have public benefit, and to evaluate user and ensure that all analyst accessing data are trustworthy: function that support .Core Design Features for Privacy, Transparency, and Open WorkingOpenSAFELY aim to substantially exceed, by design, the current requirement on securing sensitive healthcare data.OpenSAFELY doe not move patient data outside of the secure environment where it already resides: instead, trusted analyst can run large scale computation across pseudonymised patient record in situ, and in near-real-time.In the case of OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS, we have implemented OpenSAFELY inside the data centre of the largest provider of GP electronic health record software in England, in the location where patient record already reside. This mean that the data never move location. (It also mean that we get to work closely with EHR software developer in these companies, who know their own data extremely well).However this is not the only privacy safeguard. In addition, we do not give user unconstrained access to view and manipulate raw data on a remote machine: instead, user work on the data at arm length using OpenSAFELY services.OpenSAFELY contains a range of flexible, pragmatic, but broadly standardised tool that user work with to convert raw patient data into research ready datasets, and to then execute code across those datasets. Standardising the data management pathway in this way brings numerous benefit around re-usability, efficiency, security, and transparency.All code created for data management and analysis can be shared, informatively, for review and re-use by all subsequent users. In most setting for NHS patient data analysis the same data management task are achieved by a huge range of bespoke and duplicative methods, in a huge range of different tools, with single task often spread between platform or programming languages. In OpenSAFELY the data management is always done the same way, using the same OpenSAFELY tools, so code is created in a form where it can be quickly read, understood, adapted, and re-used by any user for any other data science project.Users are blocked from directly viewing the raw patient data or the research ready datasets, but still write code a if they were in a live data environment. In most other setting analyst write their code, which convert raw data into finished graph and tables, by working directly with (and seeing) the real data, iterating and testing a they go. In OpenSAFELY, the data management tool used to produce their research-ready datasets also produce simulated, randomly generated dummy data that ha the same structure a the real data, but none of the disclosive risks. Every researcher is therefore provided with a where they can build all their data management and analysis code quickly, but only against dummy patient data. This minimises needle interaction with disclosive patient record and allows anyone with technical skill to swifty check and reproduce the methods. Researchers develop all their code for statistical analysis, dashboards, graph and table against this dummy data, using open tool and service like GitHub. Their code is then tested automatically by the OpenSAFELY tools, using the dummy data. When it is capable of running to completion, it is packaged up inside a container, using a tool called Docker. All their data management and analysis code is then sent securely into the live data environment to be executed against the real patient data: researcher can only view their result table and graphs, but no researcher ever need to enter the real patient-data environment, or see the real patient data. It is useful to contrast this against other setting which work with synthetic data (real data, but with statistical noise added in an effort to preserve privacy): they typically require researcher to also use that synthetic data to run their analyses, which can undermine the reliability of the results: in OpenSAFELY the synthetic dummy data is only used for code development, not code execution. In this way we get all the privacy preserving benefit of completely random synthetic data, but also retain all of the analytic benefit that come from executing code against real patient data.All code ever executed against the patient data can be shared, a an informative public log, because none of that code is disclosive of patient data. Normally TREs that execute code against real patient data try to keep a log of activity in the platform, but they cannot share every action in each user session, because the code for data management and analysis wa generated while working directly with the real data, and so there is a substantial risk that the code itself might contain some disclosive information about individual patients. Some platform log screen recordings, or keystrokes, for later review, but these can also never be shared openly, because of the disclosure risk (they are also laborious to review). OpenSAFELY code is only generated by working with dummy data, so we can be certain that it is non-disclosive. This mean it can be shared, and so we do share it: all of it, automatically, in public, and by default. This mean that every interested stakeholder can see what every analyst ha done with patient data inside OpenSAFELY, and all patients, professional and policymakers can be confident that data ha only been used for the purpose for which access wa granted: this is crucial for building trust, and a substantial improvement on the current paradigm whereby TREs only share a list of project with permissions. The removal of privacy risk from data management and analysis code also free up OpenSAFELY code for sharing and re-use under open licenses: it mean that there is no information governance or privacy barrier to user sharing code for others to review, critically evaluate, improve, and re-use, wherever they wish.These working methods, and the code in which they are embodied, mean that OpenSAFELY substantially exceeds current best practice around secure execution of analysis code on pseudonymised patient data, when combined with the other governance feature of a strong TRE. After completion of each analysis, only is released outside the secure environment, such a summary table or figures, after strict disclosivity check and redactions, to ensure . When access to any TRE, including one using OpenSAFELY code, is considered to be appropriate, the dataset described by the study definition should also be justified and proportionate, in accordance with the and the .Broad Collaboration, pooling best practiceOpenSAFELY ha been built a a broad collaboration between a huge range of organisations, and users, each of whom bring unique expertise.The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science at the University of Oxford led on building the software platform, a a mixed team of software developer and traditional academic researchers.The EHR group at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ha decade of deep expertise on working with GP data and other form of NHS electronic health records.TPP and EMIS are electronic health record system supplier covering 58 million patient record in total across England: they have very deep knowledge of electronic health record data, and have provided data infrastructure and other support pro bono for OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic.NHS England and NHSX handle all information governance, permissions, and additional data sources.We also have a growing list of broader collaboration including ICNARC, ISARIC, PHOSP, ONS, the National Core Studies Longitudinal Health team representing a range of cohort studies, and more.Together we represent a large national team of software developers, clinicians, and epidemiologists, all pooling diverse skill and knowledge to deliver high performance, highly secure, and high quality data analysis on NHS records. Our aim is to combine best practice from academia and the open source software development community. We now have a growing community of health data analyst who can speak the same language a software developers, doing pull request and code reviews; and full stack software developer with deep knowledge and understanding of health service and NHS data.The project is led by Ben Goldacre, Director of the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science; Seb Bacon, CTO at the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science; and Liam Smeeth, Director of LSHTM.Transparency and public logsOpenSAFELY doe not rely on an assumption of trust: it aim to be provably trustworthy, and transparent, by providing a full public log of all activity in the platform. This allows patients, professional and the public to hold the entire system accountable, because it their data being used for public benefit. Below are some example of how we drive accountability:All project started within OpenSAFELY are visible to the public. For example, .OpenSAFELY requires all researcher to archive and publish their analytic code: this is the only way they are allowed to run code against real data. For example, ha it , which link to the used to generate the analysis (and a of every version of the code ever run).Every time a researcher want to run this code against real data, in public.Every time a researcher change their code, it is automatically checked in public ( are a record of this), to provide reassurance it can be run without errors.Clinical research isnt only about writing analytic code. It also involves compiling codelists: set of clinical term that define symptoms, investigations, diseases, condition or other action (such a the provision of a referral letter, or a sick note). The OpenSAFELY platform includes for creating and sharing codelists in public; for example, , which includes of how the codelist wa constructed.It is accepted that some code may remain private while an analysis is in development. However, all code is published when the result of the analysis are shared (or, for non-complete projects, a soon a possible, usually at the point of their cessation, and no later than 12 month after any code ha been executed against the raw patient data).The OpenSAFELY commitment to public accountability also extends to how the software is developed. The software is developed on a non-commercial basis by the at the University of Oxford, and is to inspect, and re-use. is published on all aspect of the platform. All the feature development and product support is in .Ethics and IntegrityAs in all other research setting OpenSAFELY user are expected to maintain the highest standard of research integrity a described by, for example, Universities UKs and the . Research project must be scientifically sound and guided by ethical principles: a with all other research work, gaining appropriate research ethic approval is a prerequisite for using the OpenSAFELY platform.All information governance for OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS is handled by NHS England. Research proposal submitted for possible execution in OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS are assessed by NHS England and the OpenSAFELY collaboration in accordance with the process reviewed by the .

When access to any TRE, including one using OpenSAFELY code, is considered to be appropriate, the dataset described by the study definition should also be justified and proportionate, in accordance with the and the .Broad Collaboration, pooling best practiceOpenSAFELY ha been built a a broad collaboration between a huge range of organisations, and users, each of whom bring unique expertise.The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science at the University of Oxford led on building the software platform, a a mixed team of software developer and traditional academic researchers.The EHR group at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ha decade of deep expertise on working with GP data and other form of NHS electronic health records.TPP and EMIS are electronic health record system supplier covering 58 million patient record in total across England: they have very deep knowledge of electronic health record data, and have provided data infrastructure and other support pro bono for OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic.NHS England and NHSX handle all information governance, permissions, and additional data sources.We also have a growing list of broader collaboration including ICNARC, ISARIC, PHOSP, ONS, the National Core Studies Longitudinal Health team representing a range of cohort studies, and more.Together we represent a large national team of software developers, clinicians, and epidemiologists, all pooling diverse skill and knowledge to deliver high performance, highly secure, and high quality data analysis on NHS records. Our aim is to combine best practice from academia and the open source software development community. We now have a growing community of health data analyst who can speak the same language a software developers, doing pull request and code reviews; and full stack software developer with deep knowledge and understanding of health service and NHS data.The project is led by Ben Goldacre, Director of the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science; Seb Bacon, CTO at the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science; and Liam Smeeth, Director of LSHTM.Transparency and public logsOpenSAFELY doe not rely on an assumption of trust: it aim to be provably trustworthy, and transparent, by providing a full public log of all activity in the platform. This allows patients, professional and the public to hold the entire system accountable, because it their data being used for public benefit. Below are some example of how we drive accountability:All project started within OpenSAFELY are visible to the public. For example, .OpenSAFELY requires all researcher to archive and publish their analytic code: this is the only way they are allowed to run code against real data. For example, ha it , which link to the used to generate the analysis (and a of every version of the code ever run).Every time a researcher want to run this code against real data, in public.Every time a researcher change their code, it is automatically checked in public ( are a record of this), to provide reassurance it can be run without errors.Clinical research isnt only about writing analytic code. It also involves compiling codelists: set of clinical term that define symptoms, investigations, diseases, condition or other action (such a the provision of a referral letter, or a sick note). The OpenSAFELY platform includes for creating and sharing codelists in public; for example, , which includes of how the codelist wa constructed.It is accepted that some code may remain private while an analysis is in development. However, all code is published when the result of the analysis are shared (or, for non-complete projects, a soon a possible, usually at the point of their cessation, and no later than 12 month after any code ha been executed against the raw patient data).The OpenSAFELY commitment to public accountability also extends to how the software is developed. The software is developed on a non-commercial basis by the at the University of Oxford, and is to inspect, and re-use. is published on all aspect of the platform. All the feature development and product support is in .Ethics and IntegrityAs in all other research setting OpenSAFELY user are expected to maintain the highest standard of research integrity a described by, for example, Universities UKs and the . Research project must be scientifically sound and guided by ethical principles: a with all other research work, gaining appropriate research ethic approval is a prerequisite for using the OpenSAFELY platform.All information governance for OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS is handled by NHS England. Research proposal submitted for possible execution in OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS are assessed by NHS England and the OpenSAFELY collaboration in accordance with the process reviewed by the . This ensures that the platform is used for . In OpenSAFELY-TPP and OpenSAFELY-EMIS code can currently be executed against the full pseudonymised primary care record of over 58 million people, linked onto multiple additional source of person-level data: this is a privilege, made possible by patient and the NHS; the scale of this privilege must never be forgotten. All OpenSAFELY researcher , and be cognisant of their obligation to respect the individual to whom the data relates. The intention, design and process of the research should be appropriately described and justified in a research proposal or protocol, noting that the OpenSAFELY platform can currently only be used to support research that will deliver urgent result related to the .It is important that research team are accountable for delivering on their pre-specified aims: in addition to other mechanism used by the research community to achieve this objective, all activity on OpenSAFELY is clearly logged, leaving a record of every analysis executed by each user. All code is made public at the point that result are shared, if not sooner. All result from OpenSAFELY analysis must be shared within 12 month of execution (a code of conduct we require all researcher to sign up to): this should be regarded a the absolute latest data for sharing, with a clear expectation of rapid dissemination in preprints, reports, and papers.Contributing to best practice around open scienceOpenSAFELY ha been built a a service that aim to embody best practice around open science. In particular, it design enforces the principle that no analysis should happen without that analysis being prespecified in code. To this end the platform imposes several important default on users: these all aim to help user produce high quality, openly shared code for health data science.The platform make it impossible for researcher to query any real data without first writing their query a code and saving it in a code repository.The code is automatically tested by the system prior to running. This ensures the code is always in a reproducible state.We provide tool for researcher to precisely reproduce the production environment on their own computer. This minimises the risk of error due to old conflicting version of software, and free them to do most of their development without touching patient data.This clean separation of study design and execution encourages clear, upfront, hypothesis-driven design. Moreover, the fact that every code execution is logged in public make undisclosed impossible.Integration with Github, the popular version control website, encourages best practice around open task management and code review.Because all code and configuration is recorded alongside project initiation documentation (including initial project design, and legal governance documentation), researcher can demonstrate public accountability and participation.Common research task such a data aggregation, case matching, time-based numerator/denominator pairs, low number suppression and statistical summary are provided a library (called actions) that are reusable in any supported language (currently Python, R and Stata). Actions are rigorously tested and improved over time, benefiting the whole community. Anyone can contribute new actions; we are building a rich action library.Variables relating to characteristic of patient are commonly developed around the concept of a code list: a set of code matching clinical term recorded in the database. We have provided that allows researcher to record and publish not only list of codes, but also the logical process they went through to arrive at these lists.The fact that all code is published under an open source license make it possible for researcher to learn from (and build on) each others best practice.All study definition code, codelists, and result released from the platform (with disclosure control applied) are made public by the researcher at or before the time when result are shared and paper are submitted for peer review publication.It is accepted that some code may remain private while an analysis is in development. However, all code is published when the result of the analysis are shared (or, for non-complete projects, a soon a possible, usually at the point of their cessation, and no later than 12 month after any code ha been executed against the raw patient data).In addition, OpenSAFELY is creating a public dashboard listing all approved projects: description of purpose; contact email of researcher; affiliated organisation; when the first code wa executed; link to GitHub repository (the content of which must be made public at the time of result dissemination, if not sooner); and link to published material (supplied by researchers). This is supplementary to the .We are keen to hear feedback on these principles, and learn from open working practice in other projects. Lastly, we are always keen to participate in collaboration and community building that will help sustain the growing productive ecosystem developing around the principle of modern, open, collaborative computational data science.Open Working, Open SharingOpenSAFELY ha been created, with public and charitable funding, for the benefit of population health. All underlying code for the platform is open-source: it can be viewed, evaluated, and re-used freely by all. All analysis code that executes on the platform must also be shared for review and re-use under an , with the being the default.This is in keeping with best practices, including those set out in the : researcher should share their method and code so that other team can review their work, learn from it, and re-use it; researcher should feel safe and confident about publishing pragmatic, imperfect, working code; people developing code for tool and service should ideally work in public from early on in the project where possible.Using OpenSAFELY is a collaborative process. All user are able to review, evaluate and re-use the codelists, code, libraries, documentation and other open resource produced by user who have worked in OpenSAFELY before them. In turn, all user contribute to the development and expansion of the platform a they deliver their own work: for example by contributing to , , user-research, , code libraries, lay summaries, or .While open code is the norm in other discipline - such a physics, or structural genomics - we recognise that open working can raise concern for some user around credit, resource, and reward, especially under current arrangement for research funding. Specifically, we recognise the need for researcher to make their work sustainable by taking credit for work that they themselves have developed, or resourced, and of pressure to publish. We also recognise the shifting norm around the role of research software engineers, and the need for software developer to receive prominent credit for their contribution to papers, since great work in computational data science is only produced by mixed team of developer and researcher working hand in hand. We are running and participating in various project to help develop new norm and mechanism to recognise contribution to code, data acquisition, codelists, and engineering. As an interim, we assume: where bespoke software tools, data, or code are produced or funded for a specific project by a specific team, then it is reasonable to expect that team will have the opportunity to be the first user, notwithstanding long access delay for the wider community; developer contributing to code that delivered an output in OpenSAFELY should be offered authorship, more prominently where substantial new code wa developed bespoke for a specific output; all prior work on codelists, code, data acquisition, and method that are re-used should receive appropriate recognition and attribution. Separately, we hope that OpenSAFELY user will want to participate in community effort around developing new norm that can incentivise and deliver more open and reproducible science in healthcare.FooterOpenSAFELYResearchMoreProjectsBennett Institute for Applied Data ScienceNuffield Dept of Primary Care Health SciencesUniversity of OxfordOxfordOX2 6GGOpenSAFELY is publicly funded with grant from Wellcome Trust, UKRI/MRC, NIHR, and the National Core Studies.

Open menuMoreMore/Onboarding new user to OpenSAFELYOnboarding new user to OpenSAFELYThis technical document describes our approach to the first wave of additional pilot user for OpenSAFELY, a new open source platform for EHR research with unprecedented security and support for open science. OpenSAFELY can currently execute analysis code across primary care EHR data for over 58 million patient in TPP and EMIS, linked onto SUS, ONS, ICNARC, ECDS, SGSS and other datasets. You can read more about the technical and security model in our paper and in our technical manual which are shared online .Onboarding new user to OpenSAFELY is more complex than granting a simple data download, or a login and password, because, for security and privacy reasons, OpenSAFELY is very different to other approach for EHR data analysis. The platform doe not give researcher unconstrained access to view large volume of pseudonymised and disclosive patient data, either via download or via a remote desktop. Instead we have produced a series of open source tool that enable researcher to use flexible, pragmatic, but standardised approach to process raw electronic health record data into research ready datasets, and to check that this ha been done correctly, without needing to access the patient data directly. Using this data management framework we also generate bespoke dummy datasets. These dummy datasets are used by researcher to develop analysis code in the open, using GitHub. When their data management and data analysis script are capable of running to completion, and passing all test in the OpenSAFELY framework, they are finally sent through to be executed against the real data inside the secure environment, using the OpenSAFELY job runner, inside a container using Docker, without the researcher needing access to that raw potentially disclosive pseudonymised data themselves. The non-disclosive summary results, output tables, logs, and graph are then manually reviewed, a in other systems, before release.This new and highly secure approach afforded by the OpenSAFELY platform ha meant NHS England (the data controller) ha been able to provide access, cautiously, to an unprecedented scale of data for Covid-19 related analyses. It does, however, mean that new user currently need strong computational data science skills, beyond those needed to write statistical analysis script against local data in Python, R or Stata. However, our approach also mean that every analysis executed on OpenSAFELY automatically contributes to a growing library of re-usable codelists, variables, and code, rather than unpredictable folder of arbitrary data management and analysis script in Python, R and SQL. Furthermore it allows u to efficiently address important strategic and analytic challenge such a minimally disclosive linkage, federated analysis, automated monitoring of disclosiveness, and transparent reporting on all analyses. Lastly, alongside this development work, we are also beginning to implement OpenSAFELY in other environment and against new datasets, so that others can take advantage of the benefit of curation a you go, our privacy augmentation, and our shared open source codebase.Next stepsWe have set out to create an open source platform for EHR research where researcher can work independently, using the tool and data (with appropriate permissions) without necessarily needing substantial engagement with our team. Increasingly we will also produce tool that do not require advanced data science skills, to support a wider range of users.As part of building that resource for the community, we are currently working with NHS England to cautiously on-board a small number of external pilot user to develop their analysis on OpenSAFELY. This first wave of pilot user will be collaborators, working closely alongside u to co-develop the platform. Because OpenSAFELY is more than a simple data download or remote desktop service, this first wave of external pilot user need to have substantial existing computational data science skills, and strong experience of working with primary care electronic health record data. They must also be keen to work closely with u to co-develop the OpenSAFELY platform for the community, a described in our document. In turn, a with all those using and contributing to the platform, they will share the credit a the , , and are increasingly widely used. During this pilot phase we will be developing our software and approach for external users.Below we have posted a brief summary of what we can offer to our initial wave of pilot users, and what we would like back from them to support the growth of this open platform. This list is aimed to facilitate discussion a we move cautiously forward to identify new user and collaborator to deliver a thriving open source ecosystem for computational data science on electronic health records, alongside high quality research during the pandemic. Because of limited financial resources, and the need for caution in the pilot phase of this work, we can only accommodate a small number of user until we expand our team. Please note all potential new user and their analysis proposal will also need to be discussed with NHS England who are the Data Controller.What we can offer to pilot OpenSAFELY usersAccess to the platform and, more specifically: help in working with NHSX and NHS England to determine what level of access you will need to the data, and how this can best be facilitated.Guidance and support on using the OpenSAFELY cohort extractor, OpenCodelists and OpenSAFELY job runner to deliver analyses. To help u manage workload with a small growing team this will ideally be through a series of prearranged, intensive, one-week support windows.Help using your existing skill around code sharing, annotation, version control and git in an OpenSAFELY context; and additional software skill development from working with our developer and developer-researchers on the platform.Recognition a part of the OpenSAFELY platform team.What we would like from our work with new pilot usersClose energetic collaboration:A solid period of near-full-time commitment from each person where we are investing effort to train, on-board, and support them.Commitment to finish the planned research project within a specific time, to ensure pace and delivery.Energetic contribution to open code and the platform including:Contribution to Codelists.Contribution to documentation, especially on new feature created to support your work, or in collaboration with you.Detailed feedback on the platform.Feedback on the on-boarding process.Contribution to blog post and similar on relevant aspect of the platform or your work.Working in line with the .High-quality researchWhat we will look for in potential new pilot usersHigh quality research proposal and track record and, more specifically: alignment with COVID-19 research priorities, in line with the and our own team priorities.Strong existing EHR research skills, and a track record of delivery with NHS EHR data.Strong computational data science skill including version control, git, and GitHub.A proven track record on reproducible open science (this is extremely important) including: GitHub repository demonstrating a track record of sharing EHR analysis code openly; adequate documentation for this prior code; and ideally evidence of helping others to re-use your code or data.A strong existing understanding of how OpenSAFELY works, from reading our documentation and codebase.A project whose additional resource requirement from the platform are realistic.A strong understanding of Information Governance.We have already identified a range of pilot users, and are now in close discussion with NHS England on specific analyses; however we will update with progress a our resource and the work develops further.FooterOpenSAFELYResearchMoreProjectsBennett Institute for Applied Data ScienceNuffield Dept of Primary Care Health SciencesUniversity of OxfordOxfordOX2 6GGOpenSAFELY is publicly funded with grant from Wellcome Trust, UKRI/MRC, NIHR, and the National Core Studies.

As a microcosm of this we have first explored codelists. There are currently no answer or preferred solution given. We will be holding an open discussion with the research community on 2nd March at 3pm - you can book to join u here.03 December 2020We have been very busy since our last newsletter back in July and there are tonne of exciting update for you here! Measure Update: Total Oral Morphine Equivalence The Faculty of Pain Medicine ha recently updated their recommendation on oral morphine equivalence (OME) which we use on our OpenPrescribing measure of OME. We have taken this opportunity to update and a new novel implementation of how we ass OME. Until this work is completed we have taken the decision to suspend the measure from dashboard however you can still view the old method using this link.07 October 2020This is the code for the OpenSAFELY cohort extractor tool which support the authoring of OpenSAFELY-compliant research, by: Allowing developer to generate random data based on their study expectations. They can then use this a input data when developing analytic models. Supporting downloading of codelist CSVs from the OpenSAFELY codelists repository, for incorporation into the study definition Providing tool to understand and visualise the property of real data, without having direct access to it It is also the mechanism by which cohort are extracted from live database backends within the OpenSAFELY framework.07 October 2020This is the repository for the OpenSAFELY job runner. A job runner is a service that encapsulates: the task of checking out an OpenSAFELY study repo; executing action defined in it project.yaml configuration file when requested via a job queue; and storing it result in a particular locations. The documentation is aimed at developer looking for an overview of how the system works. It also ha some part relevant for end users, particularly the project.07 October 2020This is the code for the OpenSAFELY job server designed for mediating job that can be run in an OpenSAFELY secure environment. The Django app provides a simple REST API which provides a channel for communicating between low-security environment (which can request that job be run) and high-security environment (where job are run).07 October 2020What is OpenSAFELY? Working on behalf of NHS England we have now built a full, open source, highly secure analytics platform running across the full pseudonymised primary care record of 24 million people, rising soon to 55 million, 95% of the population of England. We have pursued a new model: for privacy, security, low cost, and near-real-time data access, we have built the analytics platform inside the EHR data centre of the major EHR providers, where the data already resides; in addition we have built software that us tiered increasingly non-disclosive table to prevent researcher ever needing direct access to the disclosive underlying data to run analyses; code is developed against simulated data using open platform before moving to the live data environment.04 August 2020OpenPrescribing and Bennett Institute Papers It ha been a busy month for paper publication at The Bennett Institute.

We found that the prevalence of unsafe methotrexate prescribing (10mg tablets) ha reduced but remains common, with substantial variation between practice and CCGs. In the paper we also discus recommendation for better strategy around implementation. Anyone can view the live data on unsafe methotrexate prescribing at openprescribing.28 May 2020OpenSAFELY.org OpenSAFELY is a new secure analytics platform for electronic health record in the NHS, created to deliver urgent result during the global COVID-19 emergency. OpenSAFELY is a collaboration between the Bennett Institute, the EHR group at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and TPP who produce SystmOne. OpenSAFELY is now successfully delivering analysis across more than 24 million patient full pseudonymised primary care NHS records. The first analysis from OpenSAFELY is Factors associated with COVID-19-related hospital death in the linked electronic health record of 17 million adult NHS patient with more answer to important question expected shortly.22 May 2020OpenPrescribing.net ha been updated this week with the latest release of prescribing data covering March 2020. In-depth analysis will be needed over the coming months, but this release give u the first glimpse into the impact that COVID-19 ha had on prescribing.

DOI: 10.3399/BJGP.2021.0376 DOI Preprint Categories Abstract Background On 8 December 2020 NHS England administered the first COVID-19 vaccination. This study aimed to describe trend and variation in vaccine coverage in different clinical and demographic group in the first 100 day of the vaccine rollout. Methods With the approval of NHS England, a cohort study wa conducted of 57.9 million patient record in general practice in England, in situ and within the infrastructure of the electronic health record software vendor EMIS and TPP using OpenSAFELY. Vaccine coverage across various subgroup of Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) priority cohort is described. Results A total of 20 852 692 patient (36.0%) received a vaccine between 8 December 2020 and 17 March 2021. Of patient aged 80 year not in a care home (JCVI group 2) 94.7% received a vaccine, but with substantial variation by ethnicity (White 96.2%, Black 68.3%) and deprivation (least deprived 96.6%, most deprived 90.7%). Patients with pre-existing medical condition were more likely to be vaccinated with two exceptions: severe mental illness (89.5%) and learning disability (91.4%). There were 275 205 vaccine recipient who were identified a care home resident (JCVI group 1; 91.2% coverage). By 17 March, 1 257 914 (6.0%) recipient had a second dose. Conclusions The NHS rapidly delivered mass vaccination. In this study a data-monitoring framework wa deployed using publicly auditable method and a secure in situ processing model, using linked but pseudonymised patient-level NHS data for 57.9 million patients. Targeted activity may be needed to address lower vaccination coverage observed among certain key groups.

We suggest you check it regularly.Last updated: 01 March 2024 New ordering of workspace on OpenSAFELY Jobs homepageUpdated: 01 March 2024What ha changed?Once logged into , the 5 workspace shown to you on your home page are now the five most recently active (by creation/modification date or most recently run job) that you have access to. This is a change from previously showing you the five most recently created.What doe this mean for me?For most user with a small number of workspaces, this change in ordering will likely have little effect. For those with access to many workspaces, this will hopefully make it easier to get access to the most relevant workspace a quickly a possible.Pull request: Comparing study code on OpenSAFELY JobsUpdated: 28 February 2024 ha always shown the Git commit hash for a given job request or job, with a link to view the workspace code on GitHub a of that revision. We now also provide GitHub code comparison link () so you can see exactly what code ha changed between this revision and previous versions.Job RequestsThe code comparison link can be found on a job request page in the Code comparison section beneath the job information. If this is the first job request for this workspace on this backend, no code comparison is possible and so no link is available. If there are previous job requests, a link to compare the workspace code for this job request to the previous, and previous successful run (if present) will be present.JobsThe code comparison link can be found on a job page at the bottom of the Job information section. If this is the first run of this action in this workspace on this backend, no code comparison is possible. If it ha been run before, link to compare the workspace code for this job to the previous, and previous successful run (if present) will be present.N.B. If there lot of change between version of a workspace codebase, the code comparison for a job may also include change that are not directly related to the job in question. Identification of the job by it action name in the project.yaml file and examination of change to related file listed in it configuration should reveal what the relevant change are.Pull request: Markdown formatting of Project Status DescriptionUpdated: 26 February 2024Users can now use to update the Status Description field in the Project page.ScreenshotsExample URLsPull request: ehrQL v1 releasedUpdated: 11 December 2023We have released v1 of .It contains a small number of breaking change from v0.For existing user of ehrQL, please refer to the for guidance about updating from v0.Thank you to all user who have tried out ehrQL and given u feedback! ehrQLs measure framework ha disclosure control enabled by defaultUpdated: 27 November 2023ehrQLs measure framework is used to calculate quotient (i.e. a numerator divided by a denominator) and to see how these vary over time and when broken down by different groupings.Previously, numerator and denominator were not subject to disclosure control: a user had to apply disclosure control by writing their own downstream action. Now, ehrQLs measure framework ha disclosure control enabled by default. First, value le than or equal to seven are replaced with zero (suppressed); then, value are rounded to the nearest five.When the built-in disclosure control method is unhelpful, such a when an alternative method is required or when unsuppressed/unrounded value are needed by a downstream action, allows a user to disable disclosure control. For example:measures = create_measures() measures.configure_disclosure_control(enabled=False) measures.define_measure(...) For more information about disclosure control in OpenSAFELY, please see the page.As always, if you need help with ehrQL, then please ask for help on the Slack channel. (If youre unsure how to join, then please ask your co-pilot.)Pull request: Warn about invalid moderately_sensitive outputsUpdated: 14 November 2023The ha been updated to warn you if you have invalid output marked a moderately_sensitive in your project.yaml. This is a follow on from the and mean that youll get more accurate feedback when running the code locally.Specifically, it will check that moderately_sensitive output meet the appropriate .These currently are:The file must be of the correct type. You will not be able to run job locally at all or on the server if the file is not a valid type, i.e. it must have a valid file extension.If it is a .csv file, it must not have a patient_id column. Your code will still run, but the log file and the on-screen summary text will show a warning. If you run it on your own computer using the opensafely command line tool, you will still get an output. If you run it in the live system via jobs.opensafely.org, then it will still run, but the file will not be available in level 4If it is too large, it will be handled in the same way a above. This is unlikey to occur when running locally against dummy data, but may happen when run via jobs.opensafely.org.Fixing these is likely a case of marking the file a highly_sensitive instead. If you do need it to be moderately_sensitive, then you may need to process the data a bit more, e.g. remove the patient_id column or reduce the size.As a reminder, the policy for moderately_sensitive senstitive output is that they . These check are designed to catch accidental misclassification of output with patient level data a moderately_sensitive.Any question or problems, please let u know. Stricter output path in project.yamlUpdated: 07 November 2023Weve made some change to slightly restrict output file paths.Specifically, all path must now end with file extension, e.g. .csv. Previously, it wa possibly to use a trailing * character to match all file (e.g. outputs/data.*). You can still use * to match group of similar files, but you must end the pattern with a file extension (e.g. outputs/data*.csv).Nearly all project.yaml file do already have explicit file extension in all their output paths, and this will not require any change for most users. There are a few user who may need to add an explicit file extension in order for job to run, both locally and on backends. The that you run locally ha been updated, and it will warn you that you need to do this.There are multiple motivation for this change, but the main one is that we want to be able to inspect the file type when loading a project.yaml. This allows u to warn user if they are trying to mark an a moderately_sensitive.It also stop accidentally capturing output file that were not intended to be output (which incurrs a performance and disk space cost).Any question or problems, please let u know. Updated package in R imageUpdated: 22 September 2023In order to add a new package to the R Docker image we had to upgrade some of the existing package versions. Hopefully these upgrade will be welcome but there a small possibility they might cause issue with existing code so please be on the look out for this.The most significant upgrade is of the readr package from 1.3.1 to 2.1.4. You can find the changelog here: You can see the full list of upgraded package on Github here: Automatically run failed dependency when submitting jobsUpdated: 19 September 2023Previously, when submitting job to run the platform would reject request if any of the requested action dependency had previously failed.This required user to explicitly request those failed dependency to be re-run. This wa cumbersome, and wa not the same behaviour a when running action locally on user machine with the opensafely run command.We have now changed this behaviour, so that if you submit an action to run, any dependent action that have previously failed will also be scheduled to run. This should make submitting job simpler in many cases.For context, the original design for this behaviour wa to encourage user to ensure their code run succesfully locally before submitting to run for real. This avoids overloading the system with job that may fail anyway due to code errors. This is still a very important best practice what we strongly encourage user to do before submitting jobs.However, this resulted in an awkward workflow for submitting batch of jobs, hence this change. Updated disclosure control guidanceUpdated: 18 September 2023We have recently made some update to our disclosure control guidance. This is important for both researcher requesting release of output and those who review them. We have made the following changes, which are summarised in more detail below:Pull request: User, project, and organisation Event Logs addedUpdated: 05 September 2023OpenSAFELY Jobs ha been updated with new Event Log page for users, projects, and organisations.These page provide specific information about current Job Requests, and allow user to see a complete audit log of all previous Job Requests.Examples of new Event Log page include:The global ha also been updated to match the other Event Log pages, and contains a complete log of all Job Requests ever run by OpenSAFELY across all Backends.As a user of the Job Server, you can access your own Event Log page from your dashboard. New opensafely clean commandUpdated: 12 April 2023We have added a command to the : opensafely cleanThis command will safely remove any leftover OpenSAFELY docker artifact from your system. Specifically, it remove old images, job containers, and file volume that may have been created when running job locally on a user computer.Users who have Docker runnng on WSL may find this particularly useful, a it look like removing these leftover artifact can help reduce memory usage.The documentation ha more information on . Improved access to OpenSAFELY Jobs from secure environmentsUpdated: 06 April 2023OpenSAFELY Jobs is used by researcher from within the secure environment (such a TPP level 4) to support the review and output checking of files.Weve added an easier way for user to log in to OpenSAFELY Jobs from the TPP secure environment, by implementing auto-generated single use tokens. Previously, user were required to manually type their Github password and 2FA token, which wa too easy to get wrong.To use this new method, user first generate a single use token by going to their and clicking on the Generate Single Use Token button. Then, they log in a normal to TPP level 4 over the VPN and open a browser window pointing at the . They are now able to authenticate to OpenSAFELY Jobs using just their username or email and the single use token. Much quicker while still being highly secure! Updates to the OpenSAFELY Jobs home pageUpdated: 27 March 2023 home page ha been updated to create a personalised dashboard for users.Once logged in, user will now be able to view:The most recent job request they have createdWorkspaces they have access toMost recently updated projectsIn progress and completed application formsAlongside the new home page, user are now able to access a personalised list of:For visitor to the website who dont have an account, a new home page is visible containing information on why they might want to use OpenSAFELY for their next research project. Introducing the opensafely exec command for interactive sessions.Updated: 16 February 2023New opensafely command: opensafely execThere is new opensafely exec command in recent version of the opensafely tool. It is designed to aid in development of analysis code using the published OpenSAFELY docker images.The need to add your your work-in-progress code to project.yaml in order to test it is awkward. This lead some user to use their own locally installed R/python/stata tooling to develop their code. However, this mean they may end up inadventantly using a library (or version of library) which is not available in the relevant OpenSAFELY image, and then the code fails when running with project.yaml.We previously added the opensafely jupyter to help improve this workflow when working with Jupyter notebooks, but with opensafely exec, weve extended this support to other tools.What doe it do?Running opensafely exec IMAGE COMMAND doe the following:runs the relevant docker IMAGE (r, python, stata-mp, cohortextractor)shares the file in your current directoryexecutes COMMAND (or the default command for the image if you dont supply one)This might sound fairly simple, but it open up some convenient new workflows.ExamplesTo run an interactive R session in your current directory, just do:opensafely exec r R This will start the opensafely R image, run R, and make the file in your current directory available to you. So you can load, test, and develop against your current code and data locally, and save your changes. Itll even save your R workspace if you want it to.For python, you might like to run an interactive ipython session:opensafely exec python ipython And similarly for stata:opensafely exec stata-mp You can also run cohortextractor directly, which can help testing study definitions:opensafely exec cohortextractor --help You can actually run any command you want by passing it a an argument.For example, you can open an interactive bash shell in any of our image with, if you want to look around inside the image:opensafely exec $IMAGE bash For more information, you can run opensafely exec --help, or see Further workWe are always looking for way to make developing with OpenSAFELY tool easier. opensafely exec is a key feature to help acheive this. Using it a a base, some other improvement we may be able to explore in future:An option to confgure Rstudio use the opensafely R image for OpenSAFELY projectsPossibly running the graphical version of StataVSCode integration to run your code automatically with opensafely execTooling to make testing your analysis code much easier.Pull request: New build of the OpenSAFELY R imageUpdated: 15 February 2023New version of the R image publishedWe have just published a new build of the R image. No action needed, but more information below!What ha not changed?This is not a semantic change - the are installed. However the way the image is built ha been reworked, in order to address a number of shortcoming of the previous image, and provide a stonger base to build on in future.What ha changed?We built the new image from a more up-to-date base. This mean a number of core system library have been updated to newer versions. If you want to, you can see the . These are not R libraries, but rather some of the base C library used at a low level. Keeping them up to date is important for security and bug fixes.In addition, weve moved from R 4.0.2 to 4.0.5 to pick up a slew of minor fixes.What doe this mean for me?Hopefully, nothing! The next time you run opensafely pull, downloading the R image may take a bit longer then normal. But otherwise, all your study should run a normal, locally and via jobs.opensafely.org.We have tested the new image with variety of study code without issue, but if you do find something ha changed, please contact and let u know.Who is to blame for this!?Special thanks go to Tom Palmer from the University of Bristol for helping motivate and then exhaustively test the new build process.Pull request: Using compressed data file by defaultUpdated: 02 February 2023Using compressed file is now the default recommendation in documentation and templates. On the backends, where datasets can be very large, using uncompressed file significantly slows execution and consumes more disk space.The ha been updated to generate csv.gz file from cohortextractor by default, and the example and have been updated to match.In addition, recommendation for using compressed format for further data file in .Because of the change in filename, if you have a workspace with a large amount of data in uncompressed CSV files, about moving to compressed CSVs, and we can help do this efficiently. Improve handling of stale medication codelists in cohort-extractorUpdated: 06 January 2023dm+d code for Virtual Medicinal Products (VMPs) can change over time, with the result that codelists that contain VMP code can become stale.As a consequence, study that use patients.with_these_medications() with an old codelist may not have captured all the medication event that the author intended.Until now, the mitigation ha been to review and update codelists manually. With this update, cohort-extractor keep stale medication codelists up-to-date by expanding the original codelist, so that it includes all current and previous code of any VMPs in the codelist. This happens automatically.Note that a codelist containing a VMP and all associated AMPs will still become stale with respect to new AMPs for that VMP are added to dm+d; this case is not currently handled automatically.We will be contacting all study author to explain the potential impact of using stale codelists more widely. Add rounding instruction to disclosure documentationsUpdated: 07 September 2022Added instruction regarding rounding to our disclosure control documentation, including an example.Pull request: Added support for parameterised study definitionsUpdated: 07 September 2022Study definition can now be parameterised so they accept value passed in by the action. This allows multiple cohort with different property to be generated by a single study definition.Pull request: Added support for querying by first and last day of the school yearUpdated: 06 September 2022Added support for querying by first and last day of the (English) school year.Pull request: Added resource management argument to opensafely run commandUpdated: 31 August 2022Users of the OpenSAFELY platform use the opensafely tool to run their code locally prior to running against the real data.This change add some option to control the concurrency and memory usage of running actions, which should help user manage their local resource usage.Pull request: Added with_at_least_one_day_in_critical_care filter to admitted_to_hospitalUpdated: 10 August 2022Added ability to filter a patient hospital admission to only those with at least one day in critical care.Pull request: Platform status pageUpdated: 02 August 2022We have rolled out for the platform. Services on this page will be automatically updated if incident occur. Clarification about referral dataUpdated: 29 June 2022We have clarified in the documentation that data on referral is incomplete. Any codelists which include referral code used with patients.with_these_clinical_events are unlikely to return complete data a it is largely held separately in a difficult-to-analyse format. We hope to offer an alternative data source for referral in due course. Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccination name changeUpdated: 17 June 2022The name of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine ha changed to COVID-19 Vaccine Vaxzevria 0.5ml inj multidose vial (AstraZeneca).

An example use of these region is in .Refer to the heading regarding the general rule around the sharing of result and the publication of results. Some datasets have their own additional rule for the sharing and publication of results. Make sure you read the information for each dataset carefully.Authorship PolicyOur team is strongly committed to team science, and to recognising the deep technical and methodological contribution of research software engineer to research outputs. We have a strong preference, specifically during the pilot phase when all project are delivered in close collaboration, for member of the OpenSAFELY team who materially contribute to your study and/or to the iterative development of the platform and analytic pipeline to be offered authorship on outputs. This is likely to change over time a the platform expands, and a external team become more customer than collaborators.

Read our for further details.Plan SWe ask that academic output comply with Wellcomes .Acknowledgment and Data Sharing / Publication PolicyNHS England oversees the final approval for all publication ready papers, report or presentations, principally to check that the output align with the stated application purpose; NHS England ha been extremely supportive of all research and analysis to date. The usual response time for approval is 1-2 weeks.The acknowledgment and sharing/publication of result guideline are dependent on the datasets used for your project. The acknowledgement content must be used in all published papers, official report and presentation given outside of your research team/collaborators.You MUST NOT share any result that have not been released through the . This includes:- verbal sharing- allowing someone to look over your shoulder- transcribing (e.g., to paper or email)- using screen sharing software or any recording device/softwareDatasets used All DatasetsAcknowledgement contentWe are very grateful for all the support received from the [EMIS Technical Operations team] [TPP Technical Operations team] [EMIS and TPP Technical Operations teams] throughout this work, and for generous assistance from the information governance and database team at NHS England and the NHS England Transformation Directorate.If the wa also used, add:North East Commissioning Support Unit provided support on behalf of all Commissioning Support Units to aggregate the high cost drug data for use in OpenSAFELY studies.SHARING OF RESULTSThe result of ANY dataset can be shared IN CONFIDENCE and ONLY with key member of the wider research team / research collaborator (for the purpose of seeking feedback and contribution to inform the final paper or report), by a webinar or by email, but the following guideline must be adhered to:Acceptable sharing example include: the senior sponsor; analyst and senior manager in the NHS E/I/X department accountable for the specific policy activity being investigated (but NOT other departments); key member of the relevant ; established relevant expert collaborators.If sharing your results, paper, report, etc., with individual external to your immediate project team (e.g. key member of the relevant scientific advisory groups; relevant external expert collaborators) you must ensure the content being shared ha been reviewed and approved by the senior sponsor (for service evaluation and audits) and your line manager/PI (for service evaluations, audit and research); and provide your co-pilot with a copy of the content.All recipient must be reminded that the content is shared in confidence and they must not distribute it further (see publication guideline below).If you are unsure that your planned sharing is appropriate, please contact your co-pilot in the first instance; or use the OpenSAFELY-users slack channel (if you have joined); or email .PUBLICATION OF RESULTS (e.g. papers, presentations, etc.)You must seek NHS England approval for any publication or wider sharing of results, papers, presentation (e.g. submitting to a journal or a pre-print server, or uploading to any public facing website). For the avoidance of doubt, this mean that if an iteration of an analysis is approved for publication, any previous or future iteration must also be approved for publication by NHS England if you want to publish them. The step you must follow for NHS England approval are:Ensure the material you seek to publish ha been reviewed and approved by the senior sponsor (for service evaluation and audits) and your line manager/PI (for service evaluations, audit and research).Discuss your material with your copilot. Your co-pilot will carry out a brief checklist on your content. There is also an author checklist for you to complete. If you do not have a copilot, please make a request for support via the OpenSAFELY slack channel and we will allocate you a co-pilot.Once the co-pilot and author checklist are complete, please e-mail (and copy your copilot) your proposed publication document (specifying your project ID, see ), alongside confirmation that the senior sponsor and line manager (for service evaluation/audit) or line manager/PI (for research) have read and approved them. The document(s) you submit for publication approval must be roughly 90% finalised versions, but the result and conclusion must be final.All submission must include a brief lay summary of the finding and also highlight anything that could be deemed contentious (we appreciate the notion of contentious is subjective). Do not just copy your abstract - please provide a lay summary.NHS England publication review window occur on a two weekly basis.

UK Renal Registry (UKRR) dataAcknowledgement contentUse the All Datasets acknowledgement above and the following:This project includes data from the UKRR derived from patient-level information collected by the NHS a part of the care and support of kidney patients. We thank all kidney patient and kidney centre involved. The data are collated, maintained, and quality assured by the UKRR, which is part of the UK Kidney Association. The interpretation and reporting of these data are the responsibility of the author and in no way should be seen a an official policy or interpretation of the UK Kidney Association. Access to the data wa facilitated by the UKRRs Data Release Group. UKRR data are used within OpenSAFELY to address a number of critical research, audit and service delivery question related to the impact of COVID-19 on patient with kidney disease.SHARING OF RESULTSUse the All Datasets Sharing of Results guide above.PUBLICATION OF RESULTS (e.g. papers, presentations, etc.)Where the recipient ha chosen to include an UKKA employee a an author on the recipient outputs, the recipient must share draft in sufficient time for the UKKA employee to have input. The UKKA follows the Information Governance and Ethics content policyFor published papers, official report and presentation you must use the following content for the relevant section headings.Note: If a study us both EMIS and TPP, please reference them both a data processor in section below.AbstractMust add: With the approval of NHS England weMethods - Data Sharing or Data Source headingsMust add: All data were linked, stored and analysed securely using the OpenSAFELY platform, , a part of the NHS England OpenSAFELY COVID-19 service. Data include pseudonymised data such a coded diagnoses, medication and physiological parameters. No free text data are included. All code is shared openly for review and re-use under MIT open license [LINK TO GITHUB REPO OF PAPER BEING SUBMITTED]. Detailed pseudonymised patient data is potentially re-identifiable and therefore not shared.When listing data sources, suggested phrase: Primary care record managed by the GP software provider, TPP/EMIS were linked to [ONS death data, etc.] through OpenSAFELY.Software and ReproducibilityIf required use: Data management wa performed using Python [XX], with analysis carried out using [Stata 16.1/Python/R]. Code for data management and analysis, a well a codelists, are archived online [link your project github repo]. [All iteration of the pre-specified study protocol are archived with version control ].For any federated analysis use: This wa an analysis delivered using federated analysis through the OpenSAFELY platform. A federated analysis involves carrying out patient level analysis in multiple secure datasets, then later combining them: codelists and code for data management and data analysis were specified once using the OpenSAFELY tools; then transmitted securely from the OpenSAFELY job server to the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform within TPPs secure environment, and separately to the OpenSAFELY-EMIS platform within EMISs secure environment, where they were each executed separately against local patient data; summary result were then reviewed for disclosiveness, released, and combined for the final outputs. All code for the OpenSAFELY platform for data management, analysis and secure code execution is shared for review and re-use under open licence on GitHub: .Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE)Where relevant: Insert any project specific PPIE.Consider: OpenSAFELY ha involved patient and the public in various ways: we developed a public website that provides a detailed description of the platform in language suitable for a lay audience (); we have participated in two citizen jury exploring public trust in OpenSAFELY; we have co-developed an explainer video ( we have patient representation who are expert by experience on our OpenSAFELY Oversight Board; we have partnered with Understanding Patient Data to produce lay explainers on the importance of large datasets for research; we have presented at various online public engagement event to key community (e.g., Healthcare Excellence Through Technology; Faculty of Clinical Informatics annual conference; NHS Assembly; HDRUK symposium); and more. To ensure the patient voice is represented, we are working closely to decide on language choice with appropriate medical research charity (e.g., Association of Medical Research Charities). We will share information and interpretation of our finding through press releases, social medium channels, and plain language summaries.Information governance and ethical approvalMust add: NHS England is the data controller of the NHS England OpenSAFELY COVID-19 Service; [TPP is the data processor] [EMIS is the data processor] [EMIS and TPP are the data processors]; all study author using OpenSAFELY have the approval of NHS England. This implementation of OpenSAFELY is hosted within the [EMIS environment which is] [TPP environment which is] [EMIS and TPP environment which are] accredited to the ISO 27001 information security standard and [is][are] NHS IG Toolkit compliant;Patient data ha been pseudonymised for analysis and linkage using industry standard cryptographic hashing techniques; all pseudonymised datasets transmitted for linkage onto OpenSAFELY are encrypted; access to the NHS England OpenSAFELY COVID-19 service is via a virtual private network (VPN) connection; the researcher hold contract with NHS England and only access the platform to initiate database query and statistical models; all database activity is logged; only aggregate statistical output leave the platform environment following best practice for anonymisation of result such a statistical disclosure control for low cell counts.The service adheres to the obligation of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018. The service previously operated under notice initially issued in February 2020 by the the Secretary of State under Regulation 3(4) of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 (COPI Regulations), which required organisation to process confidential patient information for COVID-19 purposes; this set aside the requirement for patient consent. As of 1 July 2023, the Secretary of State ha requested that NHS England continue to operate the Service under the COVID-19 Directions 2020. In some case of data sharing, the common law duty of confidence is met using, for example, patient consent or support from the Health Research Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group.Taken together, these provide the legal base to link patient datasets using the service. GP practices, which provide access to the primary care data, are required to share relevant health information to support the public health response to the pandemic, and have been informed of how the service operates.For RESEARCH, you must add: This study wa approved by the Health Research Authority [REC reference XXX] and by the XXX Ethics Board [reference XXX].For SERVICE EVALUATION/AUDIT, you must add: This study wa supported by [NAME + OFFICIAL ROLE] a senior sponsor, and approved by the XXX Ethics Board [reference XXX]. (NHS England service evaluations/audits are currently not required to have Ethics approval.)NOTE: remember to add additional governance and ethical content pertaining to data not processed within OpenSAFELY.Data access and verificationIf requested, use the following: Access to the underlying identifiable and potentially re-identifiable pseudonymised electronic health record data is tightly governed by various legislative and regulatory frameworks, and restricted by best practice. The data in the NHS England OpenSAFELY COVID-19 service is drawn from General Practice data across England where [EMIS is the data processor][TPP is the data processor][EMIS and TPP are the data processors].[EMIS][TPP][EMIS and TPP] developer initiate an automated process to create pseudonymised record in the core OpenSAFELY database, which are copy of key structured data table in the identifiable records. These pseudonymised record are linked onto key external data resource that have also been pseudonymised via SHA-512 one-way hashing of NHS number using a shared salt. University of Oxford, Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science developer and PIs, who hold contract with NHS England, have access to the OpenSAFELY pseudonymised data table to develop the OpenSAFELY tools.These tool in turn enable researcher with OpenSAFELY data access agreement to write and execute code for data management and data analysis without direct access to the underlying raw pseudonymised patient data, and to review the output of this code. All code for the full data management pipeline from raw data to completed result for this analysis and for the OpenSAFELY platform a a whole is available for review at github.com/OpenSAFELY.The data management and analysis code for this paper wa led by (XX) and contributed to by (XX).The NHS England OpenSAFELY COVID-19 service - privacy notice.
