VISITING ADDRESS NeIC c/o NordForsk Stensberggata 27 NO-0170 Oslo POSTAL ADDRESS NeIC c/o NordForsk Stensberggata 25 NO-0170 Oslo CONTACT US NeIC 2023 WHAT IS NEIC? NeIC's activity work to improve e-infrastructure and enable better research in the Nordic-Baltic region. We facilitate this work by funding and managing development project and other activity that focus on developing solution and platform in several field of science, such a sensitive data and climate research. Funding of NeICs activity is provided through national funding agencies, NordForsk and participating project partners. NeIC is hosted by NordForsk, which provides for and facilitates Nordic cooperation on research and research infrastructure across the Nordic region. NeIC wa established in the key area of e-infrastructure in 2012, and it sustainability wa consolidated through a Memorandum of Understanding between the five national research council and NordForsk. NeIC ha two major roles. The first role is to assume operational responsibility for the Nordic distributed Tier-1 facility that is part of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) that provides computing and storage for CERN and is used by high energy physicist worldwide. The second is to jointly or collaboratively explore, evaluate, develop and deploy innovative infrastructure service in response to the strategic priority in the area of e-infrastructure and the need of the national e-infrastructure providers, their user and selected ESFRI project of joint Nordic interest. NeIC e-infrastructure project are collaboration on the building block for the future capability and NeIC is NordForsks main tool to implement the Nordic eScience Action Plan 2.0. NeIC is at an intersection point between national, Nordic and international strategies. NeIC ha worked to increase collaboration through a set of project that include the national provider (CSC, DeiC, RHnet, SNIC, Sigma2 and ETAIS), partner in ESFRI projects, and other institution in the Nordics and Europe. NeIC project are in place in the area of Physics and Engineering Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Humanities, Culture and Society, Life Science and e-Sciences. The first set of NeIC project ha generated follow-on project and new project with new partner are being formalized. This show both a regeneration capability and a new opportunity capability that are based on the NeIC collaboration infrastructure, which is strongly indicative of viable, capable organisation. As a result of NeICs activities, Nordic researcher have more open avenue for resources, advanced support, collaboration and scientific advancement. Some of the specific benefit for researcher include access to a common Nordic support center and common tool for data sharing and analysis for biodiversity researchers, sharing mechanism for high-performance computing resources, workshop for researcher to improve scientific software development, maximizing national investment in EISCAT_3D, stimulating collaboration on earth system modelling, boosting Nordic natural language processing research, offering national hardware resource to the world-wide high-energy physic community that reciprocates access for national researchers, and stimulating the development of leading-edge secure national e-infrastructure for biomedical data through Nordic collaboration. OUR VISION NeIC is a global role model for cross-border distributed and sustainable e-infrastructure collaborations. OUR HISTORY In 2002 the Joint Committee of the Nordic Natural Science Research Councils (NOS-N) supported a pilot project with the aim of establishing an inter-Nordic data grid test facility (NDGF). The purpose of the NDGF wa to distribute computing infrastructure. After a two-year pilot period, the NDGF wa given the mandate to propose a Nordic grid infrastructure and an organisation to manage and develop the grid for scientific computing in the Nordic countries. The NDGF wa hosted by NORDUnet A/S. The NDGF pilot ha since matured into the successful deployment of the first and only distributed Tier-1 service within the WLCG collaboration, and ha served a a role model for regional collaboration. STRATEGY AND FOCUS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Beneficial collaboration are the principal way that NeIC brings together the needs, interest and resource to create e-infrastructure to support research excellence in the Nordic region.

The Nordic offering is most visible a the continuous open call for Nordic use case that the project were able to advertise. The expert network is a significant outcome a it is not a given that enough trust can be built across organisation and country to be able to share expertise and discus topic of IT security implementations. Concrete outcome from the project include the following: D1: Finland, Norway and Sweden have successfully deployed and established federated EGA Nordic node along with creating the possibility of deploying the SDA solution a a standalone. 4 D2/D3: Established procedure for data and workflow mobility across the Nordic countries. The use of container technology have matured, and the establishment of common practice have made them an invaluable tool in several of the D4 use cases. New technological solution were developed including SAPEIN that in the future will make it possible to exchange information between secure clouds. D4: Within the use case program, a total of 24 use case were supported. Four of these use case were concluded successfully solving technical issue associated with a scientific aim. Additionally, two infrastructure use case were concluded a well. Seven use case did not reach conclusion, but resource have been secured for their continued development. D5: Inventory of the federated authentication landscape and specifically helped make REMS compliant with the GA4GH passport standard thereby making it feasible for use in a federated authorization framework (i.e. Elixir AAI). In summary, one can state that most of the objective of the project were achieved and that significant advance ha been made towards offering sensitive data service in Nordic scale. Further proof of the success of the project is that the project partner were willing to continue the collaboration and even agreed to increase investment in it. As a result, two follow up project ha been initiated: NeIC PaRI project ha started November 2020, directly following the Tryggve2 project. Heilsa Tryggvedottir project ha been approved and is expected to start January of 2021 Details on the project result are listed in the Johanna Trnroos win the best presentation award at Elixir AHM 2020 Johanna Trnroos is the winner of the award for the best presentation at the Impact and Innovation Mini- Symposium during the All Hands Meeting 2020. She presented Impact through Collaboration in the Nordics within The Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) from exchanging knowledge to increasing competency and research quality. She employed an example from the Tryggve2 Project, where NeIC support the development of sensitive data management tool used, among others, in assessing the risk of heritable and familial cancers.
