For this edition of our interview series with DHU synergies, we focus on the innovative effort of the SIRENE project (Social Innovation Responsive Environments NETwork) and how they are facilitating the growth of innovation ecosystem for Smart Healthy Age-Friendly Environments (SHAFE) implementation across Europe. 1) Whats SIRENEs Mission? SIRENE is a project funded by the Horizon Europe programme that started in November 2022. The project support the growth of social innovation ecosystem delivering eco-friendly and sustainable community-based service for Smart Healthy Age-Friendly Environments (SHAFE) implementation in Europe. SIRENE aim to create an impact by empowering social and private entrepreneur to improve the well-being and housing condition of the European population. The project is developing a framework for investment and the broad adoption of high-quality smart living solutions, combining the housing sector and ICT infrastructure. The Social Innovation framework of SIRENE is co-created with the Expert Hub a group of more than 50 expert from the EU-27 and beyond, representing various field such a health and social care, housing, ICT, policy and funding, and urban transformation. The project also delivers an online repository that compiles relevant resource and a community platform for knowledge exchange. 2) SIRENEs Impact: how is it contributing to the digital transformation of health and care? SIRENE contributes to the digital transformation of health and care by leveraging technology to create smarter, healthier, and more inclusive environment across Europe. SIRENE seek to empower ecosystem that nourish new strategy for investment in housing for independent living and ageing well in place, promoting green behaviour and sustainable practices. SIRENEs framework aim to offer a quality benchmark that is relevant to those investing in social innovation for the physical design of products, home and the IT infrastructure within it. It will respond, therefore, to the changing need of an ageing population and the associated imperative that call for people to play a greater part in maintaining their wellbeing and managing their health. A responsive, inclusive, eco-friendly home should, in other words, not just be concerned with access, mobility and usability; it must also be concerned with the person ability, where appropriate, to stay engaged in work and social activity, network on-line and to access information and services. This is a key aspect of the digital transformation of health and care empower people and provide them the tool to self-management and pursuit of a more active and healthy living. 3) Ecosystem enablers: what are SIRENEs effort to facilitate the uptakeof digital solutions? SIRENEs ambition is to facilitate an EU-wide network of network connecting different actor and perspective under a common theme, to promote the implementation of SHAFE innovations. To pursuit this aim, SIRENE created and is promoting a co-creation network of expert and local ecosystem that enables the identification of need and that will test and validate the project outputs, thus increasing the potential of broad adoption and it sustainability. We are fully convinced that the uptake of digital solution and the overall increase in health and wellbeing depends on systemic collaboration. This is why SIRENE connects stakeholder by having them working together towards a Social Innovation framework and supporting tools, claiming that this joint collaborative and co-creative work is the keystone for true societal development. For the SIRENE project it wa important to find out which ecosystem model best fit it goals. For this purpose a new helix model wa created: the Transnational Local-sphere Model. This model put more focus on stakeholders, organisations, and underrepresented entities; it is user-centred by using a bottom-up approach; it includes (trans)national collaboration and competition, integrates both global and local ecosystems, and involves civic society, through the medium and the public. By using the Transnational Local-sphere model, SIRENE is connecting existing local ecosystem and creating a network of stakeholder in all sector to ensure an accessible and sustainable implementation of SHAFE solution across Europe. 4) Promoting collaboration: what are SIRENEs main synergy and outcomes? During it first year, SIRENE established synergy with different initiatives, such a the COST Action NET4Age-Friendly, the SHAFE Foundation, project UrbanAge, AFC Toolkit and INTEGER, a well a DHU, of course. These collaboration already provided some material results, namely joint event and publications, such a the Training Schools developed with NET4Age-Friendly in Tirana and Skopje, a joint webinar with UrbanAge and a joint publication with INTEGER. From these collaboration several positive outcome always result, namely the exchange of knowledge and new perspective for both sides, the enlargement of our target audience and the creation of new idea and potential partnerships.This is just the start,as we have more event to follow: thematic workshop spanning from innovation ecosystemcreation to digitization,and impact assessmentsocial innovationframeworks that we will make available to theSIcommunity. Information and registration will be available on ourand social media. Being SIRENE a Coordination and Support Action, enlarging the network and collaborating with other initiative is always an added value, a this is central to increasing awareness and captivating more active voice to promote a more inclusive and healthier living in Europe.Andthere are several way to join us. It can be done through Science Cafes and workshop organized with our partner or by joining the, acommunity space for networking and knowledge exchange open to expert in social innovation ecosystem delivering eco-friendly and sustainable community-based service for Smart Healthy Age-Friendly Environments.
