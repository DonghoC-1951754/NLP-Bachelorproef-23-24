For patients














Critical knowledge gaps in prostate cancer
Critical knowledge gaps in relation to the screening, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer patients make clinical practice decision-making difficult and inconsistent; this means that predicting which patients will have the best outcomes with specific treatments is currently suboptimal. These gaps are dispersed throughout the patients journey (from diagnosis to treatment) and they compromise the quality of care provided to patients, as well as affecting their quality of life.
At the start of PIONEER, the EAU Prostate Cancer Guideline panel and other Key Opinion Leaders were contacted to identify the most important knowledge gaps. Afterwards, the PIONEER consortium performed a prioritisation survey among two stakeholder groups: healthcare professionals including pharmaceutical companies and prostate cancer patients to identify and prioritise a list of the top five research questions in prostate cancer.
In total, 73 healthcare professionals and 57 patients participated in round one of the surveys. Twelve questions were proposed during the first round. For the second round the patients surveys were also translated into French, German, Italian and Spanish. Forty nine healthcare professionals and 169 patients (including 53 English; 19 French; 31 German; 53 Italian; 13 Spanish) participated in round two of the surveys. The results were analysed by calculating the percentage of respondents scoring each question as not important, important or critically important. These 56 questions were then re-ordered according to the highest percentage for critically important, enabling identification of the top 5 questions from the two each stakeholder groups.

PIONEERs top five research questions are:

What are the relevant tumour-specific and patient-specific variables that affect prognosis of PCa patients suitable for active surveillance?
What is the natural history of PCa patients undergoing conservative management (i.e., watchful waiting) and what is the impact of comorbidities and life expectancy on long-term outcomes?
Currently, the scientific community generally applies the EAU Guidelines PCa risk stratification, stratifying patients into low-, intermediate- and high-risk PCa. This is based on the risk of recurrent disease of patients after radical treatments. However, this risk stratification still has its limits and patients still have very heterogeneous outcomes especially in the high-risk group. What we still do not know is what differentiates patients with lethal vs non-lethal disease, irrespective of their risk stratification.
When should we treat patients, who experience prostate cancer recurrence after primary treatment, and which are the most effective therapeutic approaches?
Which specific patient groups benefit most of upfront chemotherapy? What are the side effects and What is impact on quality of life in real-life practice of chemotherapy in this setting?

For more information on how these questions will be addressed in PIONEER read our  overview.

Patient testimonials
Patient representatives, Erik Briers and Ken Mastris, reflect on the relevance of PIONEER for prostate cancer patients.






Erik Briers, prostate cancer patient, Belgium
The PIONEER project and its application of real-world data to answer unknown questions relating to prostate cancer is very important for patients. Clinical trials are done with highly selected patients, thus many subpopulations (e.g. patients with kidney problems) are excluded. Once new medicines received market authorisation all patients can be treated with them, but really we have no data on their benefit to patients in the untested subpopulations. Big Data and real-world data can deliver the answer to this question: Do patients in subgroups benefit?. The answer to this question has the potential to protect patients from unwanted side effects from medicines that may in fact have no benefit to them. It also enables saving across healthcare systems; ultimately, making our healthcare systems more sustainable. This is just one example of many, so yes, PIONEER and the BD4BO programme is of high importance to patients.


 




Ken Mastris, prostate cancer patient, United Kingdom
Its time for more research on prostate cancer. Overall it effects nearly as many people as breast cancer, but up to now has received comparatively minimum research funding, and progress made in this field has been limited when compared to other major cancer types. Insufficient knowledge of patient characteristics and risk factors at time of diagnosis means that deciding which patients will have the best outcome with specific treatments is challenging at best. Big Data if properly combined and analysed can bridge this knowledge gap. Therefore, the goals of the BD4BO programme and PIONEER will help future patients. I hope it brings early stratification of patients at diagnosis so patients can make the right choice of treatment for them guided by their urologist. Fixing the gaps in the patient journey will benefitall.

Core Outcome Sets
















    

 





PIONEER Prostate Cancer Core Outcome Sets
The PIONEER Core Outcome Sets (COSs) for Localised, Locally Advanced, Metastatic, and Non-metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer are the result of a methodological rigorous systematic review and consensus finding process with a diverse range of prostate cancer stakeholders including clinicians, nurses, researchers, industry partners and most importantly patients.
The PIONEER Prostate Cancer COSs have also been endorsed by the European Association of Urology, Europes leading medical authority on urological practice, research, and education. A reflection on the importance of COS for the advancement of clinical practice.
The PIONEER Prostate Cancer COSs are a continually evolving resource. They represent a minimum set of outcomes, which can be amended with defendable justification, depending on clinical setting and changes in the treatment landscape. Therefore, we would highly encourage everybody to start measuring these outcomes to improve treatment and care for prostate cancer patients.

Patient Reported Outcome Measures
Prostate cancer is characterised by a relatively long natural history, and a substantial proportion of patients die from causes other than the disease itself. Therefore, assessment and monitoring of treatment-related side effects and of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) play a major role in the management of PCa patients.
There is increasing awareness of the importance of measuring what were previously regarded as softer outcomes, namely, side effects and HRQoL, using patient reported outcome measures (PROMs). This is crucial when considering that cancer patients may have the possibility of trading HRQoL for length of life.
PIONEER has systematically reviewed both clinician reported outcomes andthepsychometric properties ofused in localised, locally advanced, and metastatic prostate cancer. Based on the results of the reviews and subsequent consensus processes, PIONEER recommended minimum sets of clinician and patient reported outcomes, provided definitions or each, and recommended PROMs, for use in routine practice and research settings

PIONEER Diagnostic & Prognostic Factor Online Search Tool

 














 







Background & Development Process
Multiple biomarkers are available to improve prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, knowledge on which diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers can be used to select patients for a specific treatment remains unclear. Developed by a multidisciplinary team using a four step approach the PIONEER online search tool for prostate cancer diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers aims to bridge this knowledge gap. For information on the methodology behind the PIONEER search tool read the projects .



 









 





What motivates PIONEER researchers

 



"It was a truly cross-functional project where we brought together expertise from very different areas. In my case it is expertise about natural language processing and annotation of digital documents. In Dans case it was the programming skills, and other colleagues brought in the medical knowledge etc. Thus, we brought together experts from different fields to have all those components that were necessary to make this work."Dr. Wolfgang ThielemannHead of Semantic & Knowledge Graph Technologies Bayer AG"Our knowledge on how to approach and treat prostate cancer changes daily. With the purpose of providing our patients with the best possible information we need tools to keep us up to date. Our DPF tool will provide easy access to validated patient and disease specific factors which can be implemented for each patient individually to provide better patient-centered care."Dr. Lisa MorrisUrology Resident & EAU Guidelines Office Senior Associate"As one of the researchers, I was very much aware of all the work that was put into this  including the background work from the core outcomes set developed in WP2. For me it was very motivating to turn all this work into an online platform where it can be showcased and used. Dan and Wolfgang did agreat job in translating our groundwork into this platform and the platform development was really efficient."Dr. Megan MolnarEpidemiologist Bayer AG"DPFs that are capable of significantly improving diagnosis and prognosis in prostate cancer are an unmet need as most of them require additional evaluation in properly designed studies. Developing a tool that helps researchers to understand the quality of the current available studies, motivated me a lot."Dr. Mieke Van HemelrijckProf. of Cancer Epidemiology Head of TOUR King's College London"Diagnosis and prognosis play a vital role in patient management and decision making. The assessment of DPFs is one of the major objectives in clinical research and I was excited to take part in such an important project."Dr. Michael LardasUrologist Greece & EAU Guidelines Senior Assoicate"It stood out how quickly we went from first discussions to the first working prototype and further to the final product. We were able to accomplish this due to the close collaboration with everyone involved as well ast he lean setups and tool chains which we developed within DTLab.

Posted on October 31, 2023 in 





PIONEER  Big Data in Prostate Cancer project continues as PIONEER+ and will be integrated into the EAU`s UroEvidenceHub initiative as the hub for prostate cancer research and support.
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 31st October 2023  The European funded prostate cancer (PCa) project PIONEER will continue to perform data analytics, real world evidence generation and other research activities as PIONEER+ also after the official project end on 31 October 2023. PIONEER+ becomes the foundational partner for Prostate Cancer research and support of the emerging UroEvidenceHub initiative by the European Association of Urology. Their common vision is to dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment of PCa and other Urological Conditions to drastically reduce the burden of Urological Conditions in the population. This shall be done through the use of big data analytics, data driven Clinical Guidelines and Decision Support Tools.
 (Prostate Cancer DIagnOsis and TreatmeNt Enhancement through the Power of Big Data in EuRope) is an European Network of Excellence for Big Data in Prostate Cancer, consisting of 34 private and public stakeholders in prostate cancer research and clinical care from across 10 countries. Through unlocking the potential of Big Data, PIONEER addresses important patient and physician questions regarding the diagnosis, treatment and management of Prostate Cancer. By generating Real World Evidence, the interdisciplinary project team aims to change the prostate cancer landscape and to improve the health and social care received by all prostate cancer patients and their families.
 (UHE) is a new data innovation programme of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and a Real-World Evidence (RWE) generation ecosystem that will use big data, artificial intelligence and data science to accelerate research on personalized care for patients across all urological conditions stating with Prostate Cancer.
The ultimate goal of the 2023 founded UroEvidenceHub is to close the gap between clinical practice guidelines and individual patient characteristics and disease variability. By bringing the data (secondary as well as prospectively collected PROMS, PREMS, and QoL) and analytics together, we seek to enable more personalized patient care across all urological conditions.., says Prof. James NDow, Adjunct Secretary General of the European Association of Urology and Project Coordinator of PIONEER. 
In over 5 years of working together in a multidisciplinary team of leading professionals in their fields of expertise, PIONEER has created a legacy with the PIONEER Big Data Platform. PIONEER+ forms the ideal partner of the UroEvidenceHub as it will continue to address the urgent questions in prostate cancer care and supports patient outcomes and decision making within the UroEvidenceHub. PIONEER+ and UHE will thus maximise synergies to augment the benefit for the patients and their families.
Legacy of PIONEER  Big Data in Prostate Cancer
Since its start on 1st May 2018, PIONEER has been a unique collaboration between the consortia members which include Physicians, Academic Researchers, industry partners, public companies and patients. The high degree of motivation and engagement as well as the close involvement of patients played a central role from the beginning. These are the projects key achievements:

Together with patients, key opinion leaders and health care professionals, fifty-six prioritized research questions important to all stakeholders were identified, out of which the top five questions about the diagnosis and management of Prostate Cancer were prioritized. To address and answer these, the team set out to develop a unique central and federated state-of-the-art Big Data analytic platform for prostate cancer. So far, the PIONEER team has identified over 100 relevant databases, mapped to the OMOP-CDM and made available for research over 40 data sets as part of the . The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) is an open community data standard, designed to standardize the structure and content of observational data and to enable efficient analyses that can produce reliable evidence.
The PIONEER consortium has successfully conducted three international large-scale study-a-thons and has established over a dozen different research teams looking at specific research questions.
PIONEER managed to develop a common vocabulary and understanding of methods and techniques making it possible to efficiently execute on research projects bringing together scientists with backgrounds in observational research, as well as others coming more from the clinical research and/or clinical practice arena. The output of this includes over a dozen manuscripts, and numerous conference presentations. With the help of intensive patient participation, PIONEER has published  that were endorsed by the European Association of Urology. PIONEER has systematically reviewed both clinician reported outcomes andthepsychometric properties ofused in localised, locally advanced, and metastatic prostate cancer. Based on the results of the reviews and subsequent consensus processes, PIONEER recommended minimum sets of clinician and patient reported outcomes, provided definitions or each, and recommended PROMs, for use in routine practice and research settings. Furthermore, PIONEER has developed and launched an .

Combining the ongoing activities at PIONEER with the emerging data innovations vision at the EAU provides the best opportunity for PIONEER to continue to have an impact on not only Prostate Cancer but leverage its experiences to impact many other diseases across urology and beyond to other non-urological diseases.
Stakeholders are invited to collaborate with PIONEER+ and UHE
Welcome to all interested clinicians, researchers, data scientists, and patients!
Become part of the community and work togeher on many of the challenges we are facing. If we want to use big data to answer core research questions, we need everyone. PIONEER+ offers working with a broader and well-rehearsed research scientific community that takes good care of cooperation with partners.
It`s not the end it`s just the beginning of an exciting and meaningful journey.
