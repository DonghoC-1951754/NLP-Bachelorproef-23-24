WHAT IS NEIC?

          NeIC's activities work to improve e-infrastructure and enable better research in the Nordic-Baltic region. We facilitate this work by funding and managing development projects and other activities that focus on developing solutions and platforms in several fields of science, such as sensitive data and climate research. Funding of NeICs activities is provided through national funding agencies, NordForsk and participating project partners.
         NeIC is hosted by NordForsk, which provides for and facilitates Nordic cooperation on research and research infrastructure 
          across the Nordic region. NeIC was established in the key area of e-infrastructure in 2012, and its sustainability was
          consolidated through a Memorandum of Understanding between the five national research councils and NordForsk. NeIC has two 
          major roles. The first role is to assume operational responsibility for the Nordic distributed Tier-1 facility that is part 
          of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) that provides computing and storage for CERN and is used by high energy physicists
          worldwide. The second is to jointly or collaboratively explore, evaluate, develop and deploy innovative infrastructure 
          services in response to the strategic priorities in the area of e-infrastructure and the needs of the national 
          e-infrastructure providers, their users and selected ESFRI projects of joint Nordic interest.  NeIC e-infrastructure projects
          are collaborations on the building blocks for the future capabilities and NeIC is NordForsks main tool to implement the 
          Nordic eScience Action Plan 2.0. 
          
          NeIC is at an intersection point between national, Nordic and international strategies. NeIC has worked to increase 
          collaborations through a set of projects that include the national providers (CSC, DeiC, RHnet, SNIC, Sigma2 and ETAIS),
          partners in ESFRI projects, and other institutions in the Nordics and Europe. NeIC projects are in place in the areas of 
          Physics and Engineering Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Humanities, Culture and Society, Life Science and e-Sciences.  
          The first set of NeIC projects has generated follow-on projects and new projects with new partners are being formalized.
          This shows both a regeneration capability and a new opportunities capability that are based on the NeIC collaboration
          infrastructure, which is strongly indicative of viable, capable organisation. 
          
          As a result of NeICs activities, Nordic researchers have more open avenues for resources, advanced support, collaborations 
          and scientific advancement.  Some of the specific benefits for researchers include access to a common Nordic support center 
          and common tools for data sharing and analysis for biodiversity researchers, sharing mechanisms for high-performance computing
          resources, workshops for researchers to improve scientific software development, maximizing national investments in EISCAT_3D,
          stimulating collaboration on earth system modelling, boosting Nordic natural language processing research, offering national 
          hardware resources to the world-wide high-energy physics community that reciprocates access for national researchers, and 
          stimulating the development of leading-edge secure national e-infrastructure for biomedical data through Nordic collaboration.
       
        







OUR VISION
NeIC is a global role model for cross-border distributed and sustainable e-infrastructure collaborations.













OUR HISTORY


            In 2002 the Joint Committee of the Nordic Natural Science Research
            Councils (NOS-N) supported a pilot project with the aim of establishing an
            inter-Nordic data grid test facility (NDGF). The purpose of the NDGF was to
            distribute computing infrastructure. After a two-year pilot period, the NDGF
            was given the mandate to propose a Nordic grid infrastructure and an
            organisation to manage and develop the grid for scientific computing in the
            Nordic countries. The NDGF was hosted by NORDUnet A/S.
          

            The NDGF pilot has since matured into the successful deployment of the
            first and only distributed Tier-1 service within the WLCG collaboration, and
            has served as a role model for regional collaboration.
          









STRATEGY AND FOCUS





STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
Beneficial collaborations are the principal way that NeIC brings together the needs, interests and resources to create e-infrastructure to support research excellence in the Nordic region.
Nordic Influence is the effect that NeIC has in improving and advancing e-infrastructure for researchers and for society.
Motivated People are essential in the collaborations and to bring the results into the research domains and society.
Effective processes bind NeIC into an organization that is able to realize the benefits and influences that come from the collaborations.








ORGANISATION

        NeIC is a joint initiative between the Nordic countries, hosted by
        NordForsk since 1. January 2012. NordForsk appoints the NeIC Board based on
        nominations by the national e-infrastructure provider organisations. These
        strategic partner organisation are CSC (Finland), SNIC (Sweden), Sigma2
        (Norway), DeiC (Denmark), RH Net (Iceland) and ETAIS (Estonia). The NeIC Board consists of one
        representative from each of these.
      

        The NordForsk Board has delegated to the NeIC Board the authority to make strategic
        decisions regarding computing and data-storage infrastructure and react on upcoming
        opportunities. This includes allocating budget, implementing the organisation structure
        as well as prioritising and coordinating Nordic collaboration projects. The NeIC Board
        develops and maintains a strategy for NeIC. The NeIC Board recommends the NeIC Director
        to be appointed by NordForsk.
      

        NeIC is managed by an Executive Team chaired by the NeIC Director.
        Most of NeICs activities are organized in projects. The Executive Team
        coordinates the activities and participate in project steering groups as
        project owners.
      

        In collaboration with national eInfrastructure providers and
        user-community representatives, NeIC engages IT experts to participate in
        projects and operational activities. Projects are developed in accordance with
        the directions set out in the Nordic eScience Action Plan 2.0 (2015).

      












OUR VALUES
Open, reliable and continuously striving to improve in our work, we are motivated by adding value to research.

Application Programming Interface
Our website in general tries to make information on NeIC available in a format
that is comfortable for humans to read.
Our API makes the same information available in a format that is comfortable for
computers to read.
Having an API makes it easier for developers to make services on top of our
information, to provide up-to-date views and reports on NeIC activities. For
example, NeIC uses this API internally in our activities to track fluctuations
in staffing over time, to ensure it all adds up in the end.

Tryggve Use Cases
Tryggve team wants to support researchers in taking the secure data services into use, and thereby to achieve results faster and safer. In practice, Tryggve implements specific Use Cases as part of the project. The Use Cases drive the development in Tryggve towards actual and concrete demands of the users. Use Cases aim to solve real-life issues in data management and/or to provide state-of-the-art research environment for sensitive research data.
The easiest way to start using secure services from Tryggve is to apply for a Tryggve use case. To submit the proposal, the project should have a research plan (involving sensitive data) and already established collaboration in the Nordics. Consult the list below on examples of what kind of support Tryggve can provide for use cases.
Feel free to  on any questions concerning accessing of the Nordic systems
for sensitive data, for example if you are unsure whether to submit a use case or access separate systems directly.

Collaboration for Sensitive Data



On this page you can find the latest news of the Tryggve project and past events
Tryggve project outcomes and Final report
The main results of the project can be summarised to be establishing a Nordic offering of services for sensitive
data in biomedical research, and establishing a Nordic network of experts capable of jointly developing secure
IT services.
The Nordic offering is most visible as the continuous open call for Nordic use cases that the project were able
to advertise. The expert network is a significant outcome as it is not a given that enough trust can be built
across organisations and countries to be able to share expertise and discuss topics of IT security
implementations. Concrete outcomes from the project include the following:

D1: Finland, Norway and Sweden have successfully deployed and established federated EGA Nordic
nodes along with creating the possibilities of deploying the SDA solution as a standalone.

4

D2/D3: Established procedures for data and workflow mobility across the Nordic countries. The use of
container technologies have matured, and the establishment of common practices have made them
an invaluable tool in several of the D4 use cases. New technological solutions were developed
including SAPEIN that in the future will make it possible to exchange information between secure
clouds.
D4: Within the use case program, a total of 24 use cases were supported. Four of these use cases
were concluded successfully solving technical issues associated with a scientific aim. Additionally, two
infrastructure use cases were concluded as well. Seven use cases did not reach conclusion, but
resources have been secured for their continued development.
D5: Inventory of the federated authentication landscape and specifically helped make REMS compliant
with the GA4GH passport standard thereby making it feasible for use in a federated authorization
framework (i.e. Elixir AAI).
In summary, one can state that most of the objectives of the project were achieved and that significant advance
has been made towards offering sensitive data services in Nordic scale. Further proof of the success of the
project is that the project partners were willing to continue the collaboration and even agreed to increase
investment in it. As a result, two follow up projects has been initiated:
NeIC PaRI project has started November 2020, directly following the Tryggve2 project.
Heilsa Tryggvedottir project has been approved and is expected to start January of 2021
Details on the project results are listed in the

Johanna Trnroos is the winner of the award for the best presentation at the Impact and Innovation Mini-
Symposium during the All Hands Meeting 2020. She presented Impact through Collaboration in the Nordics
within The Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)  from exchanging knowledge to increasing
competencies and research quality. She employed an example from the Tryggve2 Project, where NeIC
supports the development of sensitive data management tools used, among others, in assessing the risk of
heritable and familial cancers.

Ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) are topics that require close attention when dealing with human data. The Tryggve ELSI activity aims to assess and document requirements associated with cross-border sharing, moving, storing and/or processing of human data for research purposes.
The project has created a checklist of items that are required for conducting cross-border human data research. It is meant to be a tool to help such projects to be aware of the requirements and identify gaps in these areas for the particular research cross-border collaborations. The checklist is available as:

Data Protection Impact Assessment
According to , when a type of personal processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data, a so called Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Large-scale processing of sensitive data such as genetic or other health related data is listed by all Data Protection Authorities as requiring DPIAs.
The French Data Protection Authority has made a DPIA tool (endorsed by several other DPAs) available that can help in performing these impact assessments. See the  page for more information.
