The EBMT Registry





The EBMT Registry, established in 1974, is the backbone of the EBMTs research and educational activities. It provides a pool of data to haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) healthcare professionals to perform studies, assess epidemiological trends, and ultimately improve the care of patients with haematological malignancies and other life-threatening disorders.
As of 2023, the EBMT Registry has acquired data on over 700,000 patients that received an HCT procedure as well as data on over 4,000 patients that received CAR T-cell therapy. All thanks to the reporting done by our members, who in order to retain full EBMT membership status, they must report all consecutive HCTs each year.
The EBMT Registry contains patient clinical data, including aspects of the diagnosis and disease, first-line treatments, HCT or cell-therapy-associated procedures, transplant type, donor type, stem cell source, complications and outcome. Patients are followed up indefinitely. Basic donor information is included with these procedures, and donor follow-up data can be entered by the transplant centre (or Donor Registry, for unrelated donors).
All EBMT Registry studies are performed under the supervision of the EBMT Working Parties.

Working Parties





The 11 Working Parties are bodies whose mission is to implement the EBMT's Scientific and Educational policies. Together with the Data Offices, they develop and manage scientific proposals, and they also contribute to the definition of guidelines and policies. With the support of the Executive Office, the Working Parties are the key drivers and developers of the educational activities offered by the EBMT. The majority of the Parties are disease-based, but there are also several transversal groups who cover multiple diseases. Learn more about each of the Working Parties by clicking the links below.

In the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the EBMT has set up this section to provide you with an array of useful information and resources.









EBMT Recommendations
Due to fast spreading of SARS-CoV-2 a panel of experts of EBMT recommends the following guidelines for transplant units, recipients, and donors of hematopoietic cells. These guidelines will be updated when new information is obtained about COVID-19 epidemiology and clinical outcome.

EBMT COVID-19 Task Force
The EBMT COVID-19 Task Force was created to support patients and the EBMT Community throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
Their goal is to tackle the different aspects of the pandemic: infectious issues, other non-infectious complications, donor and organisational issues, organisation of outpatient clinics and wards including medical and nursing activities, quality (JACIE) and educational activities.
The structure of the Task Force consists of transversal participation across the different EBMT Groups and Committees. Two coordinators and the IDWP chair will be leading the group, along with representatives from the:
Executive Committee representative
IDWP and TCWP Working Parties Chairs since the complications of SARS-CoV-2 implicate these two WPs directly
All additional WP Chairs from the ALWP, CTIWP, LWP, CMWP, ADWP, IEWP, SAAWP and PDWP

FAQ COVID-19 and implications for accreditation processes



Our inspection was scheduled and then cancelled when COVID-19 interrupted normal services. When will our inspection be rescheduled?


We will not be scheduling on-site inspections until it is safe to return to on-site visits. JACIE continues to monitor the situation and we have recently started to reach out to inspectors and our network of national representatives to assess conditions in those countries where centres are preparing for accreditation. We are working on the basis of being able to resume at least some activity in the autumn and to give ourselves and our users a horizon on which to fix. Needless to say, the safety of our volunteer inspectors is our priority and their willingness to travel and availability will be key to being able to form teams and agree dates with the centres. For that reason, we kindly ask centres for flexibility and patience in this complex task of reactivation and to support the inspectors with all necessary safety measures.
In the case of those cancelled inspections, JACIE will make every effort to assign the same inspection team as inspectors will have already made preparations for the on-site visit.




We are in the pre-inspection phase of the accreditation process. What should we do?


Centres should continue to submit documents and maintain correspondence with their assigned Accreditation Coordinator. Accreditation Coordinators are available by email or teleconference (on request) to assist you. JACIE understands that the situation will affect centres preparations and can offer flexibility with regard to timelines so please notify your Coordinator when you anticipate delays.
Note that where processes take longer than expected, centres may be asked to update information provided earlier and to provide any updated versions of documentation in order for inspectors to have the most recent information and related files.




What happens if our accreditation expires?


Centres whose accreditation expired after 31 March 2020 automatically received a 12-month extension of this accreditation cycle and were notified in early April by email.
Accreditations that had already expired before 1 April 2020 were not extended. Those centres that have submitted an application for accreditation are listed as "In Process" in a separate list from the Accredited centres. This is referred to as "coverage", a term limited to acknowledging that a given centre is in the accreditation process without having yet achieved accreditation. A letter to this effect can be requested by the centre by writing to .
The JACIE website is the official source of the lists of Accredited Centres and Centres in Process. See www.ebmt.org/jacie-accredited-centres for details. In some cases, a centre may appear in both lists because their most recent accreditation is still in force AND they have submitted an application to renew their accreditation e.g. accreditation expiring in December 2020 and application for reaccreditation submitted in December 2019. It is up to the centre if they wish to proceed with their new application. In any case, JACIE encourages early applications for reaccreditation (at least 12 months before expiry and earlier if possible) to avoid or minimise gaps between accreditations.
Centres with expired accreditation awards are not listed. A letter confirmed previous accreditation awards can be provided upon request.




Due to the pandemic, we have had to make temporary changes to our set-up and processes. What do we need to report to JACIE?


JACIE is aware that centres may have to move patients or change services temporarily due to the current extraordinary circumstances. These changes do not require immediate reporting nor JACIE approval. Nonetheless, such changes occurring in centres currently accredited should be reported to JACIE as soon as possible using the Changes affecting Accreditation Report document found at https://www.ebmt.org/ebmt/documents/changes-affecting-accreditation-report. These reports will be provided to inspectors at the next inspection.
Centres should apply quality management principles to these changes including a risk assessment with appropriate mitigation of any identified risks to the extent possible. By definition, these changes represent deviations from normal procedures and practice and so should follow internal processes for planning and approving or for reporting and documenting when unplanned. Standards B/C/D4.12 and B/CM/C/D5.7 apply.
Regarding changes to patient care, centres are directed to the EBMT COVID-19 resources page where guidance and recommendations by EBMT and other organisations are collated. See 




I am already accredited. When should I receive my certificate ?


Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, activities in the JACIE office have been affected. It is not currently possible to print the certificates on our official stamped paper. This is expected to be resolved in the coming weeks when staff can return to the office. A PDF accreditation letter will be provided by email in the meantime. Please contact your Accreditation Coordinator with all requests.




My centre has been already inspected and we are waiting for the inspection report. How can we demonstrate we applied for re-accreditation? 


The COVID-19 has impacted the activity of our inspectors and the Office, which may lead to delays in the inspection reports. Centres can ask for a letter from JACIE stating that the centre is in process of being JACIE accredited.
For any queries please contact: 




My centre has to go through the Interim Audit (IA) this year. Are interim audits being postponed?


If your centre is due to send the IA documents in 2020, the process will remain as scheduled. As the audit is only document-based, centres can still present documentation focused on quality management aspects. The JACIE office will send them to the inspectors for review.
Be kindly reminded that your interim audit is due in the same month you obtained the accreditation.If your centre requires some extra time to gather the documents please contact , We can extend the deadline for a month if required.
The required documents can be found :

Equality, Diversity & Inclusion (ED&I)





EBMT takes its approach to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion seriously. We believe that improving good practice in these areas is key to unlocking the potential contributions to our work of all our Members and staff and, most important, critical to our wider work challenging health inequalities in patient care.
In 2021 EBMT developed a three-year action plan to deliver progress in this area. An internal Taskforce was set up to help implement this. In June 2021, the EBMT Board approved the creation of the EBMT ED&I Committee. EDI outcomes are now reported annually to the EBMT Board.
At EBMT we believe that better delivery over time of EDI issues is critical to providing the very best service to our worldwide patient community..

Foreword by the EBMT President Anna Sureda reflects on the EBMT's achievements and milestones of the past year. This comprehensive report encapsulates our journey towards excellence in Science, Education and Patient Care. 

The year 2023 marked a significant milestone for the EBMT as a scientific Society. In August 2023, EBMT proudly unveiled the official launch of the new EBMT Registry platform, a remarkable accomplishment resulting from years of dedicated teamwork (co-funded by the European Union under the EuroTraCTOR grant). This innovative platform replaced ProMISe and Castor, thereby enhancing our data management practices for a more cohesive user experience. The primary objective of the EBMT Registry remains clear: to provide EBMT members with a pool of data to perform studies, assess epidemiological trends, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes. Close collaboration between EBMT and national registries will ensure alignment with the needs and requests of users. Presently, the EBMT Registry contains data on over 700,000 patients who underwent a hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) procedure and over 8,000 patients treated with CAR T-cells. EBMT's commitment to advancing gene therapy strategies and recognising the growing importance of haemoglobinopathies has led to the establishment of a new EBMT Working Party, the Haemoglobinopathies Working Party, which serves as the scientific and educational umbrella for all stakeholders interested in these diseases.
The activities of the GoCART Coalition in 2023 were exceptional, with a notable increase in scientific endeavours evidenced by the publication of two new manuscripts, the culmination of the third edition of scientific excellence projects, participation in numerous educational activities, and active engagement in the harmonised collection of clinical data on patients treated with gene and cellular therapies from cells and tissues of hematopoietic origin to support collaborative studies and regulatory decision-making processes.
The 2023 edition of the Annual Meeting held special significance after three consecutive years of virtual gatherings; we welcomed over 4,500 attendees in person, complemented by more than 1,200 virtual participants representing over 100 countries. The newly formed EBMT Educational Task Force, established in 2023 and led by the Chair and Co-Chair of the Scientific Council, the Scientific Council Educational Representative, and the EBMT Medical Officer, ensures the involvement of representatives from all Working Parties, the Nurses Group, the EBMT Trainee Committee, and JACIE to develop a diverse range of educational content in HCT and cellular therapy, as well as to provide resources for professional development.
Throughout 2023, the majority of mid-sized and small educational events transitioned back to in-person formats, with attendance figures closely mirroring pre-pandemic levels. Credit is due to the highly organised and proactive Trainee Committee, which played an active role in these events. Special mention must be made of the EBMT- EHA 5th European CAR T-cell Meeting held in Rotterdam in February 2023, which achieved resounding success, establishing our organisations as leaders in hosting the most significant and widely attended conference in Europe within this field. Furthermore, EBMT and the ASTCT solidified their strategic collaboration in education by hosting the 2nd Joint ASTCT-EBMT Basic and Translational Scientific Meeting in Sitges, Spain, in February 2023, and the ASTCT-EBMT 6th International Conference on Relapse After Transplant and Cellular Therapy (HSCT) in Los Angeles in November 2023. Each event provided an excellent platform for young researchers and trainees to present their work and engage with leaders in the field.
The year 2023 also marked a turning point for accreditation and benchmarking efforts. JACIE received 97 applications, representing approximately a 30% increase compared to 2022. The number of inspections conducted rose to 77, the second-highest in JACIE's history (2019: 78 inspections), signalling a return to pre-pandemic levels of activity. Moreover, the number of accredited centres reached 68 in the past year, compared to 15 in 2022 and 27 in 2021. JACIE's robust activities in 2023 included organising three training courses for inspectors, training 55 new inspectors, hosting a year-round webinar series, launching a new JACIE Inspector Handbook at the 2023 Annual Meeting, and enhancing inspector incentives by offering 72 grants for JACIE inspectors to attend the 50th Annual Meeting of the EBMT. Additionally, in collaboration with the Quality Manager Committee, JACIE developed a new, online, easily accessible accreditation preparation course aimed at boosting the confidence of centre staff in preparing for and undergoing JACIE inspections. The benchmarking project progressed steadily, thanks to the persistent dedication of various stakeholders, with the release of EBMT Benchmarking reports covering the period from 2017 to 2021 in November 2023.
The tireless efforts of the EBMT Nurses Group were evident in a variety of activities. These included the release of the 2nd edition of the EBMT Textbook for Nurses, the 15th Educational Meeting of the EBMT Nurses Group, which brought together 47 faculty members as well as patients, nurses, physicians, physiotherapists, and engineers from academic and clinical settings spanning 13 different countries. Furthermore, 2023 saw the establishment of the Nurses Next Generation Group, aimed at fostering a community for early-career Transplant and Cell Therapy nurses, and the launch of a new EBMT podcast for Nurses titled "Blood Matters".
I extend my profound gratitude to all stakeholders: the EBMT Board, the chairs of the Working Parties and Committees, the EBMT centre members and individual members, the EBMT staff, and our partners, whose generosity and selflessness facilitated our remarkable progress in 2023. Without your unwavering support, none of these achievements would have been possible. I eagerly anticipate sharing many more milestones and celebrating EBMTs 50th anniversary with our exceptional community in 2024!
Until we meet again!

Registry Release Updates





The EBMT Registry is a web application where data entry can take place. The web application was released for all users on August 24th, 2023. The release version is referred to as version 1.0.



Important information
Since the latest release of the EBMT Registry (April 24th, version 2.2), a new pop-up can be seen when opening a patient that has existing events. The popup will notify you that changing a field value will remove entered data, showing for what fields this is applicable. This pop-up is triggered when migrated data appears in fields that are not visible due to visibility conditions in the EBMT Registry (e.g. if the patient is not dead, you will not see the cause of death).
The message can be ignored now by pressing 'submit change'. In the next maintenance mode, which will take place May 14th-May17th, the data will be restored.




Upcoming maintenance modes
Due to maintenance or migrations the EBMT Registry will be closed on the following dates:
Dates
Reason
14/05/2024 - 17/05/2024

European Transplant and Cellular Therapy Online Registry (EuroTraCTOR)
EuroTraCTOR is an EU grant that was funded under the EU4Health programme 2021-2027 (grant number 101079887). The objective of the project is to design, develop and implement a new EBMT registry to improve the processes of collecting and using data across EU health systems. EBMT is a coordinating entity and counts with the support from other 10 project beneficiaries and 4 external expert organisations. The project started at the end of 2022 and has a duration of 30 months.


























About the project


The constant evolution of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) and cellular therapies requires the continuous development and improvement of information technology (IT) tools and features, as a prerequisite to adjust to new and innovative treatments and associated legal and technical requirements. In order to answer the current and future needs of the HCT stakeholders Professionals and Competent Authorities (CA)  the EBMT Registry requires a significant update of its structure and features.
The proposed development will enable the correct monitoring of HCT activities, patient and donor safety oversight, and recording/collecting quality, safety, and efficacy data. A new EBMT registry will be built based on the needs identified by HCT professionals and CA and aims to be as flexible as possible, allowing its customization at regional/federal levels to serve and adapt to different realities, in a user-friendly manner.
The future platform aims to provide an adequate answer to the requirements of clinicians/professionals involved in HCT and Cellular Therapies on one hand and other stakeholders such as CA or other health authorities on the other while complying with best practices associated with standardization and data protection (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR), ultimately enabling better health decisions leading to improved, outcomes and care for EU.

CAR-T Data Collection Initiative








Reporting is learning. By reporting data on patients treated with CAR T-cell therapies, you contribute to academic research and regulatory decision making by health authorities. Ultimately, this supports EBMTs mission to advance cellular and stem-cell based therapies and improve the lives of patients with blood-related disorders.
Data quality is fundamental to doing meaningful analyses. To ensure that we have complete and accurate data, EBMT invites centres that treat patients with commercial CAR T-cell therapies to participate in a Data Collection Initiativeto support Post Authorisation Safety (PAS) studies mandated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Centres that participate will be financially compensated.




How is the Data Collection Initiative set up to support PAS studies?
The data collection for PAS studies is based on the standard Registry forms and procedures, but a wider infrastructure is being set-up to support PAS studies and reimburse centres for their work.























 

















Background information With the approval of the first CAR-T therapies, the EMA required MAHs to monitor their products in the long-term. The cellular therapy module of the EBMT Registry received a positive qualification opinion from the EMA, supporting the use of Real-World Data captured in the EBMT Registry to inform regulatory decision making by health authorities. 

CAR-T therapies are a very promising treatment option for many patients with haematological malignancies. However, the evidence on the long-term safety and efficacy of these treatments is limited. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) obliges marketing authorisation holders (MAH, pharmaceutical companies) to conduct post authorisation safety (PAS) studies to monitor the long-term safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapies. These PAS studies are based on secondary use of EBMT Registry data. In 2019 the EMA issued a positive qualification opinion of the cellular therapy module of the EBMT Registry indicating that the Registry fulfills the essential needs to capture such data () and early 2020 the first PAS study protocols based on secondary use of EBMT Registry data were approved by the EMAs Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee. This means that the normal EBMT Registry forms and data collection procedures are used to collect data in support of regulatory decision making on various CAR-T products.
It is important for EBMT to support these PAS studies and be in the lead of the Real-World Evidence generation on CAR-T therapies. We believe that reporting is learning. At a centre level, data reporting can contribute to improved patient management. Moreover, we need data from all centres in Europe to be recorded in a central, academic registry to do meaningful analyses and to contribute to the global body of knowledge on CAR-T therapies.
The informal mantra of the EBMT Registry, collect data once, use it often, also applies to the CAR-T field. Data wont need to be reported to separate registries owned by the MAHs and EBMT, but only to the EBMT. This reduces data-entry burden. Moreover, data collection is harmonised for all CAR-T therapies. The standard data collection forms are used for the currently available CAR-T therapies and can also be used for many different CAR-T therapies in the future. This facilitates data entry and data comparability.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)



What are the requirements for participation in the Data Collection Initiative?


To participate in the Data Collection Initiative on CAR-T therapies, a centre must, first and foremost, report data on all patients treated with (commercial) CAR-T therapies in the EBMT Registry as per the standard data collection forms and processes (the Cellular Therapy form). This does not require any additional contracts and/or regulatory approvals. Consequently, this data collection is already ongoing and should continue.
Secondly, if needed, help the EBMT Clinical Study Unit with obtaining regulatory approval for the  which allows patients to also consent to share the data collected in the Registry with EBMTs collaboration partners including MAHs and health authorities.
Thirdly, (re-)consent patients with the updated informed consent form.
Finally, help to set up contracts between your centre and EBMT which allows EBMT to reimburse your site for the data management efforts. (See the question What contracts should my centre sign? below).





What does my centre have to do when participating in the Data Collection Initiative?



You will need to complete the standard patient data in the EBMT Registry from August 24 onwards. In addition, we ask you to comply with data requests (queries) to ensure completeness and quality of the data.
Data on patients treated with CAR-T therapies needs to be reported at the following time points: baseline, 100 days, 6 months and then yearly up until 15 years have passed and at that time a 15-year follow-up will be conducted.
Also, we ask you to consent patients with the , which asks patients to indicate whether they allow sharing of their data with EBMT collaboration partners and source data verification of their data.
ly patients who explicitly consent to share their data with collaboration partners will be included in the dataset that is shared with these parties. The centre should also be available for on-site monitoring visits.





Why should my centre participate? What is in it for me?


Participation in the Data Collection Initiative is important because reporting is learning. The PAS studies are mandated by EMA because we lack information on the long-term safety and efficacy profiles of CAR-T therapies. As a prominent European medical community, we want to be in the lead of evidence generation of these promising treatments. Collectively we can generate robust real-world evidence to support regulatory decision making as well as scientific studies.
The current protocols for the PAS studies are based on secondary use of Registry data. With this approach we prevent the creation of additional databases owned by marketing authorisation holders. The EBMT Registry makes data available to the scientific community and it avoids the need for centres to report data to multiple registries. By using a harmonised data collection form for cellular therapies, it will be easier to enter and compare data on different products.
Centres will receive a generous reimbursement for their data management efforts. This money will be given for all patients treated with commercial CAR-T therapies who (re-)consent to sharing their pseudonymised data with MAHs as per the Product -Specific Agreement between the participating site and EBMT.
If you have a good study proposal for a CAR-T-related study, you can submit it to the relevant  or the . When your proposal is selected/accepted, you will not only have access to the data from your centre but (indirectly) also to data from other centres in your country or the Registry as a whole. Working Parties have dedicated statisticians, data managers and study coordinators to support the conduct of the selected proposals.





What contracts should my centre sign?



The contracts for the Data Collection Initiative for the PAS studies are split in two parts; the Data Collection Master Agreement and the Product- Specific Agreement. The Data Collection Master Agreement governs the general data collection requirements that are identical for all CAR-T therapies. Whereas the shorter Product Specific Agreement specifies additional requirements for the individual CAR-T therapies. For each new product you will only need to sign a new Product-Specific Agreement.
By using this set-up, in which the Product-Specific Agreements are incorporated in the Data Collection Master agreement, we aim to reduce the time needed for contract negotiations and thus reduce the start-up timelines and burden for new cellular therapy products included in the Data Collection Initiative.
We also remind your centre to sign the  (JCA). This document governs all data processing activities between EBMT and the centre and is thus a prerequisite but not specific to participate in the CAR-T Data Collection Initiative. The JCA should be signed by all centres, including those who do not participate in the CAR-T Data Collection Initiative.





Will my centre be reimbursed?


If your centre has agreed to participate in the Data Collection Initiative and has signed the relevant contracts, your centre will be reimbursed for all patients treated with commercial CAR-T therapy products that (re-)consent to allow sharing of their data with the marketing authorisation holders and health authorities as per the stipulations in the Product-Specific Agreement. You will only be reimbursed for patients treated after the marketing approval date in the post-marketing setting and when good quality data is entered and can be shared with the MAHs. The specific details of the inclusion period and payment schedule is provided in each Product-Specific Agreement. In addition to the Agreements, EBMT will inform the sites which indications are contracted with the pharma company to get paid for those patients. When a new indication is contracted with the pharma company EBMT will inform the sites accordingly. In summary:

Joint Controllership Agreement with Centers with full EBMT Membership
EBMT is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of personal data that we obtain frompatients, members and employees. In this context, EBMT has developed a Joint Controllership agreement with Centers with full EBMT membership which describes the responsibilities concerning data protection of the data reported to EBMT.
At the same time, the agreement includes all the requirements established by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (GDPR) concerning data processing and controllership obligations for EBMT members and EBMT. This documenthas been produced by the EBMT GDPR working group, revised and endorsed by the EBMT legal advisors for compliance with GDPR, and finally approved by the EBMT Executive Committee.
It is of great importance that EBMT members who report data to the EBMT Registry sign this document and return it to the EBMT.

Joint Controllership Agreement for Data reporting to SFGM-TC and EBMT
EBMT encourages the use of this Joint Controllership Agreement for centres that wish to report to EBMT and SFGM-TC. It is of great importance that an institutional representative of the EBMT/SFGMTC centre member, which reports data to the EBMT and SFGM-TC Registries, signs this document and returns it to 
This document has been adapted to French speaking SFGM-TC centres located outside of France: Belgium, Switzerland, Lebanon and Algeria.






































Data Confidentiality
The confidentiality of the patient data stored in the Registry is of paramount importance to the EBMT and procedures are in place to ensure the data is transferred and stored with the highest possible level of security.
In addition to the above, the transfer or storage of confidential patient data must abide by the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereafter GDPR). As the EBMT is registered as a Dutch foundation, Dutch law applies to the EBMT, and we abide by the implementation of the European Union (EU) GDPR regulating how personal data is to be handled, through the Dutch application of this law.
The law regulating transfer of data within the EU does not cover countries outside EU/EEA (European Economic Area), and the EBMT must ensure that centres lying outside this zone agree to conform to the EU law as stated above.
The law requires that the patient consents to the data being transferred to the EBMT. In addition, if the centre intends to forward data, either directly or through the EBMT, to countries located outside the EU/EEA, they must ensure this is explicitly stated in the patient consent form. Please see examples of consent forms in the link below. It is the centres responsibility to ensure that the patient has consented before data is forwarded to the EBMT.

Data Collection





The EBMT requests from all member centres that all patients undergoing an HCT, treatment for aplastic anaemia, or any type of cellular therapy be registered in the EBMT Registry. The EBMT Registry Data Collection Forms aid the collection of all the data that is required to be submitted to the EBMT Registry.
Centres are responsible for ensuring that patients and donors consent to their data being transferred to the EBMT, prior to collecting data for submission to the EBMT. Informed consent templates and further instructions on obtaining informed consent can be found on the Informed Consent page.












Patient Registry Data Collection Forms


In order to collect data, the EBMT uses a set of Data Collection Forms (DCFs). These Data Collection Forms are referred to as the core dataset. This is the minimum essential data that must be provided by all EBMT Member centres for their consenting patients.
The forms are organised in the corresponding event types in the EBMT Registry. Completion guidelines are available for every Data Collection Form. An introduction document to the completion guidelines can be found

Data Sharing





EBMT shares EBMT Registry data with a number of companies, study groups, societies and organisations for data submission and data retrieval/research purposes, upon agreement and in line with GDPR requirements.










Data sharing for data submission purposes
In the spirit of facilitating data registration for centres, the EBMT can enter into data sharing agreements with organisations that centres collaborate with, that are willing to submit data to the EBMT on behalf of those centres. Such agreements also allow these organisations to access data already submitted by the centres to the EBMT, provided that the centres have made this request. The end result is that centres need to submit the same data only once, and can still fulfil their data provision commitments with other partners.
National Registries are a type of organisation with whom the EBMT has been sharing the Registry infrastructure for many years in a special partnership which has been very fruitful for all. The National Registries are independent from the EBMT and have access to data from centres in their respective countries and jurisdiction. These centres are either listed members of the National Registry or have requested explicitly that the EBMT share their data with a National Registry.
Most of these National Registries actively collaborate with the EBMT Registry in data collection and training of Data Managers. A small number of National Registries enter data on behalf of their centres. Please contact your National Registry if you require more information on their activities.
Another type of data sharing is the sharing of EBMT Registry patient records between centres where a patient had treatments. More information on this can be found in the under the section 'Access to patients given a prior treatment in another centre'.
Below you can see the countries where National Registries and EBMT are actively collaborating.

Data sharing for data retrieval/research purposes
A procedure is in place for study groups/societies/organisations that wish to access multiple centre data from the EBMT Registry for research purposes. The Data Sharing service is available to all centres that are members of the EBMT, and wish to share their data for research purposes. While currently this service is free, the EBMT reserves the right to charge study groups/societies/organisations for this service in the future. Centres will not be charged for this service.
Data sharing for research purposes is time-limited and subject to explicit request and approval by a centres PI as well as subject to approval by the EBMT. Please contact the Registry Helpdesk on  with your request for data sharing. An appropriate request form will be forwarded to you, depending on the type of data sharing requested.

Transplant Activity Survey





Since 1990, the EBMT has carried out the annual Transplant Activity Survey to prospectively collect numbers of patients treated with a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) according to indication, donor type and stem cell source. Any clinical units that perform any type of stem cell transplant can participate in the survey whether they are members of the EBMT or not.
The Transplant Activity Survey has become a tool for assessing the real picture of HSCT in Europe: exposing trends, illustrating the current status and providing essential data for counselling and planning. Its structure, standardised over many years, and the excellent commitment by the participating teams make it possible to observe changes over time and to evaluate factors associated with such changes. This Activity Survey is relevant to individual transplant teams, national organisations, health care agencies and the industry as well as patients. All transplant teams are strongly encouraged to join the survey.





When & How to submit survey data


Survey data requests are sent to the centres in December of the year being surveyed and are collected during the first half of the following year. The 2023 survey is now open, the deadline for submission of the 2023 data is the 1 April, 2024.
The data is captured via on-line survey(link is being sent to each centre individually by EBMT Activity Survey Team), whereby each transplanting team can report their entire annual activity by indication, donor type and stem cell source. It allows the reporting of first allografts, of first autografts (rows 1-32 and sum in row 33) and of additional transplants or retransplants performed due to disease progression, engraftment failure or as part of a planned multiple transplant protocol (row 34). Row 35 (all transplants) is the sum of row 33 + row 34.
Paediatric transplant activity (<18 years at transplant) can be reported both in the main table (row 1-32) by indication, donor type and stem cell source and additionally as a total number in row 36. Entering the total numbers of paediatric patients additionally in row 36, enables us to perform a separate analysis of the paediatric and adult data.
The total number of non-myeloablative (including RIC) allogeneic transplants, either first or non-first, can be reported in row 37.
The number of patients receiving un-manipulated donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in 2023 can be reported in row 38. Please enter your data in the field according to the main reason for giving the DLI therapy. Please report the number of patients and not the number of infusions.
Number of patients receiving Immunosuppressive Treatments (IST) for Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes (acquired and congenital) in 2023 can be reported in row 39. Please enter the number of patients treated with IST for Aplastic Anaemia (AA) and for other Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes separately.
Table 2 is dedicated to the reporting of non HSCT cell therapies.
Report the number of patients receiving cell therapies using manipulated or selected cells in your centre in 2023 by indication and donor type in rows 1-9. Report the number of patients and not the number of infusions: E.g., a patient with three NK infusions is counted as one patient. Cell therapies can be reported within or outside of the context of HSCT.
Please also report CAR-T patients treated in clinical trials, as this survey does not affect any confidentiality issues and provides an overview of how many therapies are performed in Europe each year.
For help in reporting, please read the Activity survey manual and Guidelines below or contact us.
Please submit your data using on-line survey.
If you are unable to submit your data via on-line survey please contact us.
How to submit your data by either mail or post:

How can I see the results?


Data from the most recent survey year are presented at the EBMT annual meeting and are available to participating teams and sponsors. If you are an EBMT Member and if you want to access the most recent data, please contact the Activity Survey Coordinator.
External persons or organisations may also apply for access to the survey data against payment of a fee. Please provide detailed information about the data required and its intended use to the Activity Survey Coordinator, who will assess the feasibility of the request before passing it on to the EBMT for approval and costing.
Please note that some of these data may not have been published and should be treated as confidential. It is for internal use only and may not be used for publication without obtaining prior consent.
Activity Survey data is published as a peer reviewed publication in Bone Marrow Transplantation each year. A full set of slides is prepared annually showing the trends and developments over the years. A selection of these slides is available on request. Individual analyses maybe requested by the EBMT Partners of Excellenceand participating teams upon justification of its use.

Post-transplant haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in patients who undergo allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)


Group

Infectious Diseases Working Party (IDWP)




Haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a common complication after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) referring to bleeding from the bladder mucosa due to urinary bladder inflammation. Early-onset HC has been associated with bladder mucosal damage by chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the conditioning phase, while late-onset HC in the peri-engraftment period is increasingly associated with BK polyoma virus infection.
Even though there have been significant developments in transplant practices over the last years, HC in transplant patients has not been investigated among EBMT centres in the last decade. Therefore, the current study aims to obtain information on both the practices and management, as well as the incidence and outcome, of HC in EBMT transplant patients.

Acute Leukaemia Working Party (ALWP)





The Acute Leukemia Working Party relies on a large registry based in Paris. It is devoted to the promotion and analyses of all primary and secondary myeloid and lymphatic acute leukemia aspects associated with the transplantation of stem cells from Autologous and all donor types including T deplete and T replete Haploidentical transplants as well as cord blood transplantation, including prospective and retrospective studies, and education in this field.

Over the last decades, studies conducted by ALWP members have yielded a significant amount of scientific knowledge, creating the basis for continuously improving patient care.
With the support of the different ALWP subcommittees' leaders (F. Ciceri, J. Esteve, S. Giebel, NC. Gorin, F. Baron, B. Savani and C. Schmid), the data managers (E. Polge, A. Mailhol, M. Houhou, E. Penisson (part time)), the help of invited Post Doc fellows, (Eder S. (Austria), Lorentino F. (Italy) and Sun Y. (China)), our dedicated statistician, M. Labopin, ALWP members and all EBMT participating centres, the studies portfolio of the ALWP has grown quickly, and generated an amazing number of published manuscripts and communications at major meetings such as the EBMT, ASH, EHA and ASBMT/CIBMTR Tandem meetings.

The huge scientific productivity of the ALWP over the past months is a good illustration of the success of EBMT strategy. We deeply believe in the capacity of the ALWP - with the support of and in cooperation with the other working parties and EBMT leadership - to continue facing new challenges successfully.

Severe Aplastic Anaemia Working Party (SAAWP)





The SAAWP reports on Aplastic Anaemia (AA) and other rare acquired and inherited bone marrow failure disorders.
The SAAWP provides essential data on outcomes after treatment from large numbers of patients that can only be obtained from large registries like the EBMT. It also provides important clinical information needed to help classify and characterise the disease and data on the natural history of the disease and late effects that occur after treatment. 
The SAAWP holds the Aplastic Anaemia (AA) database that is the only disease-specific database within the EBMT. Data are collected not only on patients receiving transplants but also other forms of therapy, including immunosuppressive therapy.

Autoimmune Diseases Working Party (ADWP)





The ADWP is dedicated to promoting clinical activities, teaching and translational research on autologous/allogeneic HSCT together with novel approaches of cellular therapy as specific treatment of severe Autoimmune Diseases (AD), in a specific challenge to re-induce self-tolerance by resetting the immune system.
The ADs section of the EBMT Registry is the largest database of its kind worldwide. ADs is recently facing a unique developmental phase across EBMT centres. Autologous HSCT has become an integral and standard-of-care part of treatment algorithms in multiple sclerosis (MS) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). Recently, novel cellular therapies (ie CART cells, mesenchymal cells) have been successfully adopted in ADs.
A multidisciplinary approach is key in this field, and the ADWP has the strategic task of interacting with other Autoimmune Diseases (AD) specialists and their respective scientific societies.

Cellular Therapy is an emerging medical science that is today facing a unique developmental phase, well documented by the outstanding and growing numbers of clinical trials. Such an exponential growth requires proper infrastructures, cell repositories, clinical registries, technical and regulatory guidelines for appropriate cell manipulation and validation of the innovative therapeutic approaches in multicentric clinical trials.
The CTIWP aims at fostering cellular therapy in Europe, through a continuous crosstalk between basic science findings, transplant immunobiology observations and implementation of cellular manufacturing approaches designed to answer unmet medical needs.
To this aim we will actively implement:
Retrospective and multicentric prospective transplant immunobiology studies
Retrospective and multicentric prospective clinical trials of cell/gene therapy
A map of European Centers active in cell manipulation and cell therapy
A dedicated registry for cellular products and clinical trials of cell and cell-based gene therapy.
These aims will be pursued through the activity of WP subcommittees and through an active collaboration with International and European Societies of Transplantation, Cell/Gene Therapy and with major investors in the field.

Chronic Malignancies Working Party (CMWP)





The Chronic Malignancies Working Party promotes and conduct educational activities and clinical investigations on the role of hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic malignancies such as chronic leukaemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative and plasma cell disorders.
The CMWP aims to contribute to improving outcomes for patients undergoing stem cell transplantation for chronic hematologic malignancies by the following means:
Performing high quality retrospective registry studies
Performing prospective clinical trials and non-interventional studies (NIS)
Improving the quality of EBMT registry data
Promoting scientific interaction by organising educational courses and scientific meetings
Collaborating with national and international transplant- and disease-specific groups
Disseminating knowledge to the transplant and non-transplant scientific communities, patient organisations and the lay public

Structure
The CMWP consists of five subcommittees:
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) including Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (CMML)
Plasma Cell Disease (PCD)
	CART PCD

Philadelphia-negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (Ph-neg MPN)
Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML)
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)
Each subcommittee will have a chair and one or two vice-chairs.
Vice-chairs should act as co-chairs and should be directly responsible for at least two studies. (Chairs of subcommittees should allocate at least two studies to each vice-chair)
The chair of the CMWP appoints the chairs and vice-chairs of subcommittees.
Subcommittee members who have served over four years on the board may be replaced to provide opportunities for other interested WP members.
It is a goal of the current chair to have the board reflect the international range of EBMT-affiliated centres.





Membership
Working Party membership is open to all physicians in EBMT-affiliated Transplant Centres.
Applicants from elsewhere are welcome to apply to join. The final decision will rest with the Chair of the Working Party. The secretary maintains the list of members.
If a member has not attended any meeting for two years, they will be deemed to have left the Working Party and will no longer receive group email communications from the Secretary.

Lymphoma Working Party (LWP)





The LWP is devoted to advancing research and promoting education regarding the role of stem cell transplantation in the management of patients with lymphoid malignancies.
The LWP is composed of a panel of experts on Hodgkin lymphoma and non Hodgkin lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphomas, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia. The panel is supported by the excellent help of Herv Finel and Irma Khvedelidze, Study Coordinators, and Ariane Boumendil, Statistician.
The joint effort of the team has resulted in a very active portfolio of ongoing studies and numerous presentations in international meetings and publications in peer-reviewed journals. This includes both retrospective and prospective studies, as well as guidelines and position papers.

The management of patients with lymphoma has changed extraordinarily in the last 10-15 years. The advent of rituximab has resulted in a significant improvement in the outcome of several types of lymphoma. More recently, a plethora of new agents with a very strong biological rational is becoming available for the treatment of patients with lymphoid malignancies. In parallel, advances in haematopoietic cell transplantation technology, such as reduced toxicity conditioning, haplo-transplantation, and CAR T cell therapy have improved the outcome and widened the applicability of stem cell transplantation in lymphoma, particularly for elderly patients and those without a matched donor.
The challenge is to continuously define the appropriate place for stem cell transplant in the therapeutic algorithm of patients with lymphoma in concert with the novel pharmacological options. With the largest database of patients that have undergone a stem cell transplant for lymphoma combined with the expertise of the transplant community, the LWP is in a privileged position to contribute to this aim.

Transplant Complications Working Party (TCWP)





The aim of the Transplant Complications Working Party is to conduct research as well as provide education and expertise on the subject of non-infectious complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation. The major fields of interest of the TCWP are:
Early complications e.g. graft failure, VOD/SOS, transplant-associated microangiopathy (TAM), other endothelial syndromes, impact of co-morbidities, toxicity of conditioning regimen and supportive care;
Acute and chronic graft versus host disease  all the aspects from risk factors through diagnosis to treatment;
Late effects  e.g. infertility, sexual dysfunction, secondary cancers, organ-specific late complications, quality of life.
The TCWP is a transversal Working Party, covering complications occurring after transplantation for all the indications. Therefore, its performance is strictly related to collaboration with disease-specific working parties, and studies directly dedicated to non-infectious complications should be performed either in or in close collaboration with TCWP.

Haemoglobinopathies Working Party (HWP)





A new era of hemoglobinopathies treatment began 40 years ago when allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation provided the first cure for these genetic conditions. Over 10,000 patients have received transplants since then and currently, gene therapy is at the beginning of a new era. As a result, patients suffering from hemoglobinopathies now have several therapeutic options to choose from.
In the new Hemoglobinopathies Working Party (HWP), we have the potential to redefine transplant journey modalities and compare different options in order to choose the best option for our patients.






The main objectives of the HWP will be to:


Promote scientific activity by involving investigators around the world, especially from areas where these diseases are prevalent
Collaborate closely with other WPs and Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease specialists and associations
Improve data collection quality with a view to long-term clinical benefits

Biostatistics in the EBMT





Statistical expertise and support in the EBMT are provided by the group of Statisticians and the Statistical Committee.
The statisticians are employed either by the Paris or the Leiden Study Units. 
The Statistical Committeeis a group of scientists with a keen interest in biostatistics for stem-cell transplant, regardless of their employment by EBMT. The task of the Statistical Committeeis to safeguard the quality of methodological activities and education.
The Paris and Leiden Study Units cooperate and exchange methodological knowledge, and work together in the Statistical Committee, to disseminate their knowledge throughout the EBMT.








Support for EBMT Studies
In the development of clinical research, the statistician is responsible of the adherence of the study to the methodological standards for sound scientific research. This is achieved by analyzing the data with proper statistical techniques but more importantly by contributing to the planning of the study, interpretation and communication of the results, acting as scientific fellow of the Principal Investigator.
EBMT Studies are conducted within the Working Parties and through the Paris and Leiden EBMT Data Offices.
Proposals are evaluated and refined by the WP Chair and WP members, in collaboration with the data managers and the statisticians
The statistical analysis of an approved study is done by the WP statistician according to availability of resources and WP priorities. In some cases, the WP statisticians might cooperate with an external statistician as advisor / reviewer.

The EBMT Educational Programme


The EBMT Educational Programme plays a central role in advancing knowledge, promoting best practices, and fostering professional development in the field of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) and Cellular Therapies (CT) through:
1. Standardising education: The EBMT educational programme assumes a pivotal role in developing and standardising educational content on HCT and CT. By establishing consistent and high-quality educational materials, this programme actively contributes to providing healthcare professionals across diverse regions with a consistent level of education.

Nurses Group - Who we are





Over the last two decades, with the support of medical colleagues, BMT nursing has grown rapidly and has acknowledged the need for care of the patients, their families and donors. Nurses have been taking a leading role in the holistic care of patients; BMT nurses are involved in the decision-making process about treatment options for their patients, and they evidently contribute to an enhancement in their patients' quality of life. Learn more below about our Board, our Committees, and the National Groups and Regional Forums.

Working Party Nurses





Vital in keeping close contact with the EBMT Working Parties (WP) and their scientific agendas are the Working Party Nurses. WP Nurses manage both the nursing research and nursing education activity within the WP, under the supervision of the Research Committee (RC) and the Scientific Committee (SC) respectively. As such, WP Nurses contribute to the research and education agenda of the EBMT NG RC, SC and Working Party. In addition, WP Nurses offer support and guidance in the development of research studies and educational initiatives and promote opportunities for nursing research within the WP by collaboration and dissemination.

Nurses Group Scientific Committee





The Scientific Committee (SC) is a dedicated group of experienced nurses from all over Europe with specific interests in haematology and stem cell transplantation. They complement each other through their different specialties, from working as a nurse specialist, nurse coordinator or as a nurse on a hospital ward, apheresis unit, outpatient clinic and/or consultation unit.
The Scientific Committee is responsible for the nurse-oriented scientific program at the EBMT Annual Meeting. This 4-day meeting takes place every year in March or April in a different European country. The members begin planning the EBMT Annual Meeting in May. In November they meet again to review all the submitted abstracts from nurses and allied health care professionals who would like to present their research, nursing projects or other developing work in the field of haematologic stem cell transplantation at the annual meeting.

Committee Objectives


The ambition of the Nurses Group is that all nurses and allied health care professionals, regardless of their experience within the field of haematologic stem cell transplantation, learn something new at the annual EBMT meetings. The aim is to empower them to bring home some improvement ideas so that the quality of care is enhanced in their own practice.
A second aim is to engender confidence in presenting a poster or oral session in both new and experienced nurses and allied health care professionals.

Nurses Group Education





The EBMT Nurses Group firmly believes that by investing more in research and education together with other EBMT Working Parties and Committees, care for patients can be improved. This forms the basis of the groups primary objectives. Furthermore, the Board has taken the initiative to get more involved in the Educational Committee in order to work on combined education and contribute to the EBMT Handbook.
Our educational projects have included work on Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP), Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), Adherence and Compliance in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), and Bone Health in Multiple Myeloma (MM), among others.



Learning Programmes
The EBMT Nurses Group has developed a number of Learning Programmes on topics such as Immune Thrombocytopenia and CML that can be downloaded as modules and studied at your leisure as E-learning programmes. Click on each to learn more and gain access to the materials.










Practical Guides
The Nurses Group has also created several sets of Practical Guides for nurses andhealth care professionals on a variety of topics and in a variety of languages. Click the links below to access the materials.








Immune Effector Cell for Nurses
This new forum has been created to provide Nurses and AHPs involved in the care of patients being treated with IEC Therapy with a platform to learn from and communicate with their colleagues from around the globe. The forum not only includes multiple discussion spaces, but also news and updates from The EBMT, and a bank of recommended publications and useful resources to support your professional practice.
The goal of the forum is to create a community for professionals working in IEC Therapy, to enable this goal we have made the forum open to EBMT members as well as non-members.







Web Learning
A number of the presentations from past events can be accessed online through various E-Materials platforms. Visit the links to the event that interests you.
The EBMT Nurses Group publishes The EBMT Nurses' Textbook, the first book written for and by nurses working in the HSCT field.










Webinars
Beginning in April 2020, EBMT and LABMT will begin offering live webinars for nurses, hosted by experts, for all EBMT and LABMT members.

The Immune Effector Cell Forum













            Welcome to The IEC Forum!
          

"I would like to invite nurses and AHPs working in the area of Immune Effector Cells to join the EBMT IEC forum.
We are all in the position to learn from each other in this rapidly evolving area of cellular therapy. I am looking forward to seeing the forum develop." - Ruth Clout,Cell Therapy and Immunobiology Working Party Nurse.






What is the aim of the forum?
The aim of the forum is to create a global support network for nurses and allied health professionals (AHPs) involved in the care of patients being treated or potentially being treated with Immune Effector Cell Therapy at all stages of the patient pathway. This will also include nurses and AHPs at referring centres and those with an interest in this area.
This will be a predominantly web-based resource with areas that are both publicly available and some password protected private sections to foster an open dialogue where nurses and AHPs can seek peer support in a less public environment.




What does the forum Include?















The forum is designed to be a space where professionals working in the space of IEC can form a community and have open dialogues about their practice.
To support this we have created forum spaces under a variety of topics, such as; referrals, toxicities, follow-up care, and late complications. Alongside these topics, members are encouraged to share and start their own discussions.
We hope this space will provide you with opportunities to connect with your colleagues from around the world, in a way you haven't been able to before.

The field is ever-changing, to support our members we will be providing relevant updates from The EBMT on the topic of Immune Effector Cells. These are all located in one space and are easily accessible for all members within the IEC Forum.

Finding relevant publications is time consuming, to remedy this we have created a space where you will have access to a continuously evolving list of recommended publications on the topic of Immune Effector Cells. We are constantly updating this list and hope it will be of use to you and your practice.
We encourage members to discuss their thoughts on these publications in the forum space.

We have included a space where you will be able to access a range of educational resources that our experts recommend for your professional development. Like all aspects of this forum, new and exciting resources will be added as the forum develops.






How do I access the E-learning Platform?
The IEC Forum is open to EBMT members and non-members on The EBMT E-learning Platform.
To access the forum you will need to enroll as a user, you can refer to the tutorials below for help in doing this.

JACIE Standards










The Standards are the cornerstone of the JACIE accreditation program. Believing that quality care can only be achieved if both clinical and laboratory issues are effectively addressed, the FACT-JACIE Standards are the only set of requirements that include both clinical and laboratory practices. The Standards currently apply to Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPC) obtained from bone marrow, peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood.

8th edition of FACT-JACIE Standards





See  and other information on the 8th edition.
The FACT-JACIE International Standards for Hematopoietic Cellular Therapy Product Collection, Processing, and Administration, eighth edition includes hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), nucleated cells or mononuclear cells from any hematopoietic tissue source collected for therapeutic use other than as HPCs, immune effector cells (IECs), and genetically modified cells.
This the sixth collaboration to publish comprehensive quality-based Standards in cellular therapy between the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT) and JACIE, the Joint Accreditation Committee of ISCT and EBMT of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). FACT was founded in 1996 by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) and the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT), published the first edition of Hematopoietic Cell Standards that year, and initiated the North American inspection and accreditation program based on these Standards in 1997. JACIE was established in 1999, adopted the first edition of FACT Standards, and jointly reviewed the second edition in 2002. Subsequent editions of Standards have been jointly developed, approved, and published by FACT and JACIE.
The objective of the FACT-JACIE International Standards for Hematopoietic Cellular Therapy Product Collection, Processing, and Administration is to promote quality medical and laboratory practice in hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation and therapies using hematopoieticderived cellular products. FACT-JACIE Standards are unique in depth and breadth, being applicable to all phases of cell collection, processing, storage, transportation, and administration, and to all phases of clinical application including standard of care therapies and products, products administered under regulatory-approved clinical trials, and licensed (or other regulatory approval) products.

Applicants










Accreditation is the means by which a centre can demonstrate that it is performing a required level of practice in accordance with agreed standards of excellence and certify that it operates an effective quality management system.












If you are applying to JACIE for first time or for a re-accreditation, you are encouraged to download and read the JACIE Applicants Guide. The Applicants Guide gives a general overview of the JACIE Accreditation process - taking you from the initial stage of thinking about applying for JACIE, through the Inspection process, to achieving JACIE Accreditation.
For those looking for guidance in establishing a Quality Programme in their center, the Quality Management Guide is designed to assist in the development and maintenance of a Quality programme for the area of Peripheral Blood and Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation.



















Additionally, on the 20/10/2023 JACIE launched an e-learning course designed for centres who are starting, or already on, their JACIE accreditation journey - whether this be for the first or fifth time. This course aims to help all staff working in centres feel more confident in preparing for and undergoing the JACIE Inspection by addressing many of the frequently asked
questions.







JACIE makes use of the Sharepoint environment to share documents with inspectors and centres: in order to conduct a process JACIE offers a license free of cost for Office 365. There is a guide available for the users to check their access to the Microsoft Office 365 services.





















How to apply
The steps to apply for accreditation are:
Submit an application form.
Sign the Accreditation Agreement with the EBMT
Submit the pre-inspection documentation
Go through the on-site inspection & receive the Inspection Report
Attend to reporting and corrective actions (where these are indicated)
Receive accreditation and maintain accreditation
For first-time applicants, the form and checklist give JACIE the necessary information to assess if your centre is eligible for accreditation and to understand the structure of your centre or programme and relationships with other institutions.
For renewal applications, you may submit the Inspection Checklist at a later stage of the reapplication process, together with the pre-inspection documentation.
Note that it is always important to start completing the checklist before you submit the application form to reduce the amount of time required when preparing the inspection documentation.
Note thatAccredited Centres are no longer required to submit an Annual Report. They are, however, required to proactively inform JACIE of any changes in their centre or to their program. More information and the Changes Form are available in Step 6 on the.



















Translation of Center's documents


Documents should be in the language spoken in your centre since JACIE would expect to assign inspectors that speak and understand that language. However, there may be exceptions to this:
 Centre is located in a country where no inspectors are available; OR
 JACIE may not have inspectors anywhere that speak the centres language; OR
 The transplant community in a given country has requested that only external inspectors be assigned, to avoid conflicts of interest
In these cases, we must resort to other inspectors to perform the inspection. For these inspectors, one of the key parts of their preparation is reading documents made available in advance. Without these documents, it is very difficult for them to arrive on-site adequately prepared, and this would clearly affect the quality of the inspection.
In such cases, JACIE will ask the centre to translate a selection of the documents provided to the inspectors in advance of the inspection and will request the centre to provide local experts to facilitate interviews and understanding of documentation. Please contact the Accreditations Coordinator at  if you have any concerns at all about this part of the process.




English/Spanish Glossary of terms


The Alliance for Harmonisation of Cellular Therapy Accreditation (AHCTA) and Worldwide Network for Blood & Marrow Transplantation (WBMT) along with the Latin American Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation (LABMT) have facilitated the preparation of a simple glossary of quality management terminology to help create awareness and understanding of basic but important quality management terminology among Spanish-speaking transplant professionals.





External consultants


There are many providers and companies offering consultancy services for implementing quality management in healthcare. Many offer preparation for JACIE accreditation among their services. These providers usually offer their services in return for a fee paid by the hospital.
While it is recognised that such providers often perform valuable services and enable transplant programmes to prepare themselves for accreditation, it should be noted that neither JACIE nor EBMT endorse individual providers. Any organisation that is considering using such services should inform itself fully about providers' capacity, knowledge and experience in the same way as it would assess any other service.




Quality Managers


For centres that are members of the EBMT, the standard membership fee of 900 per annum includes a quality manager at no additional cost.
Check with your team, and if you are not already included, ask your Principal Investigator to request the EBMT Executive Office to add you to the membership listing by writing to .

Inspectors










Inspectors are the backbone of JACIE; without them, there is no accreditation process. Becoming an inspector is a wonderful way to contribute to maintaining global quality standards, and we offer a discount on accreditation for centres whose staff have participated in an inspection event(s) in the 4 years prior to submission.

JACIE Inspector Handbook





This Handbook is the best reference for inspectors to help guide them through all the stages of a JACIE inspection.
JACIE inspectors are volunteers who work in the field of stem cell transplantation in clinical, quality management (QM), nursing or scientific roles. There are specific entry requirements for would-be inspectors and defined job descriptions for the different inspector roles (Clinical, Collection, Processing and QM). Some inspectors may be qualified to inspect more than one area. For example, a clinician might be qualified to inspect both clinical and collection facilities. All inspectors are asked to commit to 1-2 inspections per year.
The JACIE approach to using volunteer subject-matter experts, has been vital to the transplant community accepting and embracing the inspection process, as the inspectors are part of the community and peers of the clinicians and Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) working within the centres. This has also allowed the transplant community to use JACIE to educate Centres on quality management system working and best practice within the field of cell therapy. Moreover, it has helped to standardise practice and support an ethos of continuous improvement within transplant programmes.
This handbook is intended to be a ready reference for inspectors to help guide them through the tasks and responsibilities throughout all stages of a JACIE inspection.

Current Inspectors








The following public list of JACIE inspectors is monthly updated.














Inspection Documents
Inspections & Interim Audit
The following resources detail the inspection process and will facilitate your participation in inspections, as well as provide information about continuing education.



















Logistics
Our travel agency, BCD Travel, will get in contact with the inspectors after the JACIE office confirms the inspection date. They might request some information (departure city, any restrictions) and will propose an itinerary and accomodation that the inspector needs to confirm. Inspectors are always requested to arrive the previous evening.









JACIE makes use of the Sharepoint environment to share documents with inspectors and centres: in order to conduct a process JACIE offers a license free of cost for Office 365. There is a guide available for the users to check their access to the Microsoft Office 365 services.














Additional Guides & References
There are additional guides and handbooks relating to quality management available in the Document Centre. You can also peruse the list of external resources we have compiled.










Inspectors Online Forum
A LinkedIn group dedicated to JACIE inspectors has been set up. Note that access is only offered to registered inspectors. The Group's success depends on how willing members are to participate, so please feel free to raise questions and generate discussion.

Inspector Committee





The JACIE Inspector Committee (JIC) is an important committee promoting the JACIE Accreditation Programme by helping to develop strategies for maintaining and improving the high level and quality of inspections making recommendations for retaining a committed, high performing pool of inspectors and recruiting new inspectors. 
Inspectors are the backbone of JACIE and the accreditation process, providing their time and expertise voluntarily. The committee has an influential role within the JACIE Accreditation Process in terms of advancing the inspection process, the inspector pool and in the strategic support for continuing training and education.

The EBMT Registry





The EBMT Registry, established in 1974, is the backbone of the EBMTs research and educational activities. It provides a pool of data to haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) healthcare professionals to perform studies, assess epidemiological trends, and ultimately improve the care of patients with haematological malignancies and other life-threatening disorders.
As of 2023, the EBMT Registry has acquired data on over 700,000 patients that received an HCT procedure as well as data on over 4,000 patients that received CAR T-cell therapy. All thanks to the reporting done by our members, who in order to retain full EBMT membership status, they must report all consecutive HCTs each year.
The EBMT Registry contains patient clinical data, including aspects of the diagnosis and disease, first-line treatments, HCT or cell-therapy-associated procedures, transplant type, donor type, stem cell source, complications and outcome. Patients are followed up indefinitely. Basic donor information is included with these procedures, and donor follow-up data can be entered by the transplant centre (or Donor Registry, for unrelated donors).
All EBMT Registry studies are performed under the supervision of the EBMT Working Parties.

Information for Patients & Donors





Improving patients lives is the ultimate objective of the EBMT community. While we are not a patient organisation, we are focused on strengthening our connection with patients by making relevant EBMT information more accessible and further explaining the role of important EBMT resources such as The Patient & Donor Registry and our JACIE accreditation body. This page is designed to introduce you to some of the materials that we hope will be of interest.

Since 1974, it has gathered information on haematopoietic stem cell transplantation procedures, with explicit permission from patients, and provides a pool of data to EBMT members to perform studies, prepare trials, and further knowledge in the field. Its ultimate aim is to improve quality of life and outcome for patients.

Patient Engagement
Patients, caregivers, donors and health care professionals (HCPs) have complementary strengths and a common goal: optimal outcome after transplantation and cell therapy.
The EBMT Patient Engagement taskforce has been created to promote the active participation of hematopoietic cell transplantation and cell therapy recipients within EBMT. 









Patient Advocacy
The EBMT established the Patient Advocacy Committee to ensure that patient perspectives are integrated in EBMT activities.














            Patients and patient advocates involved in HSCT and who are interested in the activities of the EBMT can become Individual Members at a reduced fee
          






JACIE Accreditation information
What does JACIE accreditation mean for patients?
JACIE accreditation offers patients reassurance that a transplant unit is working in line with international standards and has undergone a rigourous inspection process. JACIE establishes minimum requirements for facilities, education and training, quality management, donor and patient management and care, and good cell collection and laboratory practice.



Endorsed by the experts


JACIE is a joint initiative of the European Group for Blood & Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT), the two leading scientific organisations in the area of cellular therapy. Both associations are not-for-profit entities.




International standards


JACIE Accreditation is based on the FACT-JACIE International Standards that are prepared by leading experts from North America, Europe and other regions.





National regulations


JACIE accreditation has been incorporated into national regulations in several European countries and is included in a number of national guidelines for bone marrow transplantation. In 2004, JACIE received support from the European Union (EU). An independent review of the EU-funded projects from that period highlighted the success of JACIE and its importance.





Experience


JACIE has received applications from centres and facilities in more than 20 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia and has performed more than300 inspections since 2000. JACIE inspectors are all experts in the BMT field.

Haemoglobinopathies Working Party (HWP)



 


By Emanuele Angelucci, Haemoglobinopathies Working Party Chair
As is widely recognised, thalassaemia stands out as one of the most significant and devastating health challenges globally, contributing to tens of thousands of new cases each year.
Over the past decade, the prognosis of thalassaemia has undergone a remarkable improvement, thanks to the collective efforts of researchers, doctors, and patient associations. This collaborative endeavour has transformed thalassaemia from a once lethal childhood disease into a manageable chronic condition, characterised by a prolonged survival and open prognosis. However, this progress necessitates substantial medical resources.
For over three decades, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has offered a potential cure for patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia, albeit with constraints such as donor availability and procedural risks, particularly among adult patients. Recently, the long-envisioned prospect of gene therapy has transitioned from theoretical discussions to tangible reality in clinical trials, presenting itself as a promising option for patients.
In 2023, the EBMT established a dedicated Working Party focusing on haemoglobin disorders, including transfusion-dependent thalassaemia and sickle cell disease. The Haemoglobinopathies Working Party strives to promote the global dissemination of curative treatment modalities, such as transplantation and gene therapy, enhance clinical research endeavours, formulate indication criteria, and improve the standard of care. Currently, six studies are underway, with many more in the pipeline.
The  is deeply committed to fostering close collaboration with thalassaemia specialists and patient associations. Recognising that true optimisation of patient care can only be achieved through the amalgamation of efforts, knowledge, and enthusiasm, the Working Party endeavours to identify the most suitable treatment options for each patient, at the right time.
"Empowering Lives, Embracing Progress: Equitable and Accessible Thalassaemia Treatment for All" encapsulates the shared objective of all medical associations engaged in this complex and compelling healthcare domain.
Watch the interview of representatives from the HWP who discuss howtreatment has developed over the last 40 years, the current treatment landscape and why they feel hopeful for patients in the future.

EBMT President







Foreword by the EBMT President 2022 was a very productive year for the EBMT community. Anna Sureda is looking back at what EBMT achieved in terms of science, education and patient care. She is also taking the opportunity to thank all the parties involved: the EBMT Staff, Board, centres and individual members, our partners from around the world for their constant work and dedication to our society.  

Last year, 2022, was a very productive one for the EBMT community. We were ready to see each other again and for the so-called new normal but, disappointingly, thein Prague had to switch to a virtual meeting. Although, that did not stop us. During the second half of last year, EBMT has been successful in bringing many of us together at events across Europe. Theas well as the have been very well attended and have represented an excellent opportunity for in-person networking and interaction. My sincere gratitude goes out to all the active members of the Trainee Committee that have naturally incorporated a rejuvenated flavour to all these activities. But as I write this message, I cannot help but get excited about the  which will be hosted in Paris and online from 23-26 April 2023. I hope you all choose to attend either in-person or virtually.
Another significant part of our activities in 2022 have consisted of the promotion and the development of scientific, educational and partnership opportunities related to the use of CAR T-cells. There has been an exponential increase in reporting CAR T-cell therapies and we can very proudly say that we have reached more than 4,000 CAR T- cell treated patients within the EBMT Registry (visit our  webpage for more information). Moreover, the successful resolution of  with three new winning projects, together with the increasing numbers of retrospective analysis being performed under the umbrella of the EBMT Working Parties will, without any doubt, bring additional research and help improve the management and long-term follow-up of this new treatment modality in Europe. Also worth mentioning is the fact that EBMT has managed to keep the positive opinion of EMA regarding the cellular therapy module. The  are actively being conducted by our society with five of them ongoing of four additional ones in the start-up/contracting phase. As you can see with all our activities, we are keen on staying at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field.
Partnerships and collaborations have also represented a major asset for our community. During our regular meetings with the representatives of the National Societies for haematopoietic cell transplantation and cellular therapy, we have fostered a deeper level of interaction and closer communication, finished the governance charter of the EBMT-EHA , consolidated our educational activities, and harmonised the accreditation process for CAR T-cell centres together with our industry partners. EBMT and EHAs collaboration has also been crystallised at the which propelled both societies to host a wonderful hybrid meeting in Rotterdam in February of this year (). Nonetheless, the collaborative spirit of EBMT goes beyond European borders. The Joint Scientific Retreat from EBMT and ASTCT has been one of the best examples; three days of excellence, sharing of knowledge, learning about challenging concepts, and giving scientific and career advice. Likewise, the collaboration with China was amplified last year with theheld in November 2022. In addition, we have witnessed an increasing number of Chinese centres becoming full members of the EBMT as well as their scientific collaborative output. It brings me great joy to know our community is growing and our activities are having a greater impact year after year.
In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the devastating impact it had on civilians and patients in the affected regions, EBMT immediately set up an initiative called the. It has been continuously active throughout 2022 and has constructed a discussion forum of potential candidates for cellular therapy strategies. Unfortunately, though, the war continues. Last year, 2022, has left many dead, many families divided, and others homeless. It continues to constitute one of the most important humanitarian crises in recent years. EBMT will continue to support the Ukrainian people always from the mission and vision of our society and we will continue to encourage the transfer of scientific knowledge among all our members.
JACIE, after the pandemic, had clear challenges to resolve. However, I have already seen a high level of enthusiasm and commitment of everyone involved to find solutions to these challenges and current processes. Their work does not go unnoticed. The JACIE team completed 64 full inspections out of the 80 initially expected. Moving forward, the second EBMT benchmarking exercise has paved the way for a second manuscript (published in March 2023). Yet, the feasibility, acceptability and reliability of the system has been supported and the limitations have been identified. I cannot wait to see the impact JACIE and its team will have in 2023.
Looking ahead, we must remain committed to completing our current projects but at the same time, also embrace and execute new ones. Certainly, each one of us is concentrating on the EBMT Registry upgrade project, which will be launched late summer of 2023. Plus, we will focus on the recently EU funded  project which will unquestionably strengthen the links between EBMT and the National Registries/Societies in terms of data harmonisation and sharing. We are also passionately working on finalising EBMTs Strategic Plan for 2023-2026, which emphasises renovating and upgrading the way EBMT is approaching Science, Education and Quality of Care and Accreditation in order to make the society more aligned with our partners and stakeholders needs.
Still, none of these achievements could have been possible without your collaboration and efforts. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all the EBMT Staff, EBMT Board, EBMT centres and individual members, plus all our partners from around the world for your constant work and dedication to our society. With a strong community, our story in 2023 can be even more successful.
Thank you very much!

The EBMT Textbook for Nurses





New translations of the EBMT Nurses Textbook to Italian, French, and German are now available!
A Spanish translation is also coming soon.
This Open Access Second Edition textbook, endorsed by the EBMT, provides adult and pediatric nurses with a full and informative guide covering all aspects of transplant nursing including a new chapter dedicated to cellular therapy, nursing implications and care. This book takes the reader from basic principles to advanced concepts on a journey through the history of transplant nursing, including essential and progressive elements to help nurses improve their knowledge and benefit the patient experience, as well as a comprehensive introduction to research and auditing methods. This second edition specifically intended for nurses, complements the EBMT Handbook, a popular educational resource originally developed in 2003 for physicians to accompany an annual training course also serving as an educational reference tool in its own right.
This title is designed to develop the knowledge of nurses in transplantation. It is the only one of its kind written by nurse experts, specifically targeted at nurses in this specialist field and acknowledges the valuable contribution that nursing makes to patient care in this area. This new volume presents updated content that is essential for the education of nurses new to transplantation, while also offering a valuable resource for more experienced nurses who wish to refresh their knowledge.

EBMT Online Learning Course for Nurses
The EBMT Nurses e-learning program has been transformed from the successful EBMT Nurses Textbook and has been developed by and for nurses with an interest in Haematopoietic Cell Transplantation. It brings together the knowledge of nursing leaders in HCT and nursing care to provide nurses with a comprehensive and informative guide covering all aspects of transplant nursing, from basic principles to advanced concepts. It takes the learner on a journey through the history of transplant nursing, presenting concepts to help nurses improve their patients experience. It also explores research and auditing methods.
The ultimate goal of this e-learning is to support the EBMT Nurses Group's objective of improving the care of patients receiving HCT.
EBMT Online Learning Course for Nurses is available on the e-learning platform and open to all public.

JACIE Accredited Centres





This page features two lists. The first list shows all of the centres with valid accreditation (valid meaning not yet expired). The second list shows those centres that have formally requested accreditation and who are at some stage of the process. This includes having applied, awaiting inspection, inspected awaiting report, or in the corrections phase. This list makes no assessment of the centres' compliance with the Standards.Both lists are updated on a monthly basis.
JACIE Report of accredited Centers: Please note that as part of the response to the COVID19 pandemic, an extension was awarded as a once-off or unique measure to all those centres whose accreditation was still valid after 31 March 2020. This extension is already incorporated into the Accreditation time periods shown in the Report. Accrediation awards issued after 1 April 2020 reverted to the standard 4-year period.
JACIE Report of Centres in process: Thosecentres are listed as "In Process" in a separate list from the Accredited centres. This is referred to as "coverage", a term limited to acknowledging that a given centre is in the accreditation process without having achieved accreditation. A letter stating their current status can berequested from the JACIE office by the centre by writing to

Patient Privacy Statement 





Patient Personal Data Protection Statement
The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) maintains an international medicaldatabase known as the EBMT Registry. The Registry goes back to the beginning of the 1970s and contains clinical data including aspects of the diagnosis, first line treatments, haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) or cell therapy associated procedures, complications and outcome. 
This document details what personal data EBMT collects, how it is collected and stored and the purposes for which it is used. There is also information on how to contact the registry and the rights of individual data subjects. It was generated in response to new legislation, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereafter GDPR).
A registry is considered a separate type of data collection by privacy authorities. The importance for coupling information from registries in order to obtain new knowledge of great value is explicitly recognized (consideration 157 GDPR). The GDPR applies to usage of personal data for research and calls for interpreting the research purpose in a broad manner including for instance applied research (consideration 159 GDPR).
Why is Patient Data collected?
The EBMT Registry collects data for research and development of new and improved transplant, cell therapy and immunosuppression procedures, and to improve the quality of these procedures through the accreditation of treatment units. 
You can find the information of all EBMT studies in which your personal data might be used, by visiting our website on the following page: 
How is personal data obtained?
The EBMT works in partnership with local healthcare providers to collect data on patients undergoing bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, cell therapies, and immunosuppressive treatments for any disease. 
Following the GDPR, and to ensure the maximum accordance with the law of all EU/EEA nations, personal data of patients residing in EU member countries shall only be used for research through EBMT when appropriate informed consent is ensured. This has been common practice for many years already.
The informed consent is collected by the individual centres or donor registries submitting data to the EBMT to make certain that the respective national laws are followed. EBMT makes patient consent a prerequisite for submitting the data and provides all necessary information about usages of the data, to ensure appropriate consent is obtained in all cases.
What personal data is sent to the EBMT Registry?
Data collected to identify a person is limited to the hospital UPN (Unique Patient Number), patient initials, date of birth, and gender. These items are the minimal personal data necessary to ensure that medical data collected at different times is accurately stored in the same record. They are not used for identification of the individual and stored separately as enhanced security.
This process of separate storage is known as pseudonymisation[i] and is defined in the GDPR regulations. Each patients report is given a unique and non-informative database number (Unique Identity Code) which is the one used for research purposes. A minimum amount of patient personal data is necessary for this type of registries, contributing to the accuracy of the data, and therefore contributing to improvements in care and outcome. 
How is personal data processed?
The EBMT ensures that all personal data under its responsibility is processed according to the GDPR:
Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;
Collected for scientific research legitimate purposes;
Processed adequately, relevantly and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed;
Accurate and up to date;
Kept for an unlimited period in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no other purpose than historical, statistical or scientific research purposes;
Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data through technical and organisational measures.
Where is the Personal Data Stored?
The data is stored in an electronic database located in a European country. Only European countries that follow the GDPR, regardless of whether they are members of the European Union or not, can host the data. The database is protected by safeguards that ensure security, including compliance with NEN7510/ISO27001 certification. The data will only be accessible by the EBMT employees for the performance of their job following a stringent access control policy
Personal Data Transfers
The EBMT works with many researchers on international collaborations across scientific or clinical institutions and so, under previously gathered consent, the patient pseudonymised personal data may be sent tocountries outside the EEA that areprovided with the same level of protection for privacy. 
Medical data sent outside this area in the context of EBMT research projects will be identified by the non-informative database number, and items such as date of birth, initials or the hospital UPN will not be exported. 
EBMT will not sell, distribute or lease personal data to third parties unless the data subject has provided EBMT with his or her consent or it is allowed by law.
What the Rights of the Data Subjects?
The Data Subject has the right to the following information about its personal data being processed:
Confirmation as to whether data related to him or her are being processed;
Information about the purposes of the processing operations, the categories of data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data are disclosed;
Communication of the data undergoing processing. 
The Data Subject shall have the rights listed below:
Access to information on his or her processed personal data;
Rectification of any inaccurate or incomplete personal data; 
Withdraw consent and the personal data will no longer be made available for future research;
Request that his or her personal data be completely erased from the EBMT Registry database and from databases to which the data has been exported;
Any other right granted to the Data Subject with regard to his personal data, under his or her respective local legislation.
If as a Data Subject you wish to exercise any of the rights listed above. Please send an email to or use the postal address below.
