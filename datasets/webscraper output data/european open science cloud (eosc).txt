The ambition of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) is to provide European researchers, innovators, companies and citizens with a federated and open multi-disciplinary environment where they can publish, find and reuse data, tools and services for research, innovation and educational purposes.
EOSC ultimately aims to develop a Web of FAIR Data and services for science in Europe upon which a wide range of value-added services can be built. These range from visualisation and analytics to long-term information preservation or the monitoring of the uptake of open science practices.

The system resulting from the activities and initiatives promoted by the European Commission to support its policies on Open Science and Open Innovation 2.0.

It is a trusted system providing seamless access to data and interoperable services. It supports the whole research data cycle, from discovery and mining to storage, management, analysis and re-use across borders and disciplines.
It consists of a set of interacting components: actors, services, data, policies, and infrastructures.
It is implemented by adopting a federated, decentralised, distributed and participatory approach.
The system performs functions and carries out purposes that do not reside in any component alone (aka emergent behaviour).
