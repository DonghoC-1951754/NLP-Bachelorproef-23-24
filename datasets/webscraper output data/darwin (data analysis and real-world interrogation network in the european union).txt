Data partners enable DARWIN EU to use their data in its scientific studies by executing analytic packages, and provide analysis results to the DARWIN EU Coordination Centre, in accordance with data protection andgovernancerules. For more information see theData Networkpage.Coordination CentreTheDARWIN EU Coordination Centre (CC)has a key function in DARWIN EU. The CC provides a structure for developing and managing the network of data partners, including their training on processes and study methods, evaluating their eligibility for performing studies, and monitoring the data quality. The CC will also be responsible for implementing and operating all the steps in thestudy execution process, from feasibility requests for studies up until the final delivery of the study report to the EMA, where results are to be integrated within the EU regulatory decision making process. In addition, the Coordination Centre will be responsible for methodological developments for DARWIN EU, as directed and instructed by EMA, and to interact with other relevant initiatives. The Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam was selected as contractor in a public tendering procedure published in June 2021 to setup the Coordination Centre for the EMA.For more information see theCoordination Centrepage.European Medicines AgencyTheEMAis responsible for providing leadership and direction, setting standards for DARWIN EU, contracting, instructing and overseeing the Coordination Centre and monitoring its performance. For questions raised by the EU Medicines Regulatory Network requiring additional evidence to support regulatory decision-making, the EMA will coordinate the definition of the research question and define, with the requesting body, the study objectives and possible study design options such as the study population, exposures, outcomes and statistical measures. This information will be communicated to the Cordination Centre for a further feasibility assessment. Based on the feasibility assessment, the EMA, in consultation with the Cordination Centre, will decide on the relevance of conducting a study, specify eligibility criteria for the databases to be included, identify relevant databases and define the evidentiary standards to be applied in the studies (e.g., data quality). The EMA will process the results of the analyses and the report of specific studies, feeding results into decision-making, as appropriate. To support the establishment of the DARWIN EU, aDARWIN EUAdvisory Boardhas been set up by EMA.EU Medicines Regulatory NetworkThe EU Medicines Regulatory Network includes the EMA (encompassing its scientific committees and working parties), national competent authorities (NCAs) of Member States in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Commission. During the operation of DARWIN EU, the need for additional real-world evidence identified within the EU Medicines Regulatory Network to support regulatory activities will be submitted to and further discussed with EMA.Other OrganisationsInteractions between EMA and other organisations, institutions and projects can take place to improve the infrastructure, methodological standards and operational processes of the DARWIN EU network. These interactions could take place with, for example:theEuropean Health Data Space(EHDS), of which DARWIN EU will be a key user and will need to be fully integrated and use the services provided by the EHDS;ongoing EU and national projects in scope of DARWIN EU and relevant to the quality, transformation, maintenance or analysis of real-world datasets, including European networking initiatives such as theEuropean Health Data Evidence Network(EHDEN) project, European platforms for registries or the European Reference Networks (ERNs), which has established registry platforms for rare diseases;theEuropean Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance(ENCePP) network, for integration and continuously updating of good methodological practice in pharmacoepidemiology, identification of data sources and registration of studies;regulatory authorities in third countries, to learn from their experience and to integrate learnings such as governance and methodological aspects.Last Updated: 26 March 2023DisclaimerThe content on the website is the responsibility of the DARWIN EU Coordination Centre and cannot be interpreted as reflecting the views of the European Medicines Agency or the European Medicines Regulatory Network.Coordination CentreWho is Involved?Principles & PoliciesData NetworkMethodsStudiesWebinarsEmailFAQLegal NoticeData Protection NoticeCookie Policy

This project is led by the French Health Data Hub (HDH)a French organisation that aims to ensure easy, unified, transparent and secure access to health data to improve quality of care and support for patients.Multiple consortiumsare involved in the EHDS pilot, from EU agencies (EMA included), national platforms and international research infrastructures. The consortium will aim to answer the European Commissions call for project to concretely test the EHDS in practice by creating a network of data platforms at European level, by conducting cross-border research use cases, and provide recommendation for the future EHDS.The pilot project will create the first European network for secondary use of data projects, containing a metadata search portal, data access request portal and other central services. Within the network, project leaders will be able to querymetadata catalogues of all nodes and ask for data access in several nodes with a single data application form.EMA will be an authorised participant and consortium partner within the EHDS2 pilot project. EMAsuse case on thrombosis(see below) will aim to leverage DARWIN EU, among other platforms. DARWIN EU and the EHDS2 pilot are two complementary and synergetic projects for the secondary use of health data.EMA Use CaseEMAs use case will aim to investigate the natural history of coagulopathy and use of antithrombotic agents in COVID-19 patients and persons vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The study has previously been conducted via the EMA Framework Contract and the results of this study may be used for benchmarking (EUPAS40414). This is an important use case that will test the wayDARWIN EU will be integrated in EHDS in the future. Six specific objectives of the study were presented, increasing in levelof complexity, which will be chosen by data partners while considering their capability and the data they hold.It will be important to evaluate how the data from the different nodes will be combined, considering data available in the Common Data Model (CDM) via DARWIN EU and data available in other nodes in native format. It was also clarified that the CDM is not a pre-requisite for becoming a node in the EHDS pilot. In the future, some data sources, such as some registriesfor example will not be converted into a CDM. The objective will be to see how the different data sources can be combined in a single study in a meaningful way.For more information:European Commission: European Health Data SpacePress Release EHDS2 Pilot ProjectLast Updated: 27 March 2023DisclaimerThe content on the website is the responsibility of the DARWIN EU Coordination Centre and cannot be interpreted as reflecting the views of the European Medicines Agency or the European Medicines Regulatory Network.Coordination CentreWho is Involved?Principles & PoliciesData NetworkMethodsStudiesWebinarsEmailFAQLegal NoticeData Protection NoticeCookie Policy
