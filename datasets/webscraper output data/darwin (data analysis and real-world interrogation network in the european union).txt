DARWIN EU supports regulatory decision-making by:

establishing and expanding a catalogue of observational data sources for use in medicines regulation;
providing a source of high-quality, validated real world data on the uses, safety and  of medicines;
addressing specific questions by carrying out high-quality, non-interventional studies, including developing scientific protocols, interrogating relevant data sources and interpreting and reporting study results.

The range of approved healthcare databases enabling distributed data access via DARWIN EU will evolve and expand over time.

Who is involved?

DARWIN EU has multiple actors: ,  , , and .
Data Partners
DARWIN EU collaborates with data partners who help generate real-world evidence that can be used in scientific evaluations and regulatory decision-making. Data partners are partners who have access to raw data in-house or remotely, through ownership, public contract, third-party agreement or commercial license. Data partners enable DARWIN EU to use their data in its scientific studies by executing analytic packages, and provide analysis results to the DARWIN EU Coordination Centre, in accordance with data protection and governancerules. For more information see the  page.
Coordination Centre
The has a key function in DARWIN EU. The CC provides a structure for developing and managing the network of data partners, including their training on processes and study methods, evaluating their eligibility for performing studies, and monitoring the data quality. The CC will also be responsible for implementing and operating all the steps in the , from feasibility requests for studies up until the final delivery of the study report to the EMA, where results are to be integrated within the EU regulatory decision making process. In addition, the Coordination Centre will be responsible for methodological developments for DARWIN EU, as directed and instructed by EMA, and to interact with other relevant initiatives. The Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam was selected as contractor in a public tendering procedure published in June 2021 to setup the Coordination Centre for the EMA. For more information see the  page.
European Medicines Agency
The  is responsible for providing leadership and direction, setting standards for DARWIN EU, contracting, instructing and overseeing the Coordination Centre and monitoring its performance. For questions raised by the EU Medicines Regulatory Network requiring additional evidence to support regulatory decision-making, the EMA will coordinate the definition of the research question and define, with the requesting body, the study objectives and possible study design options such as the study population, exposures, outcomes and statistical measures. This information will be communicated to the Cordination Centre for a further feasibility assessment. Based on the feasibility assessment, the EMA, in consultation with the Cordination Centre, will decide on the relevance of conducting a study, specify eligibility criteria for the databases to be included, identify relevant databases and define the evidentiary standards to be applied in the studies (e.g., data quality). The EMA will process the results of the analyses and the report of specific studies, feeding results into decision-making, as appropriate. To support the establishment of the DARWIN EU, a  has been set up by EMA.
EU Medicines Regulatory Network
The EU Medicines Regulatory Network includes the EMA (encompassing its scientific committees and working parties), national competent authorities (NCAs) of Member States in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Commission. During the operation of DARWIN EU, the need for additional real-world evidence identified within the EU Medicines Regulatory Network to support regulatory activities will be submitted to and further discussed with EMA.
Other Organisations
Interactions between EMA and other organisations, institutions and projects can take place to improve the infrastructure, methodological standards and operational processes of the DARWIN EU network. These interactions could take place with, for example:

the  (EHDS), of which DARWIN EU will be a key user and will need to be fully integrated and use the services provided by the EHDS;
ongoing EU and national projects in scope of DARWIN EU and relevant to the quality, transformation, maintenance or analysis of real-world datasets, including European networking initiatives such as the (EHDEN) project, European platforms for registries or the European Reference Networks (ERNs), which has established registry platforms for rare diseases;
the  (ENCePP) network, for integration and continuously updating of good methodological practice in pharmacoepidemiology, identification of data sources and registration of studies;
regulatory authorities in third countries, to learn from their experience and to integrate learnings such as governance and methodological aspects.

Coordination Centre




EMA is working with Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam to:

establish theDARWIN EUCoordination Centre, and support its work to build a distributed data network;
conduct scientific studies and answer research questions supporting regulatory decision-making by EMA's scientific committees and the ;
maintain a catalogue of real world data sources for use in the regulatory context and their metadata.

The DARWIN EU Coordination Centre will be a key user of the future .
The contract to establish the Coordination Centre was awarded to Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam following a call for tender for a service provider published in June 2021.
The  group at the Department of Medical Informatics is leading the Establishment and Operational Phase of the DARWIN EU Coordination Centre.
Organisational Structure

The DARWIN EU CC exists to run studies within its data partner network, overseen by the Study and Network Operations pillars, respectively. These pillars are able to execute studies and onboard Data Partners using tools (such as code and protocols) that have been created by the Development pillar and within an infrastructure that has been created by the Technology pillar. The Technology pillar is also responsible for producing necessary project resources, such as the website and service desk. The overall operation of DARWIN EU is overseen by the Management pillar and with guidance from the Advisory Boards.

Data Protection
The DARWIN EU Coordination Center (CC) executes studies in its distributed data network using a federated approach in which analytical code is shared with the data partners and only aggregated study results are shared with the CC. In this privacy-by-design approach additional measures can be added, for example a minimum cell count, to comply to local governance rules. With each data partner an  is setup that includes information about this procedure. More information about study execution can be found .
The latest version of the Record of Processing Activities (ROPA) can be found under below. For more information also see the .

Conflict of Interest
The studies and analyses conducted in DARWIN EU shall be conducted in accordance with the principle of scientific independence, as set out under the 
According to ENCePP, scientific independence means that:

the primary purpose of the study shall be to generate evidence of potential scientific or public health importance and not to promote the use of a medicinal product or any specific outcome;
the design of the research shall aim at minimising any potential bias;
any financial, commercial, institutional, or personal interest in a particular outcome of the study (i.e., in the results and their interpretation) at the level of the organisation(s) initiating or funding the study and of the coordinating study entity and/or the researcher(s) conducting the study, shall not influence any decision on the scientific aspects of the study in any direction, including data collection and analysis, interpretation and dissemination of the study results.

Where relevant, the definitions and principles set out under  shall also be applied.

European Health Data Space

DARWIN EU will connect the  to the European Commission's , an initiative to promote better exchange and access to different types of health data.
While the needs and use cases of medicine regulators and decision-makers will drive DARWIN EU's development, DARWIN EU also contributes to developing the EHDS and the joint action to deliver European principles for the secondary use of health data, known as .
Acting as an early flagship 'pathfinder' for the EHDS, DARWIN EU will enable the exchange of healthcare data for use in healthcare delivery, policy-making and research across Europe, while fully complying with data protection requirements.
EHDS HealthData@EU Pilot
Recently, the EHDS2 Pilot Project was initiated which will run till September 2024. This project is led by the French Health Data Hub (HDH)a French organisation that aims to ensure easy, unified, transparent and secure access to health data to improve quality of care and support for patients.
Multiple consortiums are involved in the EHDS pilot, from EU agencies (EMA included), national platforms and international research infrastructures. The consortium will aim to answer the European Commissions call for project to concretely test the EHDS in practice by creating a network of data platforms at European level, by conducting cross-border research use cases, and provide recommendation for the future EHDS.
The pilot project will create the first European network for secondary use of data projects, containing a metadata search portal, data access request portal and other central services. Within the network, project leaders will be able to querymetadata catalogues of all nodes and ask for data access in several nodes with a single data application form.
EMA will be an authorised participant and consortium partner within the EHDS2 pilot project. EMAs use case on thrombosis (see below) will aim to leverage DARWIN EU, among other platforms. DARWIN EU and the EHDS2 pilot are two complementary and synergetic projects for the secondary use of health data.
EMA Use Case
EMAs use case will aim to investigate the natural history of coagulopathy and use of antithrombotic agents in COVID-19 patients and persons vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The study has previously been conducted via the EMA Framework Contract and the results of this study may be used for benchmarking (). This is an important use case that will test the wayDARWIN EU will be integrated in EHDS in the future. Six specific objectives of the study were presented, increasing in levelof complexity, which will be chosen by data partners while considering their capability and the data they hold.
It will be important to evaluate how the data from the different nodes will be combined, considering data available in the Common Data Model (CDM) via DARWIN EU and data available in other nodes in native format. It was also clarified that the CDM is not a pre-requisite for becoming a node in the EHDS pilot. In the future, some data sources, such as some registriesfor example will not be converted into a CDM. The objective will be to see how the different data sources can be combined in a single study in a meaningful way.

Data Network




A strategic priority for DARWIN EU is to expand the scope of the network for generation of new evidence supporting the benefit-risk decision making by the EU Regulatory Network. In collaboration with EMA and the Scientific Panel, the Coordination Centre shall seek to identify new data partners and data sources and integrate new infrastructure and techniques into the network of data partners.
The data partners enable DARWIN EU to use their data in its scientific studies, and provide analysis results to the DARWIN EU Coordination Centre, in accordance with data protection rules. They can be part of the data network directly or through a Data Permit Authority, as shown in the figure below.

DARWIN EU is expected to bring on board a minimum of ten data sources every year.
The following requirements are defined for candidate data sources:

Data sources collecting health data routinely and representative of the different types of real-world data in terms of data elements, setting (primary & secondary care), population and origin (e.g. electronic health care records, claims)
Data sources which collectively provide a broad geographical coverage
Data sources containing patient-level data with a unique patient identifier linking all records relating to a given patient
Medicines prescribed or dispensed identifiable with quantities (e.g. doses, package size) and dates allowing to calculate cumulative doses and duration of use and linked to individual but unidentifiable patients
Clinical events formally coded, with accurate dates and linked to individual but unidentifiable patients
Data already converted or planned to be converted into a common data model

 with access toreal-world healthcare data from sources such ashospitals, primary care, health insurance, registriesandbiobanks.
Data Sources were selected after consultation with the DARWIN EU Advisory Board andfollowing the prioritisation criteria below:

Continuous data collection (at least annual data updates)
A lag time of less than six months in data availability for analysis and capture of health outcomes and medicines prescribing or dispensing
Data converted into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model

Why join the data network?




The role of a DARWIN EU Data Partner



DPs that are part of the DARWIN EU network will maintain a relationship with the CC, realised in two different ways:

DPs will be active study participants and co-author results.
DPs who are onboarded will be eligible to participate in studies undertaken in DARWIN EU. This means that, after a feasibility assessment has been completed, they may be invited to studies and, if agreeing to participate, run centrally-developed code to return aggregated results to the CC for integration and reporting. However, DPs are more than data providers who are just running common analytics and returning results: they are the experts in their database and can contribute to all aspects of the study including design, quality control, and dissemination of results. We therefore believe that suitably experienced DPs should be able to opt-in for multiple roles in a study, including scientific and epidemiological expertise and report/publication development. This is also important for the necessary capacity building, so DARWIN EU can scale up to facilitate the completion of studies in parallel in its operational phase. It is expected that participating DPs will co-author publications resulting from the corresponding studies.

DPs will receive DARWIN EU training.
We will provide periodic training and workshops, in part offered via remote learning environments, so that DPs are aware of the latest best practice in data use and management, study development and methods and tools. Onboarded DPs will be expected to actively participate in a thriving DARWIN EU community, which will allow exchange of experiences and opportunities for continuing improvement and growth.


What are the benefits for DARWIN EU DPs?

Working for the benefit of the EMA and EMRN with the generation of real-world evidence critical for medicines regulation at the European level, for example on diseases, patient populations, and the use, safety and effectiveness of medicines, including vaccines, throughout the lifecycle of a medicinal product.
Supporting decision-making on the use, safety and effectiveness of medicines, from which a wide range of stakeholders will benefit, from patients and healthcare professionals through to health technology assessment bodies and the pharmaceutical industry.
Participation in high-impact publications derived from studies undertaken in DARWIN EU.
Assurance of scientific independence, freedom to decline studies, respect for each institutions own approval procedures.
Facilitated scientific collaboration, connections with peers and learnings by becoming part of a thriving academic/medical/regulatory network and community.
Increased external visibility for the DPs data, expanding opportunities to participate in other studies, joint research projects and grant proposals beyond DARWIN EU, helping the long-term sustainability of the DP. Boosted opportunities to participate in other international studies for larger regulatory impact, which will provide an invaluable resource to prepare for and respond to future healthcare crises and pandemics.
Improved interoperability and understanding of own data, enhancing data partners internal decision-making processes, with potential to propagate learnings inside institutions to enhance procedures and generally improve the underlying healthcare systems. Added possibilities for auditing/refining/visualising own data through open source tooling  understanding own data sets better, including integrative analyses, revealing the potential flaws for continued improvement.
Increased transparency of analyses and reproducibility, enabling studies to be easily transposed to other data sources for multiplied impact (e.g., in publications).
Increased speed of performing studies, improved performance, accelerated research (months/years to weeks): allowing DPs to undertake more studies in less time, with less resources.
Access to a training platform on data standardisation, quality control, and analytics by the Coordination Centre.
Exposure to and collaborative experience with world-class experts in real-world evidence generation using the OMOP CDM.

How to join the data network?

The Open Call for DPs described in this document welcomes expressions of interest from any data custodian in Europe wishing to be considered as a candidate DP for DARWIN EU. These include primary and secondary care data sources, claims databases, biobanks, etc. Being open to any data source, the Open Call is an instrument to facilitate a level playing field to any interested institution to participate in DARWIN EU and aims to compile relevant information from candidate Data Partners to support decision making by the EMA to determine which DPs will be formally invited to join the initiative.
How to express interest? 
The process is simple. DPs interested need to provide information on their data source(s) through an Expression of Interest (EoI) form. At the moment, this form is an Excel spreadsheet, which is accessible here:

  

Potential DPs should download the form and complete it offline. Once the form is duly completed, it must be sent by an authorised representative (i.e. person in the institution with authority to submit such applications) to the following email address:
This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.
What happens after submission of the Expression of Interest?
Upon receipt, the CC will acknowledge receipt by email reply to the sender. Each Expression of Interest correctly received will be checked by the CC for completeness, consistency and scope. Expressions of Interest that are deemed to be incomplete, inconsistent, or out of scope will be rejected at that stage, and the candidate informed correspondingly within two weeks from the receipt date. Rejected submissions due to lack of completeness or consistency can be re-submitted after correcting the EoI.
All other EoIs will become part of a list of interested potential DPs. This list will be reviewed by the CC and the EMA at least twice a year, corresponding to EoIs received on or before the following dates every year:
30th April
31st October
Although these are deemed to be the ordinary cut-off dates, the CC and the EMA reserve the right of reviewing applications at any point in time, depending on the needs of the network and forthcoming studies.Following a request from the EMA, the CC may announce the termination of this Open Call for DPs.
The review process will examine all Expressions of Interest and consider factors such as type of data, size, geographical representativeness, added value to the network, perceived data quality, governance procedures, coverage of specific populations, past experience in studies, potential intention to convert data to or status of the mapping to the OMOP CDM, etc., and will result in a short list of DPs to be approached. Final decision on the short list rests with the EMA considering the current and future needs for studies.
Shortlisted DPs may then be approached by the CC to discuss outstanding questions with CC/EMA experts, or be directly invited to initiate the formal onboarding process, which consist of several steps and finishes with the signature of an agreement with the CC (see ), which signals the official participation in DARWIN EU as a Data Partner. 
It is important to note that no guarantees are given to any candidate DP as regards their selection or effective incorporation into DARWIN EU until the onboarding process is successfully completed and the agreement with the CC has been signed. Conversely, submission of an EoI is non-binding for candidate DPs, and they may withdraw from the selection process if no longer interested.
All received EoIs will remain in the list of interested potential DPs (unless the applicant expresses a wish to be removed through the email address mentioned above) and can be shortlisted in any review round.
Additionally, the Expression of Interest form allows DPs to explicitly agree that the information they submit is automatically included in the public EMA Metadata Catalogue of data sources, increasing their discoverability to researchers for the conduct of other scientific studies.

FAQ Open Calls










No. To be considered as a candidate DP, the first step is to submit an Expression of Interest.

 













Yes, unless duly justified, in which case an appropriate justification should be included.

 













The information contained in the EoI will primarily be used for the purposes of evaluating candidacy to formally become a DARWIN EU Data Partner. You can access the associated Data Protection Notice . Additionally, by providing consent in response to a specific question in the EoI form, you as the potential DP agree that your EoI information will be used to populate the EU Metadata Catalogue, which is an EMA initiative to help improve data discoverability and transparency. The Catalogue is intended for public use, and you can read its associated Data Protection Notice 

 













No, this is a continuously open call, but please bear in mind the cut-off dates (30th April, 31st October) for review and selection.

 













No. The CC may contact you to clarify certain aspects of your datasets or EoI, or to invite you to initiate the formal onboarding process. Until the latter is successfully completed and an agreement signed, you are not a DARWIN EU DP.

 













The onboarding process consists of several quality and technical checks to ensure readiness for DARWIN EU studies, plus explanation of the terms and conditions for participation and agreement on the legal provisions that will apply to the relationship between you and the CC. Its duration can vary between 1 and 2 months, ordinarily.

 













No. The onboarding process has to be successfully completed and an agreement with the CC has to be signed.

Methods

DARWIN EU will implement the necessary paradigm shift for the delivery of reliable evidence for regulatory decision-making on the utilisation, safety and effectiveness of medicinal products throughout their lifecycle. DARWIN EU will significantly scale up in the number of studies and number of databases, while also substantially bringing down the cost of each study. This will make DARWIN EU a ground-breaking venture of Real-World Evidence generation. This ambitious endeavour cannot result from simply scaling up the traditional approaches used today.
To implement DARWIN EU, we must remove the obstacles that currently prevent the exploitation of existing data at the required speed and quality. We need to setup procedures and tools for federated study execution to be compliant to governance rules and privacy regulations. This requires that we improve the interoperability of data, develop standardised analytics, and develop tools to host all artefacts created in studies to be re-used for future studies.

Study Execution




DARWIN EU Studies are executed using a so-called federation approach as shown in the figure below. In this approach the Data Partners in the distributed data network keep full control of their own data. No patient level data is shared with the Coordination Centre (CC) only aggregated study results.




The Study Execution processes are divided into the following Phases: Exploration, Initiation, Implementation, Execution, Dissemination:












In the Exploration Phase the EMA is interacting with the Coordination Centre to explore the feasibility of a study request with respect to the preferred design, available data, resources, and timelines.

1. Study Request
Research questions originate from the EU Regulatory Network as a need for information to support the authorisation and monitoring of medicinal products and subsequent decision-making. They may include, for example, queries on the incidence or prevalence of disease in the European population, the drug utilisation patterns for a specific product, the collection of additional data on a potential safety signal, the evaluation of an association between a drug and a clinical outcome or the assessment of the effectiveness of a risk minimisation measure. It is envisaged that in the future, research questions may also originate from other stakeholders such as the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies and payers.
The requester, together with EMA, prepares the Feasibility Assessment Form containing: a short title for the request, the regulatory background motivating the query, any other important information for understanding the query, the product and/or event(s)/outcome(s) of interest, the objective, a proposal for the study design and any relevant design considerations such as the choice of data sources and other methodological aspects. The choice of study design is supported by the  providing, for a range of possible analyses with different levels of complexity (Routine repeated, Off-the-shelf, Complex), the implications in terms of databases needed and timelines.
2. Feasibility Assessment
The Coordination Centre then performs a feasibility assessment for EMA review. Its aim is to assess the feasibility of the study based on relevant factors for the concerned study, including, for example, the number of exposed patients, number of events, time period, minimum duration of exposure to be considered, time lag for occurrence of event, feasibility of implementing the study design in the available databases or other criteria depending on the study. The feasibility assessment will in principle only use information already available to CC on the characteristics of databases via pre-calculated Data Dashboards and other relevant information.
If necessary, simple data analyses could be performed in relevant databases available, for example simple count of the number of patients exposed to a medicinal product or who experienced a clinical event over a defined time period. Such data analysis may be performed in a limited number of databases by the Coordination Centre and will not undergo the same quality assurance process as those performed for a full study.
The results of the feasibility analysis are next included in the Feasibility Assessment Form with a recommendation regarding the conduct of the study. The decision to initiate the study is formally made by the EMA.

 













In the Initiation Phase the contractual agreements are setup with the selected Data Partners, the Study Team is formed, and the Conflicts of Interest procedure is applied.

Contractual Agreements
Upon green light to conduct a study, the Coordination Centre is responsible for the contractual agreement and onboarding of Data Partners in the study. A standardised work order is initiated by the DARWIN EU CC which indicates the agreed timelines and the budget of the study. Each data partner will sign a standard work order agreement which specifies their activities, budget, and timelines.
Team Formation
The level of involvement of a study team will strongly depend on the Study Type, i.e., simple off the shelf studies may be run near automatically with a fast review step by a small team. For more complex studies a larger team may be proposed by Study Operations. This team consist of data scientists, epidemiologists, and clinical domain experts who are responsible for Evidence Generation and Evidence Synthesis. The team is completed with Data Stewards from the participating Data Partners who will work in a secured collaboration space.
Documentation and assessment of Conflicts of Interest
Potential investigators to be assigned to a DARWIN EU study shall be requested to declare any existing direct or indirect interests in a pharmaceutical company. These terms are further defined in the . More details on The DARWIN EU Conflict of Interest Procedure can be found in our section. EMA will review the submitted forms and will approve the team composition.



 













In the Implementation Phase all the study artefacts are created such as the Study Outline, Study Protocol, Cohort Definitions, Study Package.

Study Outline
Once agreement is reached between EMA and the DARWIN EU CC to conduct a DARWIN EU study, the Study Outline Form is completed describing aspects such as: Study Team, Data Sources, Choice of study type and related study design including methodological aspects, governance board approval and timelines.
The completed Study Outline Form is next submitted to the EMA for approval. Once the Study Outline Form is approved by the EMA, the protocol for the DARWIN EU studies is generated.
The Study Outline as approved and signed-off by EMA is archived at the DARWIN EU CC in a study specific project file.
Study Protocol Development
Once agreement is reached between EMA and the DARWIN EU CC on the Study Outline, the Study Protocol is generated following the  .
Upon completion of the Draft Study Protocol, this Study Protocol needs to be approved by the EMA.
Once the Study Protocol is approved and signed-off by EMA, the study protocol is archived at the DARWIN EU CC in a study specific project file.
Next, the final study protocol is uploaded to the 
Kick-off meeting
Following finalisation of the protocol and prior to study execution, a kick-off meeting is organised by the Study Project Manager/Principal Investigator with all study team members to explain the protocol, agree on roles, responsibilities and timelines for study execution.
Governance Board Approval
Protocol approval at the study sites is often required to comply with the local implementation of relevant laws and directives in the various European states. Each data custodian is responsible for protocol approval from their local governance board prior to study execution as is specified in the Framework Contract with the Data Partner.
Cohort Construction and Assessment
Where needed, a phenotype for the target and outcome cohorts that work across the included data sources is generated. This is facilitated through the , the  in addition to the . The latter provides an in-depth characterisation of the phenotype definitions, secular trends over time, standard as well as orphan source codes (not included source codes that may be of interest), and cohort participant/s characterisation.
Study Package Creation
The analysis pipeline for each study type as described within the  will be used and only needs to be instantiated with the cohorts of interest and the right parameter settings to obtain the Study Package. For example, for a study to estimate the incidence and prevalence of a health outcome the  Package is used and the parameters are set according to the protocol. Before study initiation, test runs of the analytics are performed on a subset of the data sources or on a simulated set of patients and quality control checks are performed. Once all the tests are passed, the final package is released as a private repository in the version- controlled . This package is distributed to the data partners for local execution agains their OMOP CDM.


 













In the Execution Phase the Data Partners execute the Study Package against the OMOP CDM and review the aggregated results. This includes applying quality checks on the study results and a data privacy check to assure that only aggregated data is shared compliant to their local governance procedures.

Execution Iterations
The data partners locally execute the analytics against the OMOP-CDM and review and approve the aggregated results before returning them to the Coordination Centre. Sometimes multiple execution iterations are performed, and additional fine tuning of the code base is needed. A service desk is available during the study execution for support.
Quality Control
The study results of all data sources are checked after which they are made available to the team in the Digital Research Environment and the Dissemination Phase can start. All results are locked and timestamped for reproducibility and transparency.

 













In the Dissemination Phase the evidence is synthesised in reports and result dashboards, and potentially in publications. All study artefacts are then retained

Evidence Synthesis
The results of all data sources are combined to produce the tables and figures needed for the report in the Digital Research Environment. The amount of effort for Evidence Synthesis will strongly depend on the study complexity, i.e., less effort for the off-the-shelf and routine repeated studies and more effort for the complex studies. The pooling of database-specific results will be pre-specified per protocol, including rules/diagnostics precluding the inclusion of a database and the use of meta-analytic approaches to combine data-specific estimates. The results are reviewed, and conclusions are formed in the context of the prior knowledge if relevant.
Dashboard Instantiation
In most studies executed against the OMOP-CDM, a large amount of study results is generated from many data sources. Therefore, dashboards in the form of a web application will be made to simplify the exploration of the results. All the uploaded study results can be easily combined in a single folder from which the dashboard is instantiated. The web application will either be made publicly available or if necessary, will be made available behind a security layer.
Reporting of Study Results
The study team then writes the report and/or publication. All study reports are written in accordance with the Guideline on good pharmacovigilance (GVP) module VIII, (EMA/813938/2011) and the guidance from ENCePP. The (final) study report(s) are uploaded in the .
Study findings will preferably be considered for publication as open access. Any publication will be guided by the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ().
Retention
Before closure of the study all generated documents, used analytics, and study results are archived to enable reproducibility.

Data Interoperability




Increasing productivity of reliable Real World Evidence generation requires the standardisation and automation of the analytical processes. This cannot be done without a standard representation of the data. Full interoperability of the data is needed with respect to structure (syntactic interoperability) and coding systems (semantic interoperability) by using a Common Data Model (CDM).
OMOP Common Data Model
DARWIN EU is using the  (OMOP CDM), which ismaintained by the  (OHDSI) global community. The OHDSI community also has an active   led by the Erasmus MC.
The OMOP CDM provides both syntactic and semantic interoperability. Syntacticly, the OMOP CDM is a relational database consisting of tables with demographics and clinical events ('Standardised Clinical Data', information about the care setting ('Standardised Health System'), health economics ('Standardised health economics'), records derived from other clinical tables ('Standardized derived elements') and 'Standardized metadata'). The semantic layer is provided by the 'Standardized vocabularies', which has to be populated by the OMOP standard concepts and their relationships. The standardized vocabularies are centrally maintained and distributed. The semantic interoperability is especially important in Europe with its myriad of terminology systems and languages.

Tools are available for data standardisation, data quality, and data analysis, commercially and in the public domain (see for example, ). The OMOP CDM is designed for federated querying and analytics, whereby applications are run locally at the data partners site and only aggregated results are shared. This privacy-by-design approach is compliant with data protections requirements.
The OMOP CDM is a proven model for large-scale observational health studies. It has been used in including studies that informed regulatory decision-making, and a large number of European databases are already available in OMOP CDM format. For example, the  (EHDEN) project is investing 17M private/public funding in standardising health data to the OMOP-CDM through the Innovative Medicines Initiative (). The adoption of the OMOP CDM is growing in Europe, with being formed.

Quality Control Mechanisms
As part of Data Partner (DP) onboarding, the DARWIN EU Coordination Centre (CC) assesses the quality of the data. The DARWIN EU data quality package will be aligned with the of EMA. The benefit of an interoperable data model, is dat we can use standardised tooling to extract objective data quality metrics. For this purpose we are currently using two packages:












 is an R Package to support the onboarding process of a Data Partner (DP) into the DARWIN EU Data Network. It extracts statistics from the DP's OMOP CDM instance and produces a Word document. The goal of this onboarding report is to provide insight into the completeness, transparency and quality of the performed Extraction Transform, and Load (ETL) process and the readiness of the data partner to be onboarded in the DARWIN EU data network and participate in DARWIN EU studies.
The onboarding report consists of three sections. The Clinical Data section reports on data table counts, data density, follow-up period length and date ranges. The Vocabulary Mapping section is especially important for data quality, as it shows the concept mapping coverage per domain and the top mapped/unmapped codes. Finally, the Technical Infrastructure section gives insight into the readiness of the DP to execute studies, with overviews of the query timings, installed packages and system information.
CdmOnboarding is run on-site by the DP, and extracts data directly from the OMOP CDM and from pre-calculated tables from  (OHDSI R package for OMOP CDM characterisation). The resulting Word document is required as an annex to the main Onboarding Document, to be delivered upon first onboarding. However, CdmOnboarding is required to be run on every CDM refresh, and results shared with the CC for inspection.

 













The  is an R package maintained by the OHDSI community. It performs a set of over 3000 standardised checks on a populated OMOP CDM instance. The goal is to evaluate observational data quality in a systematic and transparent way.
The quality checks are organized according to the  which uses a system of categories and contexts that represent strategies for assessing data quality. DQD contains 24 checks defined within this framework that can be systematically executed against all relevant tables and fields in the OMOP CDM.
Examples of checks executed by DQD are:

does the table/field exist, is populated and does it have the right data type (cdmField, cdmDataType, isRequired)
does the field follow the standard semantic interoperability (isStandardValidConcept)

Standardised Analytics




The DARWIN EU Coordination Centre (CC) has been set up to maximise the value and efficiency of real-world evidence for regulators and other stakeholders in Europe. With this in mind, it is recognised that Standardised Analytics are needed to speed up evidence generation whilst preserving the quality, reproducibility, and transparency of the proposed research.



 Standardised Analytics are enabled through the use of the OMOP Common Data Model (OMOP CDM). This has several advantages:

There is no risk for different implementations of the study design as would be the case when only a common protocol is shared that is translated to code by a programmer at each site. Differences in study outcomes are therefore related to the data instead of the study implementation.
 Standardised Analytics can be made for each Study Type that can be re-used for specific study by defining study parameters. For example, a Drug Utilisation Analytical tool can be made with parameters for the Population and Drugs of Interest.
 Standardised Analytics will produce standardised which helps EMA and its committees to streamline their assessment of the results.
 Standardised Analytics can be tested and validated following agreed Quality Assurance Processes and test data sets in the OMOP CDM format.

The CC is developing a Catalogue of Standard Data Analyses to accommodate all the requested study designs. The studies that DARWIN EU will deliver are grouped by their anticipated level of complexity: Off-the-shelf, Complex, Very Complex. The Off-The-Shelf and Complex Studies can be repeated periodically with a pre-specified regularity (e.g. yearly), called Routine Repeated Analyses.
The development of the Common Analytics is driven by the initial list of studies in the Establishment Phase of DARWIN EU. Below you can find the current version of the catalogue. There will be further discussion with stakeholders in 2023 and the catalogue will be maintained regularly.
Catalogue of Standard Data Analyses
The Catalogue of Standard Data Analyses lists the various analyses currently supported by the CC.







Off-the-shelf studies
These are mainly characterisation questions that can be executed with a generic protocol. This includes disease epidemiology, for example the estimation of the prevalence, incidence of health outcomes in defined time periods and population groups, or drug utilization studies at the population or patient level.
















Study Type/s
Patient-level characterisations are classified as off the shelf
Study Design
Cohort analysis.
Participant/s
Patient-level characterisation studies will include one or more cohort/s of people newly diagnosed with 1 or more pre-specified condition/s and with some amount of data visibility before diagnosis, and with no record of the same condition/s in the previous year (or in all previous history).
Additional eligibility criteria could apply as follows, to be incorporated as sensitivity analyses:

Additional restriction/s could apply based on socio-demographics, e.g., people aged 18 or older at the time of diagnosis
Additionally, people with a competing (differential) diagnosis could also be excluded (e.g., people with rheumatoid arthritis with a history of psoriatic arthritis could be excluded to minimise misclassification)

Follow-up
Participants will be followed up from their date of new diagnosis (index date) until the earliest of the following: loss to follow-up, end of data availability, a pre-specified time period (e.g. 1 year after index date) or death.
Analyses
Details will be discussed during programming of pipelines, but it is likely that patient-level characterisation will include:

Automated large-scale characterisation, including all recorded baseline characteristics available in the data before or on index date, based on code/s, and classified into conditions (medical history), medicine/s use, and procedure/s
Pre-specified patient-level characteristics on and/or before index date, based on pre-existing code lists or definitions (e.g., history of type 2 diabetes, or Charlson comorbidity index)
Pre-specified patient-level characteristics on and/or before index date, based on concepts and descendants where no previously validated algorithms are available
Incidence rate/s of pre-specified outcome/s within a pre-specified time period (e.g. 1 year)
Prognosis / progression to a pre-specified outcome within a pre-specified time, e.g., cumulative incidence of certain events or mortality within 1- or 5-years after diagnosis
Standard care description, including n (%) receiving each of a pre-specified list of medicine/s, device/s or procedure/s, and combinations within a pre-specified time window after diagnosis


 













Study Type/s
Patient-level DUS analyses are classified as off the shelf studies. Patient-level DUS will offer the possibility to include population-level DUS analyses as part of the same analysis.
Study Design
New drug/s user cohort
Participants
Patient-level DUS analyses will include one or more cohort/s of incident drug users with at least 1 year of data visibility, and no use of that same drug/drug class in that previous year.
Additional eligibility criteria could apply as follows:

Source population could be restricted to a specific subpopulation with certain socio-demographic or clinical feature/s, e.g., people with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis who then start to take a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD)
Additional restriction/s could apply as per product label, indication, or study aim/s, e.g., people aged 18 or older at the time of therapy initiation

Follow-up
Participants will be followed up from the date of therapy initiation (index date) until the earliest of loss to follow-up, end of data availability, or death. Patients might be censored at the time they discontinue treatment or switch to an alternative therapy.
Outcome/s
The following outcome/s will be obtained, potentially stratified by pre-specified criteria (age bands, sex, calendar year or month), and other pre-specified criteria:

New drug user cohort/s patient-level characteristics on or before index date
Indication (where available)
Initial dose/strength (as prescribed/dispensed at therapy initiation, where available)
Cumulative use within a pre-specified time period (e.g. 1 year) based on number of prescriptions and dose/strength
Treatment duration
Count of repeated prescriptions during a pre-specified time period (e.g. 1 year)

Analyses
Patient-level DUS analytics will include:

Large-scale characterisation of patient-level features based on code/concept and descendants, including socio-demographics, comorbidity, and previous medicine/s use any time in history, and in the year, and/or in the month previous to index date
Frequency and % of indication/s, based on pre-specified list of diagnoses recorded before therapy initiation (where available)
Reporting of minimum, p25, median, p75, and maximum initially prescribed or dispensed dose/strength (where available)
Reporting of minimum, p25, median, p75, and maximum cumulative use within a pre-specified time period (e.g. 1 year)
Reporting of minimum, p25, median, p75, and maximum treatment duration
Reporting of minimum, p25, median, p75, and maximum number of repeated prescriptions of the index drug during a pre-specified time period (e.g. 1 year)


 













Study Type
Population-level DUS analyses are classified as off the shelf studies.
Study Design
Population-level cohort.
Participants
Population-level analyses will include the entire source population with at least some time (typically 1 year) of data visibility available before start of study period.
Additional eligibility criteria will apply as follows:

Analyses of incidence of drug use will exclude prevalent users of the same drug/drug class on index date and/or in the previous (washout) year
The study population could be restricted to a specific subpopulation with certain socio-demographic e.g., age 18 or older, or with a history of a pre-specified clinical feature/s, e.g., people with a prior diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis
In some cases, a minimum follow-up will be requested e.g., for treatment pattern analyses


Outcome/s
The following outcome/s will be obtained, potentially stratified by pre-specified criteria (age bands, sex, calendar year or month):

Population-based incidence rates of use of a drug/drug class over calendar time. Periods could be calendar days, weeks, months, quarters or years.
Population-based prevalence of use of a drug/drug class on a given time point (point prevalence) or within a given time period (period prevalence). Periods could be calendar days, weeks, months, quarters or years.

Follow-up
Follow-up will start on a pre-specified calendar time point pre-defined as index date , e.g., 1st January or 1st of each month, and continue for a pre-specified time period, typically week, month, quarter or year.
Analyses
Population-level DUS analyses use the same analytical pipeline as Population-level descriptive epidemiology studies (see separate subsection). Incidence rates will have number of new users (with a pre-specified washout) in the numerator, and total population as person-years (except prevalent users) in the denominator. Prevalence will be calculated as number of users (prevalent or new) over whole source population at a specific time point (i.e., point prevalence) or over a specific time window (i.e., period prevalence). Both may be stratified by socio-demographics (e.g., age bands or sex) and/or calendar period. Additional criteria (e.g. disease severity/duration) may need to be considered and integrated as pre-specified in future studies.

 














Study Type/s
Population-level descriptive epidemiology are classified as off the shelf studies.
Study Design
Population-level cohort
Participant/s
Population-level analyses will include the entire source population with at least some time (typically 1 year) of data visibility available before index date.
Additional eligibility criteria will apply as follows:

Analyses of disease incidence will exclude patients with a previous/prevalent history of the same disease on index date and/or in the previous (washout) year and/or in all previous history
The source population could be restricted to a specific subpopulation with certain socio-demographic or clinical feature/s, e.g., people aged 50+ on index date

Outcome/s
The following outcome/s will be obtained, potentially stratified by pre-specified criteria (age bands, sex, calendar year or month), and other pre-specified criteria:

Population-based incidence of a disease/condition (or group of diseases/conditions) on a given time point or over time (stratified by calendar period)
Population-based prevalence of disease (or group of diseases/conditions) on a given time point (e.g., a pre-specified date), and/or over time (e.g., stratified by month or year)

Follow-up
Follow-up will start on a pre-specified calendar time point pre-defined as index date , e.g., 1st January or 1st of a given month, and continue for a pre-specified time period, typically a week, a month or a year
Analyses
Incidence rates will have number of newly diagnosed people in the numerator, and total population (satisfying the study eligibility criteria) in the denominator. Prevalence will be calculated as number of people with the diagnosis (prevalent or new) over whole source population on a specific date (point prevalence) or over a window of time (period prevalence). Both can be stratified by socio-demographics (e.g., age bands or sex) and/or calendar period. Other criteria (e.g. disease severity/duration) may need to be considered and integrated in future studies.

 
















Complex
These are studies requiring development or customisation of specific study designs, protocols, analytics, phenotypes. This includes studies on the safety and effectiveness of medicines and vaccines.
















Motivation
Although new user cohorts are preferred, prevalent user designs can be desirable in some instances, particularly when a recently marketed medicine is to be compared to an existing and heavily used active comparator, as many of the new users of the recently launched will be previous users of the existing active comparator medicine. This leads to a situation where new users of a new medicine with no use of the active comparator are scarce, and potentially non representative of the desired target population of all users of the new drug. Prevalent user cohort studies have been used in recent years to study the potential effects of medicines like ACE inhibitors or alpha-1-blockers against SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 severity [; ].
Study Type/s
Prevalent user active comparator cohort studies are classified as complex analyses.
Study Design
Prevalent user cohorts.
Participant/s
At least two cohorts, including a cohort of prevalent users of at least one drug/medicinal product under investigation (target cohort) and a cohort of prevalent users of at least one drug/medicinal product as an active comparator (comparator cohort). Typically, prevalent user cohorts will be defined by the previous use of a target/comparator medicine during a specific time period or for a pre-specified duration.
Follow-up
Participants in each cohort will be followed from a specific index date different from the date of treatment initiation. Based on previous examples, this will typically be a calendar date, e.g. 1st of March 2022.
Two possibilities of analyses will be offered:

In a fixed follow-up analysis, follow-up will continue until death, loss of follow-up or a pre-specified time period (e.g., 3 years) regardless of treatment duration
In an on treatment analysis, follow-up will continue until treatment cessation, death, or loss of follow-up

Outcome/s
One or more study outcomes will be pre-specified, based on previous DARWIN EU algorithms or newly developed and validated ones.
In addition, a long list of negative control outcomes will be assessed, which are not known to have a causal association with the drug/s or medicinal product/s under study.
Analyses
Details will be discussed during programming of pipelines, but new users cohort analyses will include:

Large-scale characterisation of participants in the target and comparator cohorts, including all features available in the data before or on index date.
Large-scale propensity scores (LSPS) will be estimated as the probability of exposure (target cohort) conditional on all available covariates available in the data with a prevalence >1%. LSPS will be estimated using Lasso regression. Different to new user cohorts, LSPS will be estimated using the information available on the index date, which in the case of prevalent users is not the date of therapy initiation but a different previously specified date.
Incidence rate/s of each of the outcomes of interest in the target and comparator cohorts after LSPS matching, stratification, or inverse probability weighting
Diagnostic/s:

Covariate balance: a plot will be produced depicting the standardized mean difference/s between target and comparator cohorts for all available covariates before (x axis) and after propensity score matching/stratification/weighting (y axis) [see Figure 4 for an illustrative example]
Equipoise: plots of the distribution of the propensity score stratified by target vs comparator cohort [see Figure 4 for an illustrative example]
Analyses will not be conducted where there is insufficient data, based on a pre-specified minimum detectable rate ratio (e.g., MDRR>5)
Optional: In addition to the two above, residual confounding/systematic error will be available for estimation, as based on the number of negative control outcome/s significantly associated with the exposure of interest


Rate Ratios or Hazard Ratio/s and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using Poisson or Cox models respectively, comparing the target vs comparator (reference) cohorts after LSPS matching, stratification, or inverse probability weighting
Optionally, calibrated RR or HR will be estimated after empirical calibration using negative control outcomes


 













Study Type/s
New user active comparator cohort studies are classified as complex analyses.
Study Design
New user cohorts.
Participant/s
At least two cohorts, including a cohort of new users of at least one drug/medicinal product under investigation (target cohort) and a cohort of new users of at least one drug/medicinal product as an active comparator (comparator cohort). Typically, new user cohorts exclude previous users of either cohort in the previous year as well as people with <1 year of data visibility before inclusion.
Follow-up
Participants in each cohort will be followed from therapy initiation date (index date). Two possibilities of analyses will be offered:

In a fixed follow-up analysis, follow-up will continue until death, loss to follow-up or a pre-specified time period (e.g., 3 years) regardless of treatment duration
In an on treatment analysis, follow-up will continue until treatment cessation, death, or loss of follow-up

Outcome/s
One or more study outcomes will be pre-specified, based on previous DARWIN EU algorithms or newly developed and validated ones.
In addition, a long list of negative control outcomes will be assessed, which are not known to have a causal association with the drug/s or medicinal product/s under study.
Analyses
Details will be discussed during programming of pipelines, but new users cohort analyses will include:

Large-scale characterisation of participants in the target and comparator cohorts, including all features available in the data before or on index date
Large-scale propensity scores (LSPS) will be estimated as the probability of exposure (target cohort) conditional on all available covariates available in the data with a prevalence >1%. LSPS will be estimated using Lasso regression
Incidence rate/s of each of the outcomes of interest in the target and comparator cohorts after LSPS matching, stratification, or inverse probability weighting
Diagnostic/s:

Covariate balance
Equipoise: plots of the distribution of the propensity score stratified by target vs comparator cohort
Analyses will not be conducted where there is insufficient data, based on a pre-specified minimum detectable rate ratio (e.g., MDRR>5)
Optional: In addition to the two above, residual confounding/systematic error will be available for estimation, as based on the number of negative control outcomes significantly associated with the exposure of interest


Rate Ratios or Hazard Ratio/s and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using Poisson or Cox models respectively, comparing the target vs comparator (reference) cohorts after LSPS matching, stratification, or inverse probability weighting
Optionally, calibrated RR or HR will be estimated after empirical calibration using negative control outcomes


 













Study Type/s
Self-controlled case risk interval studies are classified as complex analyses.
Study Design
Self-controlled case risk interval (SCRI).
Participant/s
Just like SCCS, SCRI studies include one or more cohort/s of people who suffer a specified safety event/group of event/s at least once in their record/s. Additional eligibility criteria could apply based on socio-demographics or clinical characteristics.
Follow-up
The SCRI design uses a pre-specified control interval relative to the exposure (typically vaccination) date as the control time. These control intervals can be before or after exposure, but must be defined a priori. We will therefore pre-define study-specific follow-up pre- and/or post-exposure control interval periods, and participants will be followed/observed for the pre-specified control interval, and immediately after/during exposure to a medicinal product. Similar to SCCS, the specified control interval (either pre- and/or post-exposure) periods will be considered as baseline or unexposed, whilst treatment episode/s are exposed.
Outcome/s
One or more study outcomes will be pre-specified, based on previous DARWIN EU algorithms or newly developed and validated ones. Ideally, outcomes should be acute in presentation and with a clear and accurate diagnosis date.
In addition, a long list of negative control outcomes will be assessed, which are not known to have a causal association with the drug/s or medicinal product/s under study.
Analyses
Details will be discussed during programming of pipelines, but SCRI will include:

Large-scale characterisation of SCRI participants at the time of diagnosis, including all recorded features available in the data before or on index date, based on SNOMED code/s
Pre-specified patient-level characteristics on and/or before diagnosis, based on pre-existing cohorts or definitions (e.g., history of type 2 diabetes, or Charlson comorbidity index).
Pre-specified patient-level characteristics on and/or before diagnosis, based on concepts and descendants where no previously validated algorithms are available
Incidence rate/s during pre-specified control interval and exposed time
Diagnostic/s:

Event-exposure independence: a histogram of the time between the event date and the end of observation for individuals censored and uncensored will be plotted to assess for potentially event-dependent observation time
Analyses will not be conducted where there is insufficient data, based on a pre-specified minimum detectable rate ratio (e.g., MDRR>5)
Optional: In addition to the two above, residual confounding/systematic error will be available for estimation, as based on the number of negative control outcomes significantly associated with the exposure of interest


Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using conditional Poisson regression models, comparing the exposed vs the control interval period.
Adjusted incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated after adjustment for age and seasonality
Optionally, calibrated incidence rate ratios will be estimated after empirical calibration of the adjusted incidence rate ratio based on the observed systematic error


 













Study Type/s
Self-controlled case series are classified as complex (C3) analyses.
Study Design
Self-controlled case series (SCCS).
Participant/s
SCCS will include one or more cohort/s of people who suffer a specified safety event/group of events at least once in their record/s, hence their denomination as case series. Additional eligibility criteria could apply based on socio-demographics or clinical characteristics.
Follow-up
We will pre-define follow-up periods according to exposure history. Typically, participants in an SCCS will be followed for some time before (pre-exposure), during (exposed) and post-exposure to a medicinal product. Sometimes, a washout is imposed before the beginning of the exposure period. Pre- and post-exposure periods will be considered as baseline or unexposed, whilst treatment episode/s are exposed. The washout period will be disregarded and not accounted for in the analyses. See Figure 3 for an illustration.
In some analyses, only the first event will be considered for each participant to minimise biases, with follow-up censored after that first event.
Outcome/s
One or more study outcomes will be pre-specified, based on previous DARWIN EU algorithms or newly developed and validated ones. Ideally, outcomes should be acute in presentation and with a clear and accurate diagnosis date.
In addition, a long list of negative control outcomes will be assessed, which are known to have no causal association with the drug/s or medicinal product/s under study.
Analyses
Details will be discussed during programming of pipelines, but SCCS will include:

Large-scale characterisation of SCCS participants at the time of diagnosis (index date), including all recorded features available in the data before or at that date, based on SNOMED code/s
Pre-specified patient-level characteristics on before or at index date, based on pre-existing cohorts or definitions (e.g., history of type 2 diabetes, or Charlson comorbidity index).
Pre-specified patient-level characteristics on before or at index date, based on concepts and descendants where no previously validated algorithms are available
Incidence rates during exposed and unexposed time
Diagnostic/s:

Event-exposure independence: a histogram of the time between the event date and the end of observation for individuals censored and uncensored will be plotted to assess potential for event-dependent observation time
Analyses will not be conducted where there is insufficient data, based on a pre-specified minimum detectable rate ratio (e.g., MDRR>5)
Optional: In addition to the two above, residual confounding/systematic error will be available for estimation, as based on the distribution of results from the negative control outcome analyses


Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using conditional Poisson regression models, comparing the exposed vs the baseline period.
Adjusted incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated after adjustment for age and seasonality
Optionally, calibrated incidence rate ratios will be estimated after empirical calibration of the adjusted incidence rate ratio based on the observed systematic error


 













Study Type
These are considered complex epidemiological studies as they require bespoke modelling of interventions like public health restrictions after the calculation of population- and/or patient-level disease epidemiology estimates. These analyses will take the form of interrupted time series to analyse the impact of an intervention (e.g., a public health restriction or change/s in law) on the occurrence of an outcome at the population-level (e.g., incidence of COVID-19 before vs after imposition of public health restrictions) and/or at the patient level (e.g., characteristics of people newly diagnosed before vs after change/s in law).
Study Design
Population-level cohort/s AND Patient-level characterisation.
Participant/s
Population-level analyses will include the entire source population with at least 1 year of data visibility available before start of study period. Additional eligibility criteria could apply as in population-level disease epidemiology (see above). Stratification will be used in the case of Difference-in-difference studies to obtain a control (unimpacted) counterfactual for comparison.
Patient-level analyses will be restricted to newly diagnosed subjects, using a 1-year washout, and with potential additional eligibility (see above).
Exposure/s
At least one public health measure, regulatory action (e.g., banning or change in use of a medicinal product) or other intervention will have been imposed at a known date in time. In the case of Difference-in-difference analyses, these should only affect a known subpopulation, with another subpopulation not affected by the intervention acting as the unimpacted counterfactual.
The study period will be pre-specified, and divided into pre-exposure (i.e., unimpacted time) and post-exposure (i.e., impacted) calendar time.
In Difference-in-difference studies, the observed pre- vs post-exposure changes in the Exposed will be compared to those in the Unexposed subpopulation.
A lag period between the intervention and the start of the post-exposure study period could be considered to allow for the action to have an impact on the study outcome/s.
Outcome/s
The following will be estimated for a pre-specified study period, including at least 1 year before and after the intervention/s of interest:

Population-based incidence rates of a condition/group of condition/s over time
Population-based prevalence of a condition/group of conditions over time
For Difference-in-differences: population-based incidence and prevalence of a condition/group of condition/s over time, and in the exposed vs unexposed populations separately

At the patient level, two cohorts of newly diagnosed people will be studied, namely those diagnosed in the period before (unimpacted) vs after the intervention (impacted). The following outcome/s will be obtained and compared for both cohorts:

Patient-level characteristics amongst the newly diagnosed before vs after intervention
(Optional) Patient-level characteristics amongst the prevalent cases on a given date/s before vs after intervention
Prognosis / progression to a pre-specified outcome within a pre-specified time for those diagnosed before vs after the exposure of interest
Standard care description, including n (%) receiving each of a pre-specified list of medicine/s, common combinations among those diagnosed before vs after the exposure of interest
(Optional) Standard care description, including n (%) receiving each of a pre-specified list of medicine/s, common combinations among prevalent cases on specified dates before vs after the exposure of interest

Follow-up
For population-level analyses, follow-up will start on a pre-specified calendar time point, at least 1 year before the proposed intervention, and will continue for at least 1 year after it.
For patient-level analyses, follow-up will go from the date of diagnosis (newly diagnosed cases) or prespecified date (prevalent cases) until the earliest of loss to follow-up, end of data availability, or death.
Analyses
Incidence and prevalence rate/s of disease over time will be estimated as detailed in section 3.1. Once these are available, segmented regression methods will be used to estimate the impact of the proposed intervention/s on pre- vs post-intervention change/s in trends of population-level prevalence and/or incidence. Coefficients for the segmented regression will be reported to quantify the impact of the intervention/s on the incidence and prevalence of use, together with Durbin-Watson residuals as a diagnostic. In case of autocorrelation, ARIMA/X models will be fitted instead of segmented regression if data permits.
For difference-in-difference studies, parallel trends before the intervention will be identified as a requisite for this type of study. If confirmed, Difference-in-difference models will be used to subtract the difference of the unexposed group to the exposed one whilst controlling for time varying factors, thus estimating the causal effect of the intervention.
For patient-level analyses, standardised mean differences of each of the covariates for the comparison between new cases diagnosed or prevalent cases in the pre- vs post-intervention period will be obtained as a measure of the impact of the exposure on the profile of new cases.

 













Study Type
Trend analyses and RMM effectiveness are considered complex DUS as they require bespoke modelling of interventions like risk minimization measures (RMM) after the completion of population- and/or patient-level DUS. These will typically take the form of interrupted time series to analyse the impact of a regulatory action on the use of a medicine at the population-level (e.g., incidence of use before vs after RMM) and/or at the patient level (e.g., characteristics of new drug users before vs after RMM).
Study Design
Population-level cohort and New drug user cohort
Participant/s
Population-level analyses will include the entire source population with at least some time (typically 1 year) of data visibility available before start of study period. Additional eligibility criteria could apply as in population-level DUS (see above).
Patient-level analyses will be restricted to new or prevalent users of a specified list of medicine/s or medicinal product/s during a specified time point/period, using a washout, and with potential additional eligibility criteria considered (see above).
Exposure/s
At least one RMM will have been imposed at a known date in time. This RMM (or series of RMMs) will be the main study exposure/intervention for analysis. The study period will therefore be pre-specified, and divided into before (i.e., unimpacted time) and after (i.e., impacted) calendar time.
A lag period between the publication or communication of the RMM and the start of the post-exposure study period could be considered to allow for the RMM to have an impact on the study outcome/s.
Outcome/s
The following will be estimated for a pre-specified study period, including at least 1 year before and after the RMM exposure/s of interest:

Population-based incidence rates of use of a drug/drug class over time
Population-based prevalence of use of a drug/drug class over time

At the patient level, two cohorts of new or prevalent drug user/s will be studied, namely those who initiated or were users of the treatment of interest in the period before (unimpacted) vs after the RMM (impacted). The following outcome/s will be obtained and compared for both cohorts:

New drug user cohort/s patient-level characteristics on or before index date
(Optionally) prevalent drug user cohort/s patient-level characteristics on or before index date

Follow-up
For population-level analyses, follow-up will start on a pre-specified calendar time point, at least 1 year before the imposed RMM, and will continue for at least 1 year after it.
For patient-level analyses, follow-up will go from the date of therapy initiation (for new users) or a pre-specified date (for prevalent users) until the earliest of loss to follow-up, end of data availability, or death. Patients might be censored at the time they discontinue treatment or switch to an alternative therapy, or at the date of RMM.
Analyses
Incidence and prevalence rate/s of drug/s use over time will be estimated as detailed in section 2.1. Once these are available, segmented regression methods will be used to estimate the impact of the imposed RMM/s on population-based pre- vs post-intervention trends of drug/s use. Coefficients for the segmented regression indicating the difference in trend between the periods and immediately after the intervention (step change) will be reported to quantify as a formal test of the impact of the RMM/s on the incidence and prevalence of use, together with Durbin-Watson residuals as a diagnostic. In case of autocorrelation, ARIMA/X models will be fitted instead of segmented regression, if data permits.
For patient-level analyses, standardised mean differences of each of the covariates for the comparison between new/prevalent drug users in the pre-RMM vs post-RMM period will be obtained as a measure of the impact of the RMM on the profile of new drug users. Additionally, measures of patient-level DUS will be provided, stratified by time of therapy initiation pre or post RMM.

Studies which cannot rely only on electronic health care databases, or which would require complex and/or novel methodological work.




No very complex study designs have been defined at this moment

Quality Assurance of Software Development
Software Quality Assurance, also called Software Testing Life Cycle process, aims assure that the software does what is supposed to do according to the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
The code quality assurance process within DARWIN EU will follow the agile development method as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Agile software development method
This method is continuously applied during the software lifecycle to monitor and improve the quality. The process is monitored by Quality Assessment Lead that interacts closely with the Product Owner.
It contains the following steps:

Plan: In the Plan Phase it is agreed what code will require testing and what part of this will be prioritized for the next sprint.
Design: In the design phase the Software Specification Requirements (SRS) and Test Plan are created or updated (in following sprints). The SRS provides the benchmark for test planning since it specifies all the function and non-functional requirements, in which situations it is expected to be applied in, and by whom. The Test Plan is a living document that gets updated with development sprints.
Develop: In the develop step the quality measures are implemented in the code base or get updated according to the Test Plan. This includes the creation of the unit tests etc.
Test: This is the quality control phase of the process where the software is tested according to the plan to ensure that it provides the correct results, it has cross platform compatibility, it is stable, and it is efficient. The outcome of these tests are recorded and are taken into account for the next sprint. Issues identified are flagged as bugs and are either immediately rectified in the case of significant errors (e.g. incorrect application of functionality providing false answers), or they are (deemed enhancements) to be fixed in the next development cycle of the package, e.g., the software requires too much memory.
Deploy: In this phase a major or minor software release can be created or the code is kept in development status for further improvement.

The Quality of the software development focuses on 2 main themes: 1. does the software produce the correct results. This is tested using small scale examples (units tests) where the correct answer is known. 2. Does the software run on the required platforms without producing errors. This is examined by checking, e.g., incorrect parameters, platform differences (both database management and operating systems).

Research Memory

The DARWIN EU Coordination Centre (CC) is developing libraries that store re-usable study artefacts such as concept sets or phenotype definitions. We need to make these artefacts Findable Accessible Interoperable and Re-usable (FAIR).
At the moment the CC is working on a library of OMOP-based phenotypes that can be reused (with or without modifications) to conduct studies in the DARWIN EU network:
The DARWIN EU Cohort Knowledge base (DECK)
Solid and well defined algorithms are necessary to identify people with a set of characteristics (e.g. coded diagnoses or recorded prescription/s or dispensation/s of a specific medicine) and logic (e.g. first diagnosis of a specific condition, or initiation of a specific therapy) that make them part of a cohort.
The use of the OMOP CDM enables the generation, review, and approval of transportable cohort definitions across a network of previously mapped data sources. The DARWIN EU Cohort Knowledge base (DECK for short) will compile transportable algorithms that can be used to identify cohorts necessary for the conducting of EMA-commissioned studies, including users of specific medicinal products for drug utilisation studies, people with specific conditions for the study of descriptive epidemiology, or people newly diagnosed with a specific health outcome for the study of drug safety.
DECK will leverage existing knowledge compiled by the OHDSI community, previous EHDEN studies, and other previous studies, including EMA-commissioned tenders. The existing preliminary version of DECK collates a large number of clinical definitions that have been previously produced and using during previous studies.
Where possible and/or necessary, DARWIN EU studies will leverage validated algorithms from DECK. The cumulative knowledge generated using the DECK will not only accelerate the studies conducted during Years 3-5, but also maximise the reproducibility of our research by re-using the exact same or documented variations of algorithms for the same events over time.

Studies


The DARWIN EU Coordination Centre implements all necessary services to generate reliable evidence from the real world data for the EU Regulatory network. Initially DARWIN EU will provide services to EMA and the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of the Member States. As the network expands, DARWIN EU may perform studies requested by EMA on behalf of third parties such as other EU level health agencies (e.g. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), health technology assessment bodies or payers.

For questions raised by a partner from the EU Regulatory Network and requiring additional evidence to support regulatory decision-making, EMA will frame a research question and evaluate, in consultation with the Coordination Centre, the relevance and feasibility of interrogating the network. For each study, the Coordination Centre will develop the study protocol, identify appropriate data sources for this specific question, obtain EMA approval and perform the conduct of the study with data partners. Following their local governance procedures the data partners need to obtain the mandatory institutional, IRB, and/or ethics approval.
The data partners will receive and run the code on their own databases and provide aggregated results to the Coordination Centre. The Coordination Centre will check the quality of the study data received from each data partner and perform additional data analysis steps and interpretation. The Coordination Centre will compile the results, will be responsible to draft the study report and to submit the report to EMA for approval.

The studies that DARWIN EU will deliver are grouped by their anticipated level of complexity and frequency:

The EMA will be responsible for providing leadership and direction, setting standards for DARWIN EU, contracting, instructing and overseeing the Coordination Centre and monitoring its performance.
The overall operation of DARWIN EU is overseen by the Management Pillar and with guidance from its Advisory Boards. These boards are composed of the Scientific Advisory Board, the Ethical Advisory Board, and the Data Source Prioritisation Committee. The initiative also receives oversight from the DARWIN EU Advisory Board at EMA, which you can read more about .

 













At present, the DARWIN EU CC provides a service to EMA and the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of the Member States, and therefore receives study requests from EMA on behalf of those organisations. As the network expands, DARWIN EU may perform studies requested by EMA on behalf of third parties such as other EU level health agencies (e.g. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), health technology assessment bodies or payers. You can read more about it 

 













DARWIN EU works to deliver studies as they are described in its Catalogue of Standard Data Analyses. These are categorised as Off-the-shelf, Complex, Very Complex and Routine Repeated. You can read more about it

Coordination Centre




EMA is working with Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam to:

establish theDARWIN EUCoordination Centre, and support its work to build a distributed data network;
conduct scientific studies and answer research questions supporting regulatory decision-making by EMA's scientific committees and the ;
maintain a catalogue of real world data sources for use in the regulatory context and their metadata.

The DARWIN EU Coordination Centre will be a key user of the future .
The contract to establish the Coordination Centre was awarded to Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam following a call for tender for a service provider published in June 2021.
The  group at the Department of Medical Informatics is leading the Establishment and Operational Phase of the DARWIN EU Coordination Centre.
Organisational Structure

The DARWIN EU CC exists to run studies within its data partner network, overseen by the Study and Network Operations pillars, respectively. These pillars are able to execute studies and onboard Data Partners using tools (such as code and protocols) that have been created by the Development pillar and within an infrastructure that has been created by the Technology pillar. The Technology pillar is also responsible for producing necessary project resources, such as the website and service desk. The overall operation of DARWIN EU is overseen by the Management pillar and with guidance from the Advisory Boards.

Who is involved?

DARWIN EU has multiple actors: ,  , , and .
Data Partners
DARWIN EU collaborates with data partners who help generate real-world evidence that can be used in scientific evaluations and regulatory decision-making. Data partners are partners who have access to raw data in-house or remotely, through ownership, public contract, third-party agreement or commercial license. Data partners enable DARWIN EU to use their data in its scientific studies by executing analytic packages, and provide analysis results to the DARWIN EU Coordination Centre, in accordance with data protection and governancerules. For more information see the  page.
Coordination Centre
The has a key function in DARWIN EU. The CC provides a structure for developing and managing the network of data partners, including their training on processes and study methods, evaluating their eligibility for performing studies, and monitoring the data quality. The CC will also be responsible for implementing and operating all the steps in the , from feasibility requests for studies up until the final delivery of the study report to the EMA, where results are to be integrated within the EU regulatory decision making process. In addition, the Coordination Centre will be responsible for methodological developments for DARWIN EU, as directed and instructed by EMA, and to interact with other relevant initiatives. The Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam was selected as contractor in a public tendering procedure published in June 2021 to setup the Coordination Centre for the EMA. For more information see the  page.
European Medicines Agency
The  is responsible for providing leadership and direction, setting standards for DARWIN EU, contracting, instructing and overseeing the Coordination Centre and monitoring its performance. For questions raised by the EU Medicines Regulatory Network requiring additional evidence to support regulatory decision-making, the EMA will coordinate the definition of the research question and define, with the requesting body, the study objectives and possible study design options such as the study population, exposures, outcomes and statistical measures. This information will be communicated to the Cordination Centre for a further feasibility assessment. Based on the feasibility assessment, the EMA, in consultation with the Cordination Centre, will decide on the relevance of conducting a study, specify eligibility criteria for the databases to be included, identify relevant databases and define the evidentiary standards to be applied in the studies (e.g., data quality). The EMA will process the results of the analyses and the report of specific studies, feeding results into decision-making, as appropriate. To support the establishment of the DARWIN EU, a  has been set up by EMA.
EU Medicines Regulatory Network
The EU Medicines Regulatory Network includes the EMA (encompassing its scientific committees and working parties), national competent authorities (NCAs) of Member States in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Commission. During the operation of DARWIN EU, the need for additional real-world evidence identified within the EU Medicines Regulatory Network to support regulatory activities will be submitted to and further discussed with EMA.
Other Organisations
Interactions between EMA and other organisations, institutions and projects can take place to improve the infrastructure, methodological standards and operational processes of the DARWIN EU network. These interactions could take place with, for example:

the  (EHDS), of which DARWIN EU will be a key user and will need to be fully integrated and use the services provided by the EHDS;
ongoing EU and national projects in scope of DARWIN EU and relevant to the quality, transformation, maintenance or analysis of real-world datasets, including European networking initiatives such as the (EHDEN) project, European platforms for registries or the European Reference Networks (ERNs), which has established registry platforms for rare diseases;
the  (ENCePP) network, for integration and continuously updating of good methodological practice in pharmacoepidemiology, identification of data sources and registration of studies;
regulatory authorities in third countries, to learn from their experience and to integrate learnings such as governance and methodological aspects.

Data Protection
The DARWIN EU Coordination Center (CC) executes studies in its distributed data network using a federated approach in which analytical code is shared with the data partners and only aggregated study results are shared with the CC. In this privacy-by-design approach additional measures can be added, for example a minimum cell count, to comply to local governance rules. With each data partner an  is setup that includes information about this procedure. More information about study execution can be found .
The latest version of the Record of Processing Activities (ROPA) can be found under below. For more information also see the .
