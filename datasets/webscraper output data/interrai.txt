interRAI instruments are designed to be compatible across health sectors. This improves continuity of care, promotes a person-centered approach, and improves the organizations capacity to measure clinical outcomes. Instruments are built on a core set of items with identical definitions. Additional items are added to address issues unique to the population or setting.
Most instruments use a format with a trained assessor. Increasingly our instruments also have self-report versions.
We offer several types of instruments:
Comprehensive instruments identify key factors in the persons life, including function, health, social support, service use, mood, and behavior. Status and outcome scales, care planning and resource allocation tools, and quality indicators are embedded in comprehensive instruments.
Screening instruments collect information needed to support decisions about care urgency, need for more comprehensive assessment, and referrals to other services and supports.
Quality of Life instruments capture the persons day to day experience of issues, including their care, autonomy, privacy, participation in activities, comfort, and safety. Organizations can use results to adjust a persons care plan as well as to establish person-reported experience measures (PREM) to drive quality improvement.

Licensing
For more information on licensing, please complete our 

We actively pursue partnerships with organizations and governments that wish to adopt our tools. Use is permitted only by written license with interRAI; the purchase of a Users manual does not provide a use license. Licensing usually requires royalty payments for use of our intellectual property either by software vendors or government/care providers, and requires the sharing of fully-deidentified data with interRAI solely for research purposes. Researchers use of our tools solely for research studies requires a license, but usually does not require royalties. Revenues are used solely for research and development purposes, enabling interRAI to develop new systems and update those that are already in use.
As a nonprofit corporation under the US Tax Code, interRAI holds the copyright to our assessment systems, including those for long-term care facilities (MDS Version 2.0 and 3.0 are in the public domain only within the United States), home care, palliative care, mental health (outside of Canada), intellectual disability, acute care, child and youth, and quality of life, among others.
The scales, algorithms, and case-mix measures based on these assessment instruments are not copyrighted and are thus available to everyone, although the individual items on which they are based are copyrighted.
The major clauses of our royalty-free licenses include:

the instrument is not to be changed substantially (except individual identifiers and demographics), although additional items can be added;
only licensed translations can be used;
the instrument will not be incorporated into products to be sold to or paid for by others;
the organization will make appropriate efforts to inform others of the copyright status of the instrument;
interRAIs logo and copyright notice are to appear on the form and any other publication;
authors, author institutions, and translators (as appropriate) are to be acknowledged in any document where authors would usually be listed;
electronic data from use of the instrument are to be shared with interRAI, subject to existing laws on confidentiality and data use.

Use of interRAI systems usually requires royalties. Licenses usually pertain to individual instruments and nations. Software vendors are usually required to:

develop methods to sublicense the interRAI instruments to users;
imbed export routines in their software to enable data-sharing, including with interRAI;
implement user reports for scales and other algorithms;
avoid mounting interRAI licensed products on the open web.

We will be pleased in any license negotiations to acknowledge the participation of individuals or organizations that have played a substantial role in getting the instrument to the point of implementation.

Dr. Sylvia Sherwood entered the field of Gerontology in the early 1960s, joining with the other luminaries of that era in laying the foundation for a new field of research in the social sciences.  She described the role of post-acute care decades before it became part of the health care delivery system; she influenced the early developers of the concept of assisted living and championed the application of de-institutionalization to the elderly and nursing homes, all concepts that are fundamental to current universally accepted policies in support of home and community-based services. 
As a mentor and leader, Sylvia demanded much from those around her and the results testify to her leadership. As a person, Sylvia has always been open and accessible, someone that others were pleased to call a friend. Care of the elderly is better because of her entry into the arena in the early 1960s. Her legacy is the research institute that Sylvia and Murray May began some 50 years ago. It represents the actualization of their vision that it was possible to perform the highest quality research with national and international reach in an applied setting, marrying the interests of the care delivery system for the elderly with advanced theory and research methods. Her career made a difference.

Licensing
For more information on licensing, please complete our 

We actively pursue partnerships with organizations and governments that wish to adopt our tools. Use is permitted only by written license with interRAI; the purchase of a Users manual does not provide a use license. Licensing usually requires royalty payments for use of our intellectual property either by software vendors or government/care providers, and requires the sharing of fully-deidentified data with interRAI solely for research purposes. Researchers use of our tools solely for research studies requires a license, but usually does not require royalties. Revenues are used solely for research and development purposes, enabling interRAI to develop new systems and update those that are already in use.
As a nonprofit corporation under the US Tax Code, interRAI holds the copyright to our assessment systems, including those for long-term care facilities (MDS Version 2.0 and 3.0 are in the public domain only within the United States), home care, palliative care, mental health (outside of Canada), intellectual disability, acute care, child and youth, and quality of life, among others.
The scales, algorithms, and case-mix measures based on these assessment instruments are not copyrighted and are thus available to everyone, although the individual items on which they are based are copyrighted.
The major clauses of our royalty-free licenses include:

the instrument is not to be changed substantially (except individual identifiers and demographics), although additional items can be added;
only licensed translations can be used;
the instrument will not be incorporated into products to be sold to or paid for by others;
the organization will make appropriate efforts to inform others of the copyright status of the instrument;
interRAIs logo and copyright notice are to appear on the form and any other publication;
authors, author institutions, and translators (as appropriate) are to be acknowledged in any document where authors would usually be listed;
electronic data from use of the instrument are to be shared with interRAI, subject to existing laws on confidentiality and data use.

Use of interRAI systems usually requires royalties. Licenses usually pertain to individual instruments and nations. Software vendors are usually required to:

develop methods to sublicense the interRAI instruments to users;
imbed export routines in their software to enable data-sharing, including with interRAI;
implement user reports for scales and other algorithms;
avoid mounting interRAI licensed products on the open web.

We will be pleased in any license negotiations to acknowledge the participation of individuals or organizations that have played a substantial role in getting the instrument to the point of implementation.

Quality Indicators



Care providers and governments use Quality Indicators to monitor and improve the quality of care within and across organizations. QIs are pointers that indicate potential problem areas that need further review and investigation. 




interRAI QIs:

Can be derived directly from the assessment instruments
Process and outcome indicators
Prevalence and incidence measures
Include risk adjustment





Home Care
Home Care Quality Indicators (HCQIs) include over 20 indicators covering the following domains: nutrition, medication, incontinence, ulcers, physical function, cognitive function, pain, and safety/environment.




Institutional Care
Several generations of nursing home Quality Indicators (QIs) are used worldwide. The latest version of interRAI QIs include over 30 indicators for short and long-stay residents. These quality measures show ways in which nursing homes are different from one another.




Mental Health
The 27 MHQIs reflect the clinical outcomes and safety of mental health services. Domains include mental health symptoms, behaviours, cognitive performance, daily functioning, physical pain, interpersonal conflict, and restraint use.

Screening and Risk Algorithms



MAPLe (Method for Assigning Priority Levels)
MAPLe, derived from the Home Care instrument, differentiates service seekers into five levels based on their risk of adverse outcomes. Research has demonstrated that individuals in the highest level are nearly nine times more likely to be admitted to a long- term care facility than are the lowest level. 




MI Choice
MI Choice, derived from the Home Care instrument, groups individuals in one of five categories: nursing home, home care, intermittent personal care, homemaker, and information & referral. The screen can be done over the phone (thus reducing costs) to identify persons who are not likely to meet health, cognitive, and functional criteria for home care or institutional services. 




Assessment and Service Urgency
The assessment urgency and service urgency algorithms are both derived from the Contact Assessment. They address the persons need for comprehensive assessment and initiation of community services. They can also be used in hospital emergency departments or community/hospital intake. 




DIVERT
The DIVERT is a risk scale for unplanned emergency room trips. Higher scores in the scale (1 to 6) indicate higher risk for unplanned emergency department use. 




ChAMPs
The six-level ChAMPs algorithm is used to inform the need and urgency of timing for a comprehensive face-to-face mental health assessment or service for children and youth between the ages of 4-18 years.

How Systems Develop




A comprehensive interRAI assessment instrument consists of:

A data collection form
A user manual
Triggers
Clinical Assessment Protocols, or CAPs
Status and outcome measures

interRAI instruments are built on a core set of assessment items that are considered important in all care settings. These common items have identical definitions, observation time frames, and scoring. Additional items specific to a particular care population or care setting are then added to the core item set.




interRAI ISD Committee (Instrument and Systems Development)
All instruments undergo a systematic review process before being approved. This also pertains to an updated version of an existing instrument. This work is done by the interRAI ISD Committee that meets regularly to develop, review, and approve new instruments, status and outcome measures.
Because each of the instruments in the interRAI family is in a different stage of maturity, not every instrument system in the suite necessarily contains all of these features. However, every interRAI system goes through a careful, scientifically based development process to develop instruments and decision support measures. These steps are summarized below.




Consulting with Front-Line Clinicians and Experts
Each interRAI system begins with conversations about the key clinical issues that should be assessed for a given population. Many points of view, including those of policymakers, advocates, consumers, and purchasers, are sought out to ensure that the information collected on a given instrument has utility for as many audiences as possible, while keeping the size of the instrument within bounds for everyday use.




Testing
interRAI development teams carry out extensive trials to ensure that published versions of each instrument are valid and reliable. In addition, clinical trials, studies of clinical acceptability, and longitudinal studies of care outcomes are done to test the instruments in real-life settings. Only after such work is done is the instrument considered ready for implementation in everyday clinical processes. This judgment is made by the interRAI ISD Committee.




Developing Companion Applications
interRAI research teams develop a variety of other evidence-informed applications, such as telephone screeners, quality indicators, and case-mix systems, using data generated from a given instrument. Turning data into information renders it useful to a variety of audiences, including regulators, payers, and policymakers.




Creating CAPs
A key aspect of interRAI assessment systems is written material designed to assist those involved in care planning to consider major issues triggered by the assessment. Typically these are referred to as CAPs (Clinical Assessment Protocols or or Collaborative Action Points). Each assessment protocol has been produced by a team of expert authors, drawing on empirically tested strategies whenever possible. Assessment protocols help the clinician think through what is known about a given issue, how the problem is experienced by the individual, and why it is present. Assessment protocols also examine possible prevention and treatment options, and help the assessor evaluate whether a referral for further evaluation is needed.




Providing Code to Enable Automation
interRAI hosts a geek squad that maintains production code for core scales, CAPs, and other standard applications of interRAI data used across our assessment systems. Licensed vendors and licensed users can access the code, written in SAS programming language.




Ongoing Quality Improvement
interRAI has an ongoing commitment to update our products as scientific knowledge changes, as the needs of health care consumers change, and as the health care system itself changes. Each version of a system has a unique number, for example, interRAI HC v.9.x. New versions will contain improvements in item structure, measurement definitions, CAP triggers, etc., identified from previous research and practice.

Getting Started



Implementing an interRAI Assessment System
In response to many inquiries, weve outlined some of the key issues to be addressed if your organization is interested in adopting an interRAI assessment system.




Implementation of an interRAI System Will Be a Major Reform for Your Organization
The adoption of an interRAI assessment system is likely to represent a significant change in how the organization does business. It is not simply a matter of taking a new set of data collection forms and replacing the old ones. To realize their full potential, interRAI systems depend on competent, well-trained assessors, responsive software systems, and appropriate administrative support. A successful implementation will likely require new resources  at least at startup, and maybe indefinitely  and careful planning over a period of at least several months.




Licensing with interRAI
All end users need to obtain a (free) license from interRAI to use our assessment systems. There are two kinds of licenses:

Research
User

The interRAI Web site gives a general overview of the two . We recommend that the licensing process begin immediately, as experience shows that this can be a time-consuming task in large organizations, where many parties must review and sign off. Licensure must be final before the implementation goes live.




Are Suitable Resources Available?
interRAI systems require personnel to conduct assessments, data entry personnel (ideally, the assessor), and software and administrative support staff. If your goal is simply replacing an existing software-based assessment system, then the resource requirements may not extend beyond the purchase of software. However, in many situations, implementation will represent a considerable investment in people, skills, software, and hardware that necessitates new financial resources. Implementation may also require some reconfiguration of workforce and staff skill sets. While interRAI systems often require investment in assessment personnel, this may be balanced by reductions in other staff due to efficiencies of the interRAI system and the move to an electronic environment. As a result, careful appraisal of resource needs is required. It is important to note that the use of a paper-based approach is generally inadequate, as a critical strength of interRAI systems is the extensive range of secondary clinical decision support tools that can be automatically calculated with software.




Will Potential Participants Be Screened?
Many entities screen potential participants to decide whether the person would benefit from a full assessment. The screen may be of your own design or may employ a screen developed by interRAI. In either case, it is essential to plan the rollout of the screen system. Some of the decisions that will need to be made include:

Who will do the screen?
Will the screen be done face-to-face or over the telephone?
Will the screen be computerized or performed on a paper form? If the latter, who will design the physical form and scoring instructions?
How will screeners be trained?
What quality initiatives will the organization deploy to measure reliability of screeners activities?
What is the plan when a later full assessment is performed and the person is found not eligible or appropriate?





What is the Implementation Plan for the Assessment Process?
Some of the decisions for the rollout of the full assessment system are similar to those needed in planning a screen implementation. The following is an initial list of considerations:

Who will do assessments?
How will Information flow?

Who needs assessment data and in what format?
What paperwork and duplicative processes can your organization eliminate by deploying the system?
How will assessment data be linked to services costs or other internal records?
How will raw data be transformed into information useful for policy or program administration purposes?


How will assessors be trained?

Who will provide training on three fundamental training topics: assessment tool basics, care planning, and the computer system?
Does the timing of training enable assessors to begin to use the system immediately to prevent de-training?
Does the training plan address assessor turnover?
Will you develop or acquire any competency testing to establish/maintain reliable, high-quality assessment data?


Will there be a pilot to shake down implementation procedures?
Who will be available to answer assessment questions that arise? Computer questions?





Selecting a Software System
Software systems are integral to the effective implementation of any interRAI system. Your organization must make important choices early in the planning process. Some entities choose to develop their own solutions, but the majority purchase systems available commercially or use a system developed under the auspices of their government. Development of your own solution is challenging, but has the advantage of being customized to your own agency culture. The decision to make or buy is complex, and we do not offer specific advice. However, we do offer suggestions about what to look for in an interRAI software solution.

Each software vendor must hold a license to distribute software in each nation. Check that your potential vendors hold a license for your country.

Look for the following core components in a software system:

Is the data entry section customized to your nation, particularly the administrative sections?
For clinicians:

Does the software generate a full array of available scales and other decision support measures?
Does the software generate a list of triggered clinical assessment protocols (CAPs)?
Does the software generate a clinical profile (or snapshot) of the assessed person that brings together the key observations, scales, and CAPs in an easy-to-read format? Summaries may be useful for many audiences, including other clinicians, care providers, family members, as well as the person being assessed.


For administrators:

Does the software generate quality indicators and case-mix tools, if they are available for the system that you are planning to implement?
Does it easily export data that may be required by government or other higher level bodies?
