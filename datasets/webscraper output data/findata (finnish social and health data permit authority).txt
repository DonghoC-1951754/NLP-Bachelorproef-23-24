Can data be combined to other information?
Data referred to in the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data can be combined to other information, such as data a person has collected themselves or data accessed with some other permit. As a rule, Findata or a statistics authority can combine the data.
If you wish to combine data later on to data you have received via Findata, send an amendment application for the data to be combined. For more information please see the  page.
If you are applying to have data accessed with an individuals consent to be combined with data that Findata has issued a permit for, the research subjects notification and consent models must be attached to the application.
If the data have been accessed with the permission of other actors, list the following information in the application:

Where can the data be analysed?
The aggregated statistical data accessed via a data request is sent to the customer, and it can be analysed freely in accordance with a data utilisation plan.
Data on individuals that require a data permit can only be analysed in a secure environment.
As a rule, the data will always be disclosed to Findatas secure operating environment . However, the Act on the Openness of Government Activities makes it possible to disclose information to other operating environments, if necessary. Read more below in the section:.
If an individual controller within the scope of the Act on Secondary Use has made a decision on a data permit concerning data included in their own registers, they must disclose the data to a secure environment referred to in the Act on Secondary Use as well.
Amendment permits are also officially data permits (decisions to amend data permits), meaning the same requirements apply to these as to data permits. The exception to this is changes to personal data processors.

National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health Valvira Valvira maintains a public register of the compliant operating environments notified to it. Read more on Valviras website:.
On the page youll also find information about registering in the database and registration fees.
Findatas regulation sets information security requirements for environments
We have issued a regulation in accordance with the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data, which describes the requirements laid down other service providers secure operating environments.
The regulation concerns the secondary use of social and health data, and it will be applied to all the purposes provided in the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data for which a data permit is required. These purposes include scientific research, statistics, teaching and the planning and investigation tasks of the authorities. With regard to teaching, the regulation pertains to the preparation of teaching materials, not actual teaching.
As of 1 May 2022, the implementation of the requirements laid down in the regulation is a prerequisite for the disclosure of data to be processed by the permit holder for secondary purposes in an environment other than Findatas secure operating environment Kapseli. In addition, the operating environment must be assessed by a data security assessment body that must issue a certificate on the assessment.
The requirements take into account the solutions in existing environments and enable the utilisation of different technical solutions.
At its simplest, a secure environment can be a physically and technically secure space with a terminal device for analysing data that is isolated from the Internet and other devices. On the other hand, technical solutions based on cloud services are also possible, as long as the service provider ensures the required level of data security.
The operating environments of foreign researchers must also meet the data protection and security requirements laid down in the regulation. Their validity can be demonstrated by means of certificates based on international audits, the compliance of which is verified by an assessment body approved in Finland.

Read more on the regulation on the page 

Where do I send an application for a permit?

Under the law, statistical, aggregated data subject to a data request can only be accessed via Findata.
In addition to Findata, public controllers can issue data permits, if the application is related only to data maintained by the controller in question.
Amendment permits are also officially data permits (decisions to amend data permits), meaning the authority for issuing these is determined in the same manner as for data permits.

Findata is responsible for the application and the permit decision whenever the data of data controllers covered by the Secondary Act are combined. Submit an application for a permit or change to Findata if it concerns:

data from several public social and health sector controllers
data maintained by a single public controller, that has transferred the right to issue permits to Findata




register data from one or numerous private social welfare and health care service organisers, or
customer data saved in the Kanta Services.




See the end of this page for the . Select which controllers data you are applying for access to and the assistant will tell you which authority you must submit an application to for the permit(s).



Transferred right to issue permits
Public controllers may authorise Findata to carry out on their behalf the authorisations provided for in the Secondary Act.
Therefore when a controller has transferred their authority to issue data permits to Findata, we process data permit applications and amendment applications that apply only to the information content of the specific controllers registers.
At the moment, the following controllers have transferred the right to issue permits to Findata:

Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), excluding its internal permit administration as well as the permit administration for the disclosure of samples and information transferred to the THL Biobank.
Regional State Administrative Agencies of Southern Finland, Eastern Finland, Lapland, Southwestern Finland, Western and Inland Finland and Northern Finland
National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Valvira)

Of the public data controllers, Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV), the Finnish Centre for Pensions (ETK) and Statistics Finland can not transfer their authority to issue permits to Findata.

Note that as a rule, the Secondary Use Act applies to register-based studies.
A register-based study is a study which utilises register data usually collected for other purposes or national registers. For example, the Secondary Use Act does not apply to clinical trials reported to Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea or to medical trials under the Medical Research Act.
What data can permits be issued for?
The data you can access via Findata are from social and health sector controllers on which you can find more information on the  page.
Please note that we cannot issue permits for the data of all controllers within the scope of the Secondary Use Act. More details on these data restrictions can be found in the .

Data descriptions and additional information
In accordance with the Secondary Use Act, data controllers provide advisory services concerning their own data and are the best placed to do so. If you need more information on the variables in a certain controllers data, contact the controller in question.
You can also make an agreement on the implementation of data extraction in a certain manner with the controller. In the application you send to us, specify the person with whom you have agreed to on the matter.
The National Data Catalogue at aineistokatalogi.fi contains descriptions of some of the data in the scope of the Secondary Use Act.



Which authority should a permit application be submitted to?
Findata is responsible for the application and the permit decision whenever dataare combinedfrom data controllers covered by the Secondary Use Act. The assessment of the competent authority must therefore consider all the data related to the application.
Submit the application to Findata when it applies to

data from several public social and health sector controllers
data maintained by a single public controller, that has transferred the right to issue permits to Findata




register data from one or numerous private social welfare and health care service organisers, or
customer data saved in the Kanta Services.

Under the law, statistical, aggregated data subject to a data request can only be accessed via Findata.




See the bottom of this page for the application assistant. The assistant can help in determining which authority you should send you data permit or amendment application to.


The rights listed below concerning the issuing of data permits and amendment permits also apply when not permit has been issued to any controllers information. If there is already a valid permit for some of the information, it will then be determined how many controllers have data that the applicant needs to access. In a situation where a permit is only needed for information from one public sector controller, the controller in question will issue the permit.
The Secondary Use Act does not apply to clinical trials reported to Fimea, so these are not within Fimeas competence. The definitions for interventional clinical trial and noninterventional study can be looked up in Finnish at . When necessary, Fimea will provide advice on whether a study is considered a clinical trial.
You can read more on data permit processing related competences in Finnish in section 44 of the 
Under the Secondary Use Act, public sector social and health controller are divided into two groups. Below is the more detailed division of these groups and their differences in competence.


Public sector controllers: Group 1

Regional State Administrative Agencies (AVI)
Social Insurance Institution (Kela)
Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea
National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health Valvira
Public service providers of social welfare and health care
Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (STM)
Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)
Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (TTL)

We are responsible for data permits and amendment permits when the application concerns the information of at least controllers in this group.
This is also applies in a situation where another party could be believed to have already accessed data or to have their own data. If for example, a wellbeing services county needs data from Kela in addition to their own data for a study, the application in this case concerns the data of two controllers. In this case, Findata is the competent authority.
If the application or the data utilisation plan mentions other data under the Secondary Use Act which is to be combined with the data to be retrieved, the application applies to this combined data as well.


Public sector controllers: Group 2

Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV): A persons basic personal data (e.g. birthdate, date of death, personal identity code), family relations, place of residence and building details. If other information is needed, DVV is responsible for processing applications and making permit decisions.
Finnish Centre for Pensions (ETK): Peoples employment and income data, granted benefits and their grounds including diagnoses concerning disability pensions. If other information is needed, the ETK is responsible for processing applications and making permit decisions.
Statistics Finland: Information to help in determining cause of death. If other information is needed, Statistics Finland will be responsible for processing applications and making permit decisions.

We are responsible for the data permits and amendment permits of the Finnish Centre for Pensions, the Digital and Population Data Service Agency and Statistics Finland, if in addition to them the application also concerns

information from one or more public sector controllers in Group 1
information from one or more private social welfare and health care service organisers, or
data saved in the Kanta Services

How to expediate the processing of application
The processing times for applications are affected by the content of the application, in particular, the accuracy of an extraction description, the backlog at Findata and the response times of controllers.
If there are any ambiguities concerning the completion of your application, contact the controller directly and Findatas advisory service to expediate processing.



How to speed up the processing of your application:

Check whether Findata is the competent authority to issue a permit for the data you need. 

Use the  to help in determining this. 
The exceptions to Findatas one-stop shop are the Digital and Population Data Services Agency, the Finnish Centre for Pensions, and Statistics Finland. If you need information from one or several the aforementioned controllers, these controllers are responsible themselves for the processing of applications and making permit decisions. 
If you do not know where you should send an application, contact our advisory service before sending the application:.


Contact controllers directly if you need more information about the data or variables. 

In accordance with the Secondary Use Act, the data controllers provide advisory services concerning their own data and are the best placed to do so. You can also make an agreement on the implementation of data extraction in a certain manner with the controller. 
In the application you send to us, specify the person with whom you have agreed to on the matter.
You can also contact our advisory services or use the .


Describe the information need and the register-specific data extractions as accurately as possible before sending the application.  

If the extraction includes several steps, also describe the order of extraction. Use . 
Incomplete or insufficient descriptions can lead to your application being returned to you.


Make sure that the extractions and the data you want to retrieve is essential

The principle of minimisation as defined in the GDPR is applied to the disclosure of personal data, meaning that only the essential data is disclosed. 
The extraction can be extensive provided that there are good grounds for the necessity of the data.


Complete the applicationcarefully.

Pay attention when entering basic data such as the applicant, the controller for the data to be disclosed, invoicing details and possible other data to be combined.






About the transfer of personal data outside the EU/EEA
The processing of personal data abroad is counted as a transfer of personal data even if the data is in a remote access environment.
Under the EUs General Data Protection Regulation, data can be transferred within the European Economic Area on the same grounds as within Finland. Countries belonging to the European Economic Area include the EU Member States and Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
If data is to be transferred or processed outside the aforementioned countries, i.e. in so-called third countries, there must be a legal basis for this in keeping with Chapter V of the GDPR.
The acceptable legal bases are listed below. It is sufficient that just one of these bases for data transfer is met.





									Commission decision in the adequacy of data protection under Article 45								

 

 






If the requirements for the transfer are met on this basis, no other measures are required, and we will take this criterion into account as a factor justifying the transfer in the data permit decision. This safe country principal is the primary basis for data transfer.


For more information, see .

 







									Standard contractual clauses on data protection pursuant to Article 46(2)								

 

 



Standard contractual clauses (SCC) are standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission that can be used in contracts between two controllers or between a controller and a processor.


These standard clauses can be viewed on .


If this is given as the basis for data transfer, we will take this criterion into account in the data permit decision. We will make the data available outside the EU/EEA subject to this condition and only after the applicant or permit holder has submitted to Findata the signed standard contractual clauses. The use of standard clauses will also require additional examination of the adequacy of data protection. Please note that standard contractual clauses may not be modified or added to, but must be approved as they are.

 







									Binding corporate rules pursuant to Article 47								

 

 



Binding corporate rules (BCR) refer to shared, binding rules for the transfer of personal data to third countries within a corporate group or group of companies engaged in joint economic operations.


For more information, .


If this is given as the basis for data transfer, we will take this criterion into account in the data permit decision. We will make the data available outside the EU/EEA area subject to this condition and only after the applicant or permit holder has notified the Findata of the code of conduct in question, which must have been appropriately approved by a data protection ombudsman of an EU Member State.

 







									Exceptions and safeguards under Article 49								

 

 


Exceptions and safeguards under Article 49, such as the explicit consent of the subject to the proposed transfer after being informed of the risks associated with the transfer.This basis for transfer can only be used in exceptional cases.



For more information, .


When appealing to this legal basis when utilising data subject to a permit, the controller or the processor must describe in their report on processing operations the assessment related to the transfer and the appropriate safeguards established. For more information, .


If this is given as the basis for data transfer, we will take this criterion into account in the data permit decision.

Permit fees and other costs
A fee will be charged for decisions concerning data permit applications, data requests and amendment applications and the related processing of data. The price of our services comprises the price of the decision and an hourly fee, which will be determined according to the working hours spent on combining and processing the data.
In addition to the fees charged by Findata, the final price is affected by the data extraction and delivery fees based ondecrees concerning the controllers.
When we process applications, we will ask the controller for a maximum cost estimate for extracting the necessary data. We will also give a maximum cost estimate on data processing by Findata.
We will forward these estimates to the applicant before making a decision on the permit. The final price of the data resource is confirmed after disclosing the data. A separate processing fee is charged for any expired and negative decisions.
See the  page for more information.






After applying



How does an applications processing proceed?
The processing of applications can be divided into five stages, which can be preceded by the applicant independently contacting to a controller. The process is shown in text after the graph.


The applicant contacts controllers directly before sending an application, if they need additional information on the data or variables or they need help with drawing up an extraction description.

The applicant can also make an agreement on the implementation of data extraction in a certain manner with the controller. If the customer and the controllers contact person have agreed for example that a clinician, who is part of the research team will extract the data free of charge, the applications Additional information section should include information on who this was agreed on with and in what context.


The applicant submits their application or requested additional information to Findata in the electronic application system at .

If the applicant is only submitting additional information, the clarifications can, depending on the case, also be submitted by e-mail.


Our application processors check applications and their appendices to ensure that these contain all the necessary information.

Where necessary, we will return an incomplete application for completion or we will submit a request for further clarification to the applicant.


When all the extraction descriptions have been completed, we will send additional information and cost estimate requests to the controllers whose information is requested in the application.

The purpose of the request is to determine the feasibility of the requested extraction and the maximum cost estimate for the extraction.
According to the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data, the controllers have 15 working days to respond to this request. Where necessary, controllers may ask for additional details to the request, in which case we will forward the questions to the applicant.
At this stage, we will also determine Findatas internal cost estimate, which comprises our own data processing costs.


Once all the cost estimates have been received, the applicant will be presented with a final extraction description and a maximum cost estimate for approval.

The applicant must accept both in order for the permit to be granted.
Note that it will not be possible to change the extraction conditions after this, and that changes made to the extracted data later on will require a separate application.


We at Findata will issue a positive data permit or data request decision.

Note, that data permits are always for a fixed period. If data needs to be saved for a purpose such as the verification of research or the you intend to renew your permit or the extractions must be updated at certain intervals, include these needs in your application.



How will the compilation of the applied for data proceed?
Once we have issued a data permit or made a decision on a data request, there are five different staged for the compilation of data and its pre-processing. The process is shown in text after the graph.


We will send the data requests to the controllers so that extraction can begin. Each controller has 30 working days to submit the requested data to Findata.

Depending on the nature of the project and the extraction, this phase may include several consecutive parts, such as 1. extraction of the target group; 2. extraction of the controls; 3. extraction of data.


We will begin to process the sent data. As agreed on for each project, we will check, combine and pseudonymise the data or make statistics on them in accordance with a data request.
The completed data will be handed over to the permit holder in an agreed-upon secure operating environment. Findatas secure remote operating environment  is the statutory primary option. The data can be disclosed to other operating environments, if this is necessary for the completion of the project.

The target time for the handing over of data is 60 working days. The target time will not be possible if a target group is not given immediately after the decision has been made, data extraction is carried out in several stages, deliveries by data controllers are delayed or the data is exceptionally complex.


The permit holder has three months to review the material. The permit holder must notify Findata within this given time period of any comments they wish to make on the material.

Check the data thoroughly as soon as possible. Errors that occur during extraction can accumulate, if, for example, the target group has been formed incorrectly and other controllers must carry out their own extractions all over again for this reason.


We will remove the data from our own systems four months after it has been handed over. We will retain the code keys for pseudonymised data that will enable the data to be reproduced.

Data permits are always for a fixed period. If data needs to be saved for a purpose such as the verification of research or the you intend to renew your permit or the extractions must be updated at certain intervals, include these needs in your application.



Where can the data be analysed?
The aggregated statistical data accessed via a data request is sent to the customer, and it can be analysed freely in accordance with a data utilisation plan.
Data on individuals that require a data permit can only be analysed in a secure environment.
As a rule, the data will always be disclosed to Findatas secure operating environment . However, the Act on the Openness of Government Activities makes it possible to disclose information to other operating environments, if necessary. Read more below in the section:.
If an individual controller within the scope of the Secondary Use Act has made a decision on a data permit concerning data included in their own registers, they must disclose the data to a secure environment referred to in the Act as well. Amendment permits are also officially data permits (decisions to amend data permits), meaning the same requirements apply to these as to data permits. The exception to this is changes to personal data processors.
Findatas regulation sets information security requirements for environments
We have issued a regulation in accordance with the Secondary Use Act, which describes the requirements laid down other service providers secure operating environments.
The regulation concerns the secondary use of social and health data, and it will be applied to all the purposes provided in the Act for which a data permit is required. These purposes include scientific research, statistics, teaching and the planning and investigation tasks of the authorities. With regard to teaching, the regulation pertains to the preparation of teaching materials, not actual teaching.
As of 1 May 2022, the implementation of the requirements laid down in the regulation is a prerequisite for the disclosure of data to be processed by the permit holder for secondary purposes in an environment other than Findatas secure operating environment Kapseli. In addition, the operating environment must be assessed by a data security assessment body that must issue a certificate on the assessment.
The entry into force of the requirements does not affect existing, valid permits. If data are processed on the basis of a valid permit previously granted, the processing of that data may continue in the same environment after 1 May 2022.
The requirements take into account the solutions in existing environments and enable the utilisation of different technical solutions.
At its simplest, a secure environment can be a physically and technically secure space with a terminal device for analysing data that is isolated from the Internet and other devices. On the other hand, technical solutions based on cloud services are also possible, as long as the service provider ensures the required level of data security. The operating environments of foreign researchers must also meet the data protection and security requirements.
Clinically significant findings
Based on the Section 55 of the Secondary Use Act, a data recipient can contact Findata if they make a clinically significant finding where a health-related risk could be prevented or the quality of their treatment improved. 
Findata establishes who the finding concerns and then submits the information to a specialist at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). THLs appointed specialists assess the significance of the data and the expected benefits of taking action. If the benefit is assessed to be so clear that it would be important for the patient to receive treatment, the information is then disclosed to the wellbeing services county responsible for the patients treatment. An employee of the wellbeing services county contacts the patient.
Everyone has the right to prohibit attempts to contact them based on section 55 of the Secondary Use Act. This prohibition can be set up in any operating unit that provides public health care and also online via My Kanta. Contact prohibitions cannot be set up via Findata, Kela or THL.

Kapseli is a Findata-provided secure operating environment for the processing for data on individuals that was access with a data permit. Kapseli is used via a remote connection by logging into it in a browser.
Kapseli is always data permit-specific, meaning that a new Kapseli operating environment is always created for each set of data accessed via a single data permit. A fee will be charged for each permits Kapseli environment and the same Kapseli environment cannot be used for the analysis of data accessed with different data permits.
You can use Kapseli, once

we have approved your permit application
we have aggregated the data from the controller
you have completed the Kapseli operating environment order form and
we have entered into an agreement with you on the use of Kapseli.

Inquiries related to Kapseli operating environment











How much does Kapseli cost?
See the available machine packages and their prices.



The computing packages described below and other details are selected on the order form.
The user fee for Kapseli is based on the selected computing package and possible additional orders, such as computing capacity needs exceeding XL or for the users own software. Please see our  page for all current prices.
By default, all computing packages have the following storage modes:

Work: 300 GB
Data: 300 GB
Backup: 5 GB
Output: 10 GB

The performance of Kapseli depends on the number of concurrent users and the load generated by the software used. One machine package (S/M/L/XL) is designed for approximately ten users. The price includes user rights for up to 10 users.
It is not advisable to add more than ten users to a single machine package to avoid overloading the performance. However, if the subscriber wishes to have more than 10 users on a single machine package, we will charge additional user usage fees monthly at a rate of EUR 16.16 + 24% VAT per user.
It is also possible to distribute data-specific processing across multiple parallel machine packages. Each of these machine packages must be ordered separately as individual packages. Ordering parallel machine packages may require customization, for which Findata will charge according to their pricing schedule.
Computing packages
Kapseli prices are commercially priced fee-based services to which VAT of 24% is added. The prices in the price list do not include VAT.
For example, the total cost of the Kapseli S machine package with Windows operating system is  182,90 per month ( 147,50 + (0,24 x  147,50) =  182,90).

How to use Kapseli
Read the starter guide or hop on for the more detailed operating manual.



Findatas secure operating environment Kapseli is a virtual machine, the use of which is very similar to that of the Windows remote desktop. The Windows remote desktop in turn is very similar to a computers own desktop.
To use Kapseli log in to its remote desktop with a browser. Log in will require strong, two-step identification, using Suomi.fi e-Identification and a single-use password supplied by text message.
Recommended browsers include Firefox, Chrome and Safari. The users own computer needs not have any special level of performance as the computing capacity comes from Kapseli. A sufficiently fast internet connection will make use easier.
The IP address used with Kapseli must be static, i.e. most often the organizations IP address. In general, when working remotely, the IP address of your own organization can be accessed via a remote connection, e.g. a VPN connection. If there is change in the organizations connections, ask your organizations IT support about the entire address space of IP addresses, so that the change does not hinder the use of Kapseli. Kapseli cannot be used via private IP addresses.
The most common word processing and statistics software can be used in Kapseli. Our range of software will be updated as operations develop.
If you need additional software other than those available as standard, these can be provided by additional order. Orders for additional software are made in connection with the Kapseli order or while using the Kapseli by updating the Kapseli order in . The additional software can be either access or licence based. If software requires a licence, the customer will be responsible for acquiring a licence for themself. We will charge a fee of 90.00 euros/hour (+VAT 24%) for the installation of the users own tools/software to the Kapseli machine package.

Can I transfer files to and from Kapseli myself?
All transfer of information to Kapseli and out of Kapseli happens via Findata. Kapselis remote desktop does not allow access to the internet, and the transfer and copy of information from ones own computer to the remote desktop is not possible.
Please find instructions on page 
Controllers will send the data issued with a data permit to Findata, which will then transfer these to Kapseli. At Findata, the data will be pseudonymised and processed is accordance with the informations principle of minimisation before it is transferred to the customers use.
The principle of minimisation means that the customer is given personal data for processing only in the scope that these are absolutely necessary for the purpose in question.
The results of an analysis based on data can be exported from the system via a check procedure by Findata. Findata checks that the results are sufficiently anonymous, after which the results can also be published.
In addition, we can, when necessary, transfer the data to a secure operating environment other than Kapseli. This can only be done when absolutely necessary, however, and this other user environment must comply with the Findata data security requirements.

Use of Kapseli on the basis of permits issued by other authorities
Kapseli can also be used in situations where some other authority has issued a permit. In this case, we will charge for 2 hours of work (EUR 147 /hour) related to receiving and checking the data and transferring them to Kapseli.
A more detailed description on how to order and use Kapseli is provided above.






Kapseli pause service
You can pause your Kapseli operating environment for a set period of time.



You can pause your Kapseli processing environment, after which the current machine package will be disabled for the duration of the pause. During the pause, we maintain the processing environment and the materials within, but the users do not have access to it.
During the pause, the Kapseli order must be valid, but only the monthly pause fee will be charged. The standard Kapseli conditions are also valid for the duration of the pause.
When the scheduled pause ends, users can start to log in to Kapseli once again. You will begin to be charged the monthly machine package fee for Kapseli.
The pause can be ordered through our customer service. The minimum pause is two calendar months and the maximum pause is the duration of the Kapseli order in question. The period of notice for the pause is one calendar month.
The processing time for all Kapseli orders is one month.





									Processing times for pause service								

 

 


The processing time for all Kapseli orders is one month. The minimum pause is two calendar months and the maximum pause is the duration of the Kapseli order in question. The period of notice for the pause is one calendar month.


Example 1: Kapseli was originally ordered for the period 1.1.202231.12.2025, and the orderer would like to pause the environment for the period 1.10.20221.12.2023.



Order the pause no later than August 31 2022, because there is one month processing time for orders.



Example 2: Kapseli has been put on pause from 1 October 2022 to 1 December 2023, but they want to use it again as early as 1 July 2023.



Terminate the pause no later than 30 April 2023. Orders have a one-month processing time and the pause service has a one-month period of notice.

 




Pricing
Kapseli prices are commercially priced fee-based services to which VAT of 24% is added. The prices in the price list do not include VAT.
For example, the pause service processing fee is in total  347,20 ( 280,00 + (0,24 x  280,00) =  347,20).
ProductPrice + VAT 24 % Further informationPause processing fee280,00 EURThe processing fee is invoiced as part of new pause orders and when ordering an extension to a pause.Monthly fee46,00 EURBilled per month for the duration of the pause order.






Data storage service for Kapseli users
A data storage service is available for Kapseli users to store research data after the analysis phase.



The data storage service enables a storage of research data and scripts after analysis, if there is a justified need. This could be, for example, peer review. You can order the storage service for a minimum of one year and need a valid data permit for the entire storage period.
Kapseli processing environment and storage service cannot be used at the same time. Materials can only be located in one of them at a time.
How to order the storage service?
The storage service is an additional Kapseli service and is only available for those with a Kapseli order. The storage service must be ordered at least four weeks before the end of your Kapseli subscription.
At the moment, it is not possible to order only the storage service. If the data has been analysed in another secure processing environment than Kapseli, you must first order Kapseli and then the storage service.
The storage service can be ordered for a minimum of one year and requires a valid data permit for the entire storage period. If the data permit is not valid for the entire desired storage period, you should first apply for an extension of the validity of the data permit with a data permit amendment application in . If the data permit has not been granted by Findata, we request that you contact the data permit issuer to extend the validity period.
The storage service can be ordered for a maximum of five years at a time and only a representative of the permit holder can place orders related to the storage service of the material. The continuation of the order is possible in accordance with the current terms of service and price list. Order a continuation of the storage service at least one month before the end of the previous subscription. In order for the order to continue smoothly, ensure that the data permit covers the entire planned retention period when placing the order.
How does the storage service work?
When the storage service is deployed, Kapseli and any software customisations will be removed. 
The storage service stores the materials produced with the data permit, as well as any files related to the research, such as code scripts. All files from the Kapseli D:, W:, and B: drives will be transferred to the storage service. The file format does not matter. 



Keep these in mind

It is your responsibility to store the data in a file format that allows it to be processed after restoration. The data will be transferred to the storage service in the status indicated by the start date of the data storage service.
In connection with the implementation of the data storage service, you will be sent a security email with an encryption key and a unique identifier. The most reliable way to open the encryption key file is with Notepad. The encryption key and the unique identifier are required to re-implement the data. Without these, it is not possible to return the data from the storage service. It is your responsibility to keep the encryption key and the unique identifier safe during the storage service. 




Cancellation of the storage service
If you want to terminate your storage service order before your order ends, you must order it separately in . The cancellation must be ordered at least one month before the desired cancellation date.
After your storage service order has ended, the material will be removed from the service. Findata will not store the data after the order has ended. 
Returning material for use in the Kapseli or other secure processing environment
If necessary, the data can be returned for analysis in a new Kapseli processing environment and transferred back to the storage service after processing. Order a transfer from the storage service to Kapseli at least one month before the desired date. To return the material, place an order for Kapseli before sending the return request.
The data sets from the data storage system can also be transferred to another secure processing environment that has been accepted to the Toini secondary use register maintained by Valvira. For the use of Kapseli or data transfer to the secure processing environment of a third-party service provider, we will charge the work costs for the starting hour in accordance with the Kapseli price list.
Pricing for the storage service
The price of the storage service is reviewed annually. The processing fee and the first 12 months fee will be invoiced at the time of setup. After the first year, you will be invoiced in advance every six months.
Kapseli prices are commercially priced fee-based services to which VAT of 24% is added. The prices in the price list do not include VAT.
For example, the storage service processing fee is  570,40 in total ( 460,00 + (0,24 x  460,00) =  570,40).

When will the data be erased from Kapseli?
See your options after the expiry of the Kapseli operating environment order.



At the expiry of the Kapseli operating environment order, users are disconnected from Kapseli and the data is permanently erased. Findata does not retain a copy of the data.
The data will be permanently deleted even if the data permit is valid after the expiry of the Kapseli order. A data permit is not a legal basis for the storage of data. The storage of data requires an active order for an audited operating environment or a storage service.
Alternatively, you can

continue using Kapseli by placing a new Kapseli order in the e-service,
continue using Kapseli and pause the use of Kapseli for a fixed period of time (a valid Kapseli order is required for pausing the service) or
order a long-term data storage service for the data.

If the customer fails to inform Findata of the follow-up measures after the expiry of the Kapseli order, we will permanently delete the Kapseli operating environment, and any data sets and other files and software stored in Kapseli.
A valid data permit is a prerequisite for pausing or continuing the use of the Kapseli or ordering of the data storage service. You can apply for the extension of the validity of a data permit with a data permit amendment application.

									Can the data I received via Findata be combined to other information?								

 

 


Data referred to in the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data can be combined to other information, such as data a person has collected themselves or data accessed with some other permit. As a rule, Findata or a statistics authority combines the data.


If you wish to combine data later on to data you have received via Findata, send an amendment application for the data to be combined. For more information please see the .


If you are applying to have data accessed with an individuals consent to be combined with data that Findata has issued a permit for, the research subjects notification and consent models must be attached to the application.


If the data have been accessed with the permission of other actors, list the following information in the application:



Permit record number, issuer, date of decision.


If the permit process is pending, the party to whom the application was submitted and the permit process start date.


A brief description of the information content of other data.


Do not attach permits for other data to the application. The application processor will ask for these separately of necessary.



See the instructions for sending data on the page .
 







									How do I safely exit Kapseli?								

 

 


There are two ways to stop using the remote desktop.

									Maintenance has made fixes or updates to Kapseli, but they dont show up  what do I do?								

 

 


Make sure that you have disconnected or logged out of Kapseli after receiving a response from the administrator that repairs or changes have been made. Some changes do not take effect in the middle of a session, so you will need to log back into Kapseli for them to take effect.

									What is anonymisation and pseudonymisation?								

 

 


Anonymisation means the transformation of personal data into a form that irreversibly prevents the identification of an individual person. This may mean, for example, removing direct identifiers and simplifying the data to a general level so that personal data cannot be reconstituted in any way.


Pseudonymisation refers to the transformation of personal data, for example into a coded form. In this case, names and personal identifiers can be removed and replaced by another unique identifier, i.e. a code. Often a code key is kept to restore direct personal data to the data. Pseudonymised data are still personal data.

Expiry decisions
A fee is charged for expired permit applications. The amount of this fee depends on the permit applied for and the stage to which the processing of the application has progressed before the applicant withdraws it.





									How does an applications processing proceed?								

 

 


The processing of applications can be divided into five stages, which can be preceded by the applicant independently contacting to a controller. The process is shown in text after the graph.






The applicant contacts controllers directly before sending an application, if they need additional information on the data or variables or they need help with drawing up an extraction description.

The applicant can also make an agreement on the implementation of data extraction in a certain manner with the controller. If the customer and the controllers contact person have agreed for example that a clinician, who is part of the research team will extract the data free of charge, the applications Additional information section should include information on who this was agreed on with and in what context.




The applicant submits their application or requested additional information to Findata in the e-services at 

If the applicant is only submitting additional information, the clarifications can, depending on the case, also be submitted by e-mail.




Our application processors check applications and their appendices to ensure that these contain all the necessary information.

Where necessary, we will return an incomplete application for completion or we will submit a request for further clarification to the applicant.




When all the extraction descriptions have been completed, we will send additional information and cost estimate requests to the controllers whose information is requested in the application.

The purpose of the request is to determine the feasibility of the requested extraction and the maximum cost estimate for the extraction.


According to the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data, the controllers have 15 working days to respond to this request. Where necessary, controllers may ask for additional details to the request, in which case we will forward the questions to the applicant.


At this stage, we will also determine Findatas internal cost estimate, which comprises our own data processing costs.




Once all the cost estimates have been received, the applicant will be presented with a final extraction description and a maximum cost estimate for approval.

The applicant must accept both in order for the permit to be granted.


Please note that it will not be possible to change the extraction conditions after this, and that changes made to the extracted data later on will require a separate application.




We at Findata will issue a positive data permit or data request decision.

Please note, that data permits are always for a fixed period. If data needs to be saved for a purpose such as the verification of research or the you intend to renew your permit or the extractions must be updated at certain intervals, include these needs in your application.



 




Payment categoryCriteriaPriceFree of charge expiry decisionThe applicant withdraws the application before Findata has started processing it.EUR 0,00Charge of approx. 20% of the permit feeThe applicant withdraws the application when Findata has started processing the application but before the cost estimate requests for data extraction have been sent to the controllers.Hourly charge of 88,00 EUR /hourCharge of approx. 60% of the permit feeThe applicant withdraws the application after the cost estimate requests for data extraction have been sent to the controllers but before a cost estimate summary has been sent to the applicant.Hourly charge of 88,00 EUR /hourCharge of approx. 75% of the permit feeThe applicant withdraws the application after receiving the cost estimate summary.Hourly charge of 88,00 EUR /hourNo VAT is charged on expiry decisions.
Ready-made datasets
Price categoryCriteriaPriceFindatas ready-made datasetData permit for Findatas ready-made dataset, when no other data are combined with it.For the FinRegistry data, in addition to the data permit fee, Findatas extraction costs are charged based on the amount of work. The COVID-19 material consists of pre-assembled modules, so no extraction costs are charged.For COVID-19 data set, the delivery of the data to Kapseli is free of charge. Delivery to another service providers processing environment: two working hours, i.e. 294 EUR (VAT +0%). We inform the customer of the costs if the estimate exceeds two hours.300,00 EURNo VAT is charged on permit decisions.

Price categoryCriteriaPriceData processingHourly fee for data combining, pre-processing, pseudonymisation and anonymisation. Minimum one hour.147,00 EUR/hourCosts of processing a lapsed applicationIf the application for a data permit or data request is canceled or not completed after the start of the processing, we will charge a proportion of the workload.88,00 EUR/hourHourly payments are services under public law, which are not subject to VAT.
Kapseli secure processing environment
By default, all computing packages have the following storage modes:

Work: 300 GB
Data: 300 GB
Backup: 5 GB
Output: 10 GB

The performance of Kapseli depends on the number of concurrent users and the load generated by the software used. One machine package (S/M/L/XL) is designed for approximately ten users. The price includes user rights for up to 10 users.
It is not advisable to add more than ten users to a single machine package to avoid overloading the performance. However, if the subscriber wishes to have more than 10 users on a single machine package, we will charge additional user usage fees monthly at a rate of EUR 16.16 + 24% VAT per user.
It is also possible to distribute data-specific processing across multiple parallel machine packages. Each of these machine packages must be ordered separately as individual packages. Ordering parallel machine packages may require customization, for which Findata will charge according to their pricing schedule.
Computing packages
Kapseli prices are commercially priced fee-based services to which VAT of 24% is added. The prices in the price list do not include VAT.
For example, the total cost of the Kapseli S machine package with Windows operating system is  182,90 per month ( 147,50 + (0,24 x  147,50) =  182,90).

Kapseli pause service
You can pause your Kapseli processing environment, after which the current machine package will be disabled for the duration of the pause. During the pause, we maintain the processing environment and the materials within, but the users do not have access to it.
During the pause, the Kapseli order must be valid, but only the monthly pause fee will be charged. The standard Kapseli conditions are also valid for the duration of the pause.
When the scheduled pause ends, users can start to log in to Kapseli once again. You will begin to be charged the monthly machine package fee for Kapseli.
The pause can be ordered through our customer service. The minimum pause is two calendar months and the maximum pause is the duration of the Kapseli order in question. The period of notice for the pause is one calendar month.
The processing time for all Kapseli orders is one month.





									Processing times for pause service								

 

 


The processing time for all Kapseli orders is one month. The minimum pause is two calendar months and the maximum pause is the duration of the Kapseli order in question. The period of notice for the pause is one calendar month.


Example 1: Kapseli was originally ordered for the period 1.1.202231.12.2025, and the orderer would like to pause the environment for the period 1.10.20221.12.2023.



Order the pause no later than August 31 2022, because there is one month processing time for orders.



Example 2: Kapseli has been put on pause from 1 October 2022 to 1 December 2023, but they want to use it again as early as 1 July 2023.

Data storage service
The data storage service enables a storage of research data and scripts after analysis, if there is a justified need. This could be, for example, peer review. You can order the storage service for a minimum of one year and need a valid data permit for the entire storage period.
Kapseli processing environment and storage service cannot be used at the same time. Materials can only be located in one of them at a time.
How to order the storage service?
The storage service is an additional Kapseli service and is only available for those with a Kapseli order. The storage service must be ordered at least four weeks before the end of your Kapseli subscription.
At the moment, it is not possible to order only the storage service. If the data has been analysed in another secure processing environment than Kapseli, you must first order Kapseli and then the storage service.
The storage service can be ordered for a minimum of one year and requires a valid data permit for the entire storage period. If the data permit is not valid for the entire desired storage period, you should first apply for an extension of the validity of the data permit with a data permit amendment application in . If the data permit has not been granted by Findata, we request that you contact the data permit issuer to extend the validity period.
The storage service can be ordered for a maximum of five years at a time and only a representative of the permit holder can place orders related to the storage service of the material. The continuation of the order is possible in accordance with the current terms of service and price list. Order a continuation of the storage service at least one month before the end of the previous subscription. In order for the order to continue smoothly, ensure that the data permit covers the entire planned retention period when placing the order.
How does the storage service work?
When the storage service is deployed, Kapseli and any software customisations will be removed. 
The storage service stores the materials produced with the data permit, as well as any files related to the research, such as code scripts. All files from the Kapseli D:, W:, and B: drives will be transferred to the storage service. The file format does not matter. 



Keep these in mind

It is your responsibility to store the data in a file format that allows it to be processed after restoration. The data will be transferred to the storage service in the status indicated by the start date of the data storage service.
In connection with the implementation of the data storage service, you will be sent a security email with an encryption key and a unique identifier. The most reliable way to open the encryption key file is with Notepad. The encryption key and the unique identifier are required to re-implement the data. Without these, it is not possible to return the data from the storage service. It is your responsibility to keep the encryption key and the unique identifier safe during the storage service. 




Cancellation of the storage service
If you want to terminate your storage service order before your order ends, you must order it separately in . The cancellation must be ordered at least one month before the desired cancellation date.
After your storage service order has ended, the material will be removed from the service. Findata will not store the data after the order has ended. 
Returning material for use in the Kapseli or other secure processing environment
If necessary, the data can be returned for analysis in a new Kapseli processing environment and transferred back to the storage service after processing. Order a transfer from the storage service to Kapseli at least one month before the desired date. To return the material, place an order for Kapseli before sending the return request.
The data sets from the data storage system can also be transferred to another secure processing environment that has been accepted to the Toini secondary use register maintained by Valvira. For the use of Kapseli or data transfer to the secure processing environment of a third-party service provider, we will charge the work costs for the starting hour in accordance with the Kapseli price list.
Pricing for the storage service
The price of the storage service is reviewed annually. The processing fee and the first 12 months fee will be invoiced at the time of setup. After the first year, you will be invoiced in advance every six months.
Kapseli prices are commercially priced fee-based services to which VAT of 24% is added. The prices in the price list do not include VAT.
For example, the storage service processing fee is  570,40 in total ( 460,00 + (0,24 x  460,00) =  570,40).
ProductPrice + VAT 24 %Further informationStorage service processing fee460,00 EURA processing fee and a minimum order of 12 months will be invoiced in connection with a new storage order.Monthly charge for the storage service per 0.5 TB7,00 EUR/month (42,00 EUR/6 months)Billed every six months.



Invoicing
1. Fee for Findata data request or data permit

We invoice for a decision on a data request or issuing of a data permit once the decision has been made or the permit has been granted.

2. Data extraction, processing and delivery

We find out the data controllers costs for extracting and delivering the data as part of our processing of the data request or data permit and provide this information to the applicant. We also give the applicant an estimate of the maximum cost for Findatas data-processing work.
We invoice for the controllers costs and the time spent by Findata processing the data once the data have been disclosed to the decision recipient or permit holder. Regarding the costs of the controllers, Findata treats the invoice as a pass-through item in its accounting. Thus, the controller determines the VAT liability based on the final payer of the invoice.
If the estimated costs of the registrars extractions and Findatas data processing exceed 5,000 euros, we invoice non-domestic public administration organizations for 70% in advance and foreign operators for 90% of the costs. Pre-invoicing can also be done at the licensees request with the desired percentage, if it is higher than the aforementioned minimum percentage. Domestic public administration organizations are not invoiced in advance without a separate request.

3. Use charge for Kapseli secure processing environment

We invoice the use charge for the remote access environmenton a monthly basis, according to the months of use.
We reserve the right to change the prices for the remote access environment if changes take place to the procurement costs for the remote access environment independently of Findatas operations.

Payment periods and terms
The invoice payment period is 21 days for Finnish customers and 30 for foreign customers.
Findata charges interest annually on overdue invoices in accordance with the amount laid down in  and complying with the provisions otherwise laid down in the Interest Act. Instead of charging interest on overdue payments, Findata may alternatively charge a flat-rate late payment fee of EUR 10 if the quantity of interest charged would be smaller than this.

Counselling service

We provide advisory services on this website and via email at .
We provide answers to questions concerning such things as the submission of data, data descriptions and general questions concerning the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data


Support for creating data descriptions

Organisations within the scope of the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data in their role as controllers have a statutory obligation to draw up data descriptions on the information content in their information resources in accordance with the Findata Regulation. This is important so that those who need data can assess the suitability of the data for secondary use.
We provide free tools for controllers: Data editor, with which data descriptions can be drawn up and a Data catalogue where data descriptions can be published.
In addition, we help controllers in creating data descriptions by providing training on the use of the aforementioned tools.


Anonymisation service

If the secondary data use application relates to only one public social and health sector controller, that controller is themselves responsible for processing the data permit application and making the permit decision. However, if the data is disclosed to the permit holder in anonymised form, we will anonymise the data on behalf of the controller and deliver it for the permit holders use.


Processing of data permit and amendment applications by the controller

Public controllers may authorise Findata to carry out on their behalf, as detailed in the Secondary Data Act, services other than advice and data description services. In such cases, we also process on behalf of the controller those data permit and amendment applications which relate only to the content of the controllers own registers.
For information on controllers who have transferred their authority to issue permits, see the  page section titled

									Can the data I received via Findata be combined to other information?								

 

 


Data referred to in the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data can be combined to other information, such as data a person has collected themselves or data accessed with some other permit. As a rule, Findata or a statistics authority combines the data.


If you wish to combine data later on to data you have received via Findata, send an amendment application for the data to be combined. For more information please see the .

See the instructions for sending data on the page .
 







									How does the data controller provide the extracted data to Findata?								

 

 


For instructions on how data controllers can submit extracted data, see the .
 







									Can my information be disclosed abroad?								

 

 


Free movement of data within the EU is required under the General Data Protection Regulation. However, the law requires that the data is mainly processed in the centralised, secure user environment of the data permit authority for the social and health care sector, and that access rights to the environment may only be granted to authorised persons. The permit holder may also be located elsewhere than in Finland. The provision of a data secure user environment is an essential technical measure to safeguard the protection of personal data.


If necessary, the data may be disclosed to another secure environment indicated by the permit holder. However, this other environment must meet the criteria of the Findata order, it must be audited against the requirements of the order, and its audit certificate must be valid. Valvira maintains the Toini register, and in these cases also the information should only be used for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the permit holder. The EUs General Data Protection Regulation specifies the conditions under which data can be disclosed outside the EU.


Health and social data may not be used for marketing or the determination of individual commercial services, such as insurance premiums.
 







									Will my data be sold to third parties?								

 

 


No. Findata is the Health and Social Data Permit Authority that grants temporary permits for the secondary processing of social and health care data provided that the statutory permit conditions are met.
 







									How can I prohibit the secondary use of my data?								

 

 


Everyone has the right to their personal data and the right to object to the processing of the data. We have compiled instructions on how to exercise your right of objection on the webpage Data protection and processing of personal data.


It should be noted that Findata is not the original controller of health and social data. Thus, for example, a request submitted to Findata to object to the use of personal data does not prevent the disclosure of the data for secondary use by one of the controllers referred to in the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data (Secondary Use Act), Section 6.


Unfortunately, Finland does not have a centralised system through which the secondary use of data can be banned once and for all in a way that is binding on all parties. 


You can submit a objection request directly to the other actors referred to in Section 6 of the Secondary Use Act: 



social welfare and health care service providers, 


the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, 


the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), 


the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela), 


the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health, 


the Regional State Administrative Agencies, 


the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, 


Fimea, 


Statistics Finland, 


the Central Pension Insurance Institute and 


the Digital and Population Data Services Agency.

 







									What is the difference between primary and secondary use of health and social data?								

 

 


Primary use means the purpose for which the data was originally saved in the customer register and/or patient register. 


The primary purpose may be, for example, 



examination, treatment and rehabilitation of the patient, 


the service received by a social welfare customer, 


or the processing of benefits by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela).



Secondary use means the use of the same data for purposes other than the primary use. 


Legitimate secondary purposes of use include 



scientific research, 


statistics, 


development and innovation activities, 


education, 


knowledge management, 


steering and supervision by authorities and 


the planning and reporting duty of an authority.



Different purposes of use are subject to different regulations. Only aggregated statistics from which individuals cannot be identified may be obtained for development and innovation activities.
 







									Can I collect the data myself from my own hospital and thus avoid the data controllers collection fee?								

 

 


Yes, you can, if this is okay with the controller. The controller has the right to determine independently the manner in which it carries out the extraction, and it has the right to use an external processor to carry out the data extraction.


If such processors are used, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that a data protection agreement (DPA) covering the processing of personal data is signed with them. The controller is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the personal data is processed in a legal manner. The processor, meanwhile, is responsible for ensuring that it complies with the terms of the DPA and the instructions of the controller.


The collected data must be delivered to Findata securely via the transfer service Nextcloud, after which we combine and pre-process them.
 







									Do the collection fees charged by the controllers include VAT?								

 

 


This depends on the controller. The data controllers determine their own collection fees on the basis of their own regulations.
 







									Why is the VAT rate 0% for some payments and 24% for others?								

 

 


Findatas prices are based on the decree of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health on charges for work carried out by the Health and Social Data Permit Authority.


With the exception of Kapseli, the service prices are for actions under public law that are based on cost value (VAT 0 %). The prices for Kapselis services are commercially priced paid services with 24% VAT.


The data controllers determine their own costs on the basis of their own regulations.
 







									On average, how much are Findatas data processing charges?								

 

 


On the page  (in Finnish), you can find the average, range and median calculated from the maximum cost estimates. The data is updated quarterly.
 







									What are the average collection fees for data controllers?								

 

 


You can find the average, the range and the median calculated from the maximum cost estimates for data extractions in Finnish on the . We update the data quarterly.
 







									Can someone other than the permit holder receive the invoices?								

 

 


Possibly. Any inconsistencies between the applicant and the invoiced party (e.g. the payer is not the applicant) can be clarified where necessary in the Additional information section.
 







									Can I receive a paper invoice?								

 

 


E-invoicing is the primary invoicing method. Paper invoices are only possible in exceptional cases. As a rule, however, the invoice recipient are organisations that only accept e-invoices. If necessary, ask for more information from your organisations financial department.

Tasks and objectives



Our task is to provide guidance, grant permits for the secondary use of social and health data and to ensure that data subject to a permit is combined and disclosed in an secure manner.
We grant permits for the secondary use of social and health data when the application applies to

data maintained by several public social and health sector controllers
data maintained by a single public controller, that has transferred the right to issue permits to Findata
the register data of one or numerous private social and health service provider, or
data saved in the Kanta Services

We are responsible for the combining and pre-processing of data subject to a permit, such as the production of pseudonymised and anonymised, statistical data.
Our goal:

Improve data security and the data protection of individuals.
Speed up and streamline the utilisation of social welfare and health care data resources.
Decrease the duplication of work in permit processing.
Develop data descriptions for the social welfare and health care sector together with the controllers.

Legitimate purposes for the secondary use of social and health data will depend on what type of data is being used.

FinHITS  Strengthening Finnish Health Data ICT for Secondary Use















Join us on our four-year mission to strengthen the Finnish health data infrastructure and promote efficient and secure secondary use of health data, making us ready to launch into the European Health Data Space.



Finnish Social and Health Data Permit Authority Findata was established in 2019 following enforcement of the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data. We have been operational since the beginning of 2020, making us one of the first centralised health data permit authorities in the European Union.
At the moment, we offer our customers and controllers a set of baseline services. With the European Health Data Space (EHDS) on the horizon, now is the time to use our unique hands-on experience to further develop our services and make them even more user-friendly and secure for efficient secondary use.
To enable Finlands smooth participation in the upcoming EHDS, we are launching FinHITS  a four-year project co-funded by the European Union that aims to strengthen Finnish health data ICT for secondary use.



FinHITS will focus on:

Increasing the capabilities of our data access applications management system
Developing the national dataset catalogue for health data
Strengthening Kapseli, our secure processing environment for health data
Creating a cross-border gateway to connect with the HealthData@EU infrastructure
Elevating the quality of health data



Through FinHITS, we are strengthening the Finnish data infrastructure to ensure efficient and secure secondary use of health data. As a result, Finland is ready to integrate seamlessly into the EHDS.
By sharing our experiences, we aim to help other countries in building their systems, steering clear of needless pitfalls along the way.

Your rights to your data





When we process personal data as a data controller, you as a data subject have rights to your personal information. On this page you can find information about the rights of the data subject and how you can exercise them.
The data subject refers to the person to whom the original social and health information relate.
To find out how we process personal data, what personal data we collect and the basis for processing personal information, see our .






What rights do you have?


Everyone has the right to access, rectify, restrict and object to the processing of their data.










Exercising your rights


As a rule, we can only execute the data subjects requests regarding the data in our possession. 










Minors and data subject rights


Minors have the same rights as adults when processing personal data under the Secondary Use Act.












When is the exercise of rights not possible?


With regard to scientific research and the compilation of statistics, it is possible to restrict the rights of a data subject on a case-by-case basis.










How can I exercise my rights?


You can exercise your rights using a form. The exercise of these rights requires verification of the identity of the data subject. 










How can I cancel the exercise of my rights?


Any person who has submitted a data processing objection request can cancel the exercise of their rights.













What are your rights related to the processing of personal data?



As a data subject, you have the right to receive information about how we use your personal data. This information is available in the privacy notices on our 
In addition, you have the following rights when we process your personal data:

Right of access to your personal data
Right to rectify your data
Right to restrict the processing of your data 
Right to object to the processing of your data 

Read more by clicking on the sub-headings.





									Right of access to your personal data (Article 15 of the GDPR)								

 

 


You have as the data subject the right to obtain a copy of your personal data processed by Findata.


In addition, you have the right to be informed of:



where your personal data was obtained


why your personal data is needed


for how long your personal data is needed


whether your personal data have been disclosed and, if so, where.


whether your personal data has been transferred outside the EU and what safeguards have been applied to it under the GDPR


whether the processing is carried out using automation and


how you can exercise your rights in relation to your personal data.

 









									Right to rectify your data (Article 16 of the GDPR)								

 

 


You have as a data subject the right to correct inaccurate data processed by Findata.
 









									Right to restrict the processing of your data (Article 18 of the GDPR)								

 

 


Data subjects have the right to restrict the processing of their data in certain circumstances. Processing may also be restricted as a result of other requests without the data subjects explicit request.


You may request Findata to restrict the processing of your personal data in the following situations:



if your data is incorrect


if your data are processed unlawfully but you do not want them to be deleted


if Findata no longer needs the data for the original purpose, but you need them for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims


if you have objected to the processing of your data but the final decision is still under consideration



If we restrict the processing of your data, we will, where possible, inform all those to whom the data have previously been disclosed of the restriction.
 









									Right to object to the processing of your data (Article 21 of the GDPR)								

 

 


The data subject has the right to object to the processing of personal data by us at any time on grounds relating to their particular situation. In this case, we shall no longer process the data relating to this person, unless there are substantial and legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
 











Exercising your rights



If you wish to exercise these rights, you can find the necessary instructions on this page under section 
As a rule, Findata can only execute the data subjects requests regarding the data in its possession. The right to access personal data, the right to rectify personal data and the right to restrict the processing of personal data concern the data held by Findata at the time of filing the request.
On the other hand, a request concerning the right to object may be made for an indefinite period. We maintain a separate list of data subjects who have submitted a request to object. We record all requests we receive in a diary.
We retain personal data only for the time necessary to compile the data and to verify the accuracy of the data. If the data subject requires their personal data in order to prepare, present or defend a legal claim, the request concerning the matter should be submitted directly to the original controller of the data, for example, a healthcare provider.
For example, the Digital and Population Data Services Agency has the data concerning a persons family relations, marital status and address, hospitals have data on the persons treatment, and the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) has data on the prescriptions issued to the person. Information about controllers and the data contents of registers is available on the.






Minors and data subject rights



Minors have the same rights as adults when processing personal data under the Secondary Use Act. The basic principle is that a minor who is able to form their own views is free to express their views on the use and processing of their personal data.
Can a child decide themselves whether to make requests?
In the case of minors, it is not possible to issue specific recommendations on the age at which a minor can independently decide on the use and processing of their data.
If taking into account their age and level of development the child is able to understand the matter and its significance, then they can decide on the exercise of their rights. Of course, this is not possible for very young children, but the older the child or young person is, the more decision-making power they have. 
The guardian may make a request on behalf of the child  attach a certificate of custody or other legal representation of the child
The guardian of an underage child may make, on the behalf of the child, a request that relates to the childs rights as a data subject. In cases of joint custody, the request should be made and signed by both guardians. A certificate of custody obtained from the Population Information System must be attached to the request. The request should be in accordance with the assumed desires of the child and should represent their best interests.
It is recommended that the guardians discuss the request with the child and hear the childs opinion on the matter before making the request, even if the child is not yet able to make a decision on the matter. Requests for underage children must be made as separate messages through the Suomi.fi service so that they can be entered in the register as separate entities.
Inform the child
The guardians should inform the underage child of the request made on their behalf at the latest when the child is at an age and level of development where they can understand the matter. This is particularly important in situations where guardians have objected to the processing of personal data on behalf of a minor. Data processing objection requests are valid until further notice and thus continue to be valid even after the minor becomes an adult.






When is the exercise of rights not possible?



The exercise of rights is not possible always in all situations.
With regard to scientific research and the compilation of statistics, it is possible to restrict the rights of a data subject on a case-by-case basis. In that case, a separate impact assessment must have been prepared concerning the research project, and it must have been submitted to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman prior to initiating the project. In such cases, we consider whether the data can be disclosed despite the data subjects objection.
Permit applicants have the possibility to limit the right of data subjects to object to the processing of personal data for educational purposes, if the processing of personal data is necessary due to the rarity of the case.
When a data subject objects to the processing of their personal data by Findata, we erase the data concerning the data subject from its systems. If the data has been disclosed before the data subject has objected to the processing, the data cannot, as a rule, be erased. 
As a general rule, data subjects rights are not restricted and data subjects requests are complied with. We will limit the processing of personal data for the period during which this consideration is being made.







How can I exercise my rights?



To exercise your rights, please complete the form below. Complete the form which concerns the right you wish to exercise. If you want to exercise several rights, fill in all the necessary forms.





In order to exercise the rights, we must verify the identity of the data subject. This is important so that we can be sure to perform the measures to the data of the correct person.
Submit the completed form(s) primarily via the . 




Step-by-step guide

Log in to the Suomi.fi service with your personal online banking codes, a certificate card or a mobile certificate.
Go to Compose a message
Select National Institute for Health and Welfare as the recipient of the message.
Select Registry as the recipients service or issue.
Enter Findata: rights of a data subject as the subject.
List the rights you wish to exercise (you may use the names of the forms) in the message field.
Attach the completed form(s) by clicking Add the attachments here.
Finally, click the Send the message button.




The message is directed to the registry of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, from where it is forwarded to Findata. As a rule, we process requests within one month of receiving them. If the processing of the request is particularly complex for some reason, we may extend the processing time to a maximum of three months.
We will send a reply on the implementation of the request or resolving the matter to the data subject as a Suomi.fi message.
If you are unable to use the Suomi.fi service, you can personally visit the reception of the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki or Kuopio. 

Note that Findata is not the original controller of health and social data. Thus, for example, a request submitted to Findata to object to the use of personal data does not prevent the disclosure of the data for secondary use by one of the controllers referred to in the Secondary Use Act Section 6.

If you have additional questions about exercising your rights, please contact us by email at .






How can I cancel the exercise of my rights?



If desired, a request objecting to the processing of data may be cancelled. This applies to any person who has submitted a data processing objection request. 
A minor on whose behalf the guardians have submitted such a request may also cancel the request themselves if they are assessed as understanding the importance of the matter given their current age and level of development.
If you wish to cancel your request, send a message concerning the request to Findata via the Suomi.fi service or visit personally the reception of the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki or Kuopio.

Findata successfully leads development of Common European Application Forms in HealthData@EU Pilot

2.5.2024

 






Findata led the task of creating common forms for applying electronic health data for secondary use. The development of the forms is part of the HealthData@EU pilot project which is building a pilot version of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) infrastructure for the secondary use of health data.
The forms provide Health Data Access Bodies (HDABs) with all the necessary information to assess whether permission to use the data can be granted. Using the shared form template, users can apply for data from other EU countries as well, and the information can be collected consistently and in compliance with EHDS requirements, says Findatas Chief Specialist, Peija Haaramo.
For the forms to work efficiently, it is crucial that sufficient information is gathered for the processing of the application. However, the forms shouldnt be too burdensome or complicated to fill in and process, Haaramo continues.
The forms are based on the requirements outlined in the EHDS Regulation proposal which was presented by the European Commission in May 2022. They also take into account the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Experience used as a basis for creating the forms
Findatas own application forms served as the basis for the development of the forms, as they have gone through several rounds of iteration and proved to work well during Findatas four years of operation.
When the development process for the forms began, Findata had successfully received and processed more than 860 applications. The practical experience helped us to identify the best practices and the most common pitfalls that can occur, says Sofia Marin, Findatas project officer for HealthData@EU.
The French, Norwegian, Danish and Belgian application forms were also used as a reference when defining the necessary elements for the common European forms.
Collaboration emphasised in the process
Findata welcomed all comments and ideas from project partners throughout the process. It also announced official rounds of comments, ensuring everyone had the opportunity to share their views and suggest improvements. Findata organised several workshops to analyse the questions on the forms.
We analysed the relevance of the questions, their clarity and whether they provided sufficient information for the HDABs. Participants also shared their valuable practical experiences as data users, application processors and legal experts, refining the form accordingly, says Marin.
A comprehensive report was written to accompany the forms, detailing the context of the task, outlining the methodology used to create the forms, explaining each section of questions, and providing a wide range of recommendations for implementation and further development.

FinRegistry dataset collection now available from Findata

25.4.2024

,				 






Findata has published a new ready-made dataset collection consisting of registry data collected in the FinRegistry research project and research data generated from them. Extractions from the material will be tailored for each project.
FinRegistry is a joint research project of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) and the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, which examines register data covering the whole Finnish population. Now the vast majority of the register data used in the study is available directly from Findata.
The material includes data from Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV), Cancer Registry, Finnish Centre for Pensions (ETK), Kanta services, Kela, THL and Statistics Finland. It contains over 20 datasets and covers data from several decades.
A special thank you to the FinRegistry research project for making this possible and for suggesting it. Its great that such a comprehensive dataset collection can be put to wider use, says Peija Haaramo, Chief Specialist at Findata.
The FinRegistry ready-made dataset collection has been developed as part of the FinHITS project co-funded by the European Union.
FinRegistry data is available faster and cheaper
The FinRegistry data differs from the previous Findata COVID-19 ready-made dataset in that it does not have predefined datasets or modules, but the extraction is always tailored to the needs of the applicant. Findata ensures that the principle of minimization is fulfilled and pseudonymises the data.
The process of applying for a data permit that consists of the FinRegistry data is shorter than for a standard data permit, as the feasibility and cost of extracting the data does not need to be separately requested from the data controllers. This also means that the dataset is likely to be available at a lower cost.
We at Findata assess the feasibility and costs of the planned extractions. The dataset can also be used, for example, to select target or control groups for data permits that involve data other than the data in the FinRegistry material, Haaramo says.
The cost of a data permit solely to the FinRegistry dataset collection is 300 euros. For data extraction, a fee based on an hourly rate is charged, which is 147 euros per hour in 2024. If additional data are combined with FinRegistry dataset collection, the price of a standard data permit will apply.
How to apply for the FinRegistry data
You can apply for the FinRegistry data by using the data permit application form in . The use of FinRegistry data to define the target group is also done on the application form.
The required variables need to be listed on the extraction description form in accordance with the data descriptions. Data descriptions can be found in the  in English and Finnish.

The FinHITS kick-off brought together more than a hundred experts to plan for the future of secondary use

10.4.2024

,				 






A wide range of professionals working in the field of secondary use gathered for the FinHITS kick-off event on Friday 5 April 2024. Among the attendees were Findatas customers, data controllers and other secondary use stakeholders such as service providers. The discussions highlighted the importance of collaboration.
The kick-off event of FinHITS was filled with an enthusiastic and collaborative atmosphere, as more than a hundred secondary use experts gathered together to plan future services and discuss the opportunities and challenges of secondary use of social and health data.
It was great to see a room full of people interested in the development of secondary use services and the newest developments of the EHDS, says Satu Sandholm, Project Coordinator of FinHITS.
First we got to hear the latest news on the development of the European Data Space (EHDS) and preliminary interpretations of its relevance for Finland. The participants were given a comprehensive presentation on the FinHITS project co-funded by the European Union, which aims to develop Finnish secondary use services over the next four years.
In the afternoon, a panel discussion brought a variety of perspectives to the table. Aaro Tupasela from the University of Helsinki, Aino Vesikansa from MedEngine, Arto Vuori from Kela, Enni Sanmark from HUS and the University of Helsinki and Johanna Seppnen from Findata shared their views on the strengths and challenges of the Finnish infrastructure and where we are heading with the EHDS.
The day concluded with a recap of the presentations, questions and discussions heard during the event by Jukka Lhesmaa, Senior Specialist at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Short warm-up got the participants ready for the work shop sessions.
Descriptions of available data plays a key role
Participants were able to contribute to service development plans in workshops. The four workshops focused on different themes: data quality, the secure processing environment, Findatas e-service and helpdesk services.
In each workshop, the national data catalogue (Aineistokatalogi) came up as a topic for discussion.
One workshop discussed the possibility of integrating the data catalogue into the application portal, while another workshop came up with the idea of a Mega-catalogue that would also include data other than those covered by the Secondary Use Act and legislation on the use of data. These are exactly the kind of ambitious ideas that we were looking for, says Sandholm.
High-quality and standardised data descriptions were seen as an opportunity to improve data quality, facilitate the processing of data permit applications and reduce the customers need for guidance.



Highlights from the workshops

Data quality

The importance of data harmonisation: making use of data models, standards and machine learning
Channel for communication: a tool to report data quality, shortcomings, possibility for iterative quality improvement

Development of Kapseli processing environment

Adding automation for verifying the anonymity of results
More agile customisation of processing environments and streamlined access management.

Development of Findatas e-service

Structured application where extractions need only be described once
A portal linked to the data catalogue, where the extractions are described based on the data stored in the catalogue

Development of advisory services and an international perspective

Leveraging automation and AI in advice services: automating the start of the advice pathway to refine the information needs, and, if needed, directing the client to advice with clear questions





Tackling challenges with cooperation
Both in the workshops and in the coffee-table discussions, the importance of collaboration was a topic of discussion.
The participants valued the opportunity to connect with others working within the field of secondary use, tells Maari Parkkinen, Development Manager of Findata. Many said that getting to know each other and brainstorming together makes it easier to continue collaborating in the future.
Sandholm agrees that it is essential to take into account different perspectives and make compromises. This will become even more important as the EHDS implementation approaches:
We all face many of the same challenges and it is therefore important that we work together to solve them. Having a unified national vision will also facilitate the implementation of the EHDS.
The next FinHITS event will be a webinar in November, which anyone interested can attend. The collaboration continues during the project, for example in smaller test groups where participants will be able to test the services being developed. Events in English will also be organised.
We would like to thank the participants for their activity! Not only did we get support for our current plans, but also a lot of new ideas that we will continue to develop as the project progresses, says Parkkinen.

Group photo was taken to end the event.

What to remember before sending an application





									Select the correct application type								

 

 


There are different types of applications for different information needs



Data permit application, when you need data on individuals


Data request, when you need statistical data


Amendment application, when you are applying for an amendment to a valid data permit

 







									Describe and limit data								

 

 


Define the data to be applied for at the variable level and remember the principle of minimisation for other information.  and controllers advisory services



Where from and how do I extract the target group? Is the definition specific enough?


Are control subjects/relatives extracted? How will they be defined?


From which registers will the data be extracted?


What variables will be included in the extraction?



Other data to be combined



Have you made sure that the other data is described on the application?


Are the permits for other data valid or is the permit process pending?

 







									Determine the competent authority								

 

 


Findata is responsible for the application and the permit decision whenever dataare combinedfrom data controllers covered by the Act on secondary use of health and social data.The assessment of the competent authority must therefore consider all the data related to the application.

What data use can permits be issued for?
A permit can be issued for the purposes laid down in law, which are listed below. Data on individuals will be sent to a secure operating environment for analysis, while statistical data can be sent to the applicant.
Pursuant to the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data, information can be used without a separate permit also for knowledge management and social welfare and health care official management and supervision.


Individual-level material

scientific research
statistics
education
planning and reporting duties of an authority

In addition, under the Secondary Use Act, controllers can use their own data for knowledge management without permission from Findata.


Statistical data

scientific research
statistics
planning and reporting duties of an authority and/or guidance and supervision of a social and healthcare authority 
education
development and innovation operations

Note that as a rule, the Secondary Use Act applies to register-based studies.
A register-based study is a study which utilises register data usually collected for other purposes or national registers. For example, the Secondary Use Act does not apply to clinical trials reported to Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea or to medical trials under the Medical Research Act.
What data can permits be issued for?
The data you can access via Findata are from social and health sector controllers on which you can find more information on the  page.
Please note that we cannot issue permits for the data of all controllers within the scope of the Secondary Use Act. More details on these data restrictions can be found in the .

Data descriptions and additional information
In accordance with the Secondary Use Act, data controllers provide advisory services concerning their own data and are the best placed to do so. If you need more information on the variables in a certain controllers data, contact the controller in question.
You can also make an agreement on the implementation of data extraction in a certain manner with the controller. In the application you send to us, specify the person with whom you have agreed to on the matter.
The National Data Catalogue at aineistokatalogi.fi contains descriptions of some of the data in the scope of the Secondary Use Act.



Which authority should a permit application be submitted to?
Findata is responsible for the application and the permit decision whenever dataare combinedfrom data controllers covered by the Secondary Use Act. The assessment of the competent authority must therefore consider all the data related to the application.
Submit the application to Findata when it applies to

data from several public social and health sector controllers
data maintained by a single public controller, that has transferred the right to issue permits to Findata




register data from one or numerous private social welfare and health care service organisers, or
customer data saved in the Kanta Services.

Under the law, statistical, aggregated data subject to a data request can only be accessed via Findata.




See the bottom of this page for the application assistant. The assistant can help in determining which authority you should send you data permit or amendment application to.


The rights listed below concerning the issuing of data permits and amendment permits also apply when not permit has been issued to any controllers information. If there is already a valid permit for some of the information, it will then be determined how many controllers have data that the applicant needs to access. In a situation where a permit is only needed for information from one public sector controller, the controller in question will issue the permit.
The Secondary Use Act does not apply to clinical trials reported to Fimea, so these are not within Fimeas competence. The definitions for interventional clinical trial and noninterventional study can be looked up in Finnish at . When necessary, Fimea will provide advice on whether a study is considered a clinical trial.
You can read more on data permit processing related competences in Finnish in section 44 of the 
Under the Secondary Use Act, public sector social and health controller are divided into two groups. Below is the more detailed division of these groups and their differences in competence.


Public sector controllers: Group 1

Regional State Administrative Agencies (AVI)
Social Insurance Institution (Kela)
Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea
National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health Valvira
Public service providers of social welfare and health care
Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (STM)
Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)
Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (TTL)

We are responsible for data permits and amendment permits when the application concerns the information of at least controllers in this group.
This is also applies in a situation where another party could be believed to have already accessed data or to have their own data. If for example, a wellbeing services county needs data from Kela in addition to their own data for a study, the application in this case concerns the data of two controllers. In this case, Findata is the competent authority.
If the application or the data utilisation plan mentions other data under the Secondary Use Act which is to be combined with the data to be retrieved, the application applies to this combined data as well.


Public sector controllers: Group 2

Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV): A persons basic personal data (e.g. birthdate, date of death, personal identity code), family relations, place of residence and building details. If other information is needed, DVV is responsible for processing applications and making permit decisions.
Finnish Centre for Pensions (ETK): Peoples employment and income data, granted benefits and their grounds including diagnoses concerning disability pensions. If other information is needed, the ETK is responsible for processing applications and making permit decisions.
Statistics Finland: Information to help in determining cause of death. If other information is needed, Statistics Finland will be responsible for processing applications and making permit decisions.

We are responsible for the data permits and amendment permits of the Finnish Centre for Pensions, the Digital and Population Data Service Agency and Statistics Finland, if in addition to them the application also concerns

information from one or more public sector controllers in Group 1
information from one or more private social welfare and health care service organisers, or
data saved in the Kanta Services

How to expediate the processing of application
The processing times for applications are affected by the content of the application, in particular, the accuracy of an extraction description, the backlog at Findata and the response times of controllers.
If there are any ambiguities concerning the completion of your application, contact the controller directly and Findatas advisory service to expediate processing.



How to speed up the processing of your application:

Check whether Findata is the competent authority to issue a permit for the data you need. 

Use the  to help in determining this. 
The exceptions to Findatas one-stop shop are the Digital and Population Data Services Agency, the Finnish Centre for Pensions, and Statistics Finland. If you need information from one or several the aforementioned controllers, these controllers are responsible themselves for the processing of applications and making permit decisions. 
If you do not know where you should send an application, contact our advisory service before sending the application:.


Contact controllers directly if you need more information about the data or variables. 

In accordance with the Secondary Use Act, the data controllers provide advisory services concerning their own data and are the best placed to do so. You can also make an agreement on the implementation of data extraction in a certain manner with the controller. 
In the application you send to us, specify the person with whom you have agreed to on the matter.
You can also contact our advisory services or use the .


Describe the information need and the register-specific data extractions as accurately as possible before sending the application.  

If the extraction includes several steps, also describe the order of extraction. Use . 
Incomplete or insufficient descriptions can lead to your application being returned to you.


Make sure that the extractions and the data you want to retrieve is essential

The principle of minimisation as defined in the GDPR is applied to the disclosure of personal data, meaning that only the essential data is disclosed. 
The extraction can be extensive provided that there are good grounds for the necessity of the data.


Complete the applicationcarefully.

Pay attention when entering basic data such as the applicant, the controller for the data to be disclosed, invoicing details and possible other data to be combined.






About the transfer of personal data outside the EU/EEA
The processing of personal data abroad is counted as a transfer of personal data even if the data is in a remote access environment.
Under the EUs General Data Protection Regulation, data can be transferred within the European Economic Area on the same grounds as within Finland. Countries belonging to the European Economic Area include the EU Member States and Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
If data is to be transferred or processed outside the aforementioned countries, i.e. in so-called third countries, there must be a legal basis for this in keeping with Chapter V of the GDPR.
The acceptable legal bases are listed below. It is sufficient that just one of these bases for data transfer is met.





									Commission decision in the adequacy of data protection under Article 45								

 

 






If the requirements for the transfer are met on this basis, no other measures are required, and we will take this criterion into account as a factor justifying the transfer in the data permit decision. This safe country principal is the primary basis for data transfer.


For more information, see .

 







									Standard contractual clauses on data protection pursuant to Article 46(2)								

 

 



Standard contractual clauses (SCC) are standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission that can be used in contracts between two controllers or between a controller and a processor.


These standard clauses can be viewed on .


If this is given as the basis for data transfer, we will take this criterion into account in the data permit decision. We will make the data available outside the EU/EEA subject to this condition and only after the applicant or permit holder has submitted to Findata the signed standard contractual clauses. The use of standard clauses will also require additional examination of the adequacy of data protection. Please note that standard contractual clauses may not be modified or added to, but must be approved as they are.

 







									Binding corporate rules pursuant to Article 47								

 

 



Binding corporate rules (BCR) refer to shared, binding rules for the transfer of personal data to third countries within a corporate group or group of companies engaged in joint economic operations.


For more information, .


If this is given as the basis for data transfer, we will take this criterion into account in the data permit decision. We will make the data available outside the EU/EEA area subject to this condition and only after the applicant or permit holder has notified the Findata of the code of conduct in question, which must have been appropriately approved by a data protection ombudsman of an EU Member State.

 







									Exceptions and safeguards under Article 49								

 

 


Exceptions and safeguards under Article 49, such as the explicit consent of the subject to the proposed transfer after being informed of the risks associated with the transfer.This basis for transfer can only be used in exceptional cases.



For more information, .


When appealing to this legal basis when utilising data subject to a permit, the controller or the processor must describe in their report on processing operations the assessment related to the transfer and the appropriate safeguards established. For more information, .


If this is given as the basis for data transfer, we will take this criterion into account in the data permit decision.

Permit fees and other costs
A fee will be charged for decisions concerning data permit applications, data requests and amendment applications and the related processing of data. The price of our services comprises the price of the decision and an hourly fee, which will be determined according to the working hours spent on combining and processing the data.
In addition to the fees charged by Findata, the final price is affected by the data extraction and delivery fees based ondecrees concerning the controllers.
When we process applications, we will ask the controller for a maximum cost estimate for extracting the necessary data. We will also give a maximum cost estimate on data processing by Findata.
We will forward these estimates to the applicant before making a decision on the permit. The final price of the data resource is confirmed after disclosing the data. A separate processing fee is charged for any expired and negative decisions.
See the  page for more information.






After applying



How does an applications processing proceed?
The processing of applications can be divided into five stages, which can be preceded by the applicant independently contacting to a controller. The process is shown in text after the graph.


The applicant contacts controllers directly before sending an application, if they need additional information on the data or variables or they need help with drawing up an extraction description.

The applicant can also make an agreement on the implementation of data extraction in a certain manner with the controller. If the customer and the controllers contact person have agreed for example that a clinician, who is part of the research team will extract the data free of charge, the applications Additional information section should include information on who this was agreed on with and in what context.


The applicant submits their application or requested additional information to Findata in the electronic application system at .

If the applicant is only submitting additional information, the clarifications can, depending on the case, also be submitted by e-mail.


Our application processors check applications and their appendices to ensure that these contain all the necessary information.

Where necessary, we will return an incomplete application for completion or we will submit a request for further clarification to the applicant.


When all the extraction descriptions have been completed, we will send additional information and cost estimate requests to the controllers whose information is requested in the application.

The purpose of the request is to determine the feasibility of the requested extraction and the maximum cost estimate for the extraction.
According to the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data, the controllers have 15 working days to respond to this request. Where necessary, controllers may ask for additional details to the request, in which case we will forward the questions to the applicant.
At this stage, we will also determine Findatas internal cost estimate, which comprises our own data processing costs.


Once all the cost estimates have been received, the applicant will be presented with a final extraction description and a maximum cost estimate for approval.

The applicant must accept both in order for the permit to be granted.
Note that it will not be possible to change the extraction conditions after this, and that changes made to the extracted data later on will require a separate application.


We at Findata will issue a positive data permit or data request decision.

Note, that data permits are always for a fixed period. If data needs to be saved for a purpose such as the verification of research or the you intend to renew your permit or the extractions must be updated at certain intervals, include these needs in your application.



How will the compilation of the applied for data proceed?
Once we have issued a data permit or made a decision on a data request, there are five different staged for the compilation of data and its pre-processing. The process is shown in text after the graph.


We will send the data requests to the controllers so that extraction can begin. Each controller has 30 working days to submit the requested data to Findata.

Depending on the nature of the project and the extraction, this phase may include several consecutive parts, such as 1. extraction of the target group; 2. extraction of the controls; 3. extraction of data.


We will begin to process the sent data. As agreed on for each project, we will check, combine and pseudonymise the data or make statistics on them in accordance with a data request.
The completed data will be handed over to the permit holder in an agreed-upon secure operating environment. Findatas secure remote operating environment  is the statutory primary option. The data can be disclosed to other operating environments, if this is necessary for the completion of the project.

The target time for the handing over of data is 60 working days. The target time will not be possible if a target group is not given immediately after the decision has been made, data extraction is carried out in several stages, deliveries by data controllers are delayed or the data is exceptionally complex.


The permit holder has three months to review the material. The permit holder must notify Findata within this given time period of any comments they wish to make on the material.

Check the data thoroughly as soon as possible. Errors that occur during extraction can accumulate, if, for example, the target group has been formed incorrectly and other controllers must carry out their own extractions all over again for this reason.


We will remove the data from our own systems four months after it has been handed over. We will retain the code keys for pseudonymised data that will enable the data to be reproduced.

Data permits are always for a fixed period. If data needs to be saved for a purpose such as the verification of research or the you intend to renew your permit or the extractions must be updated at certain intervals, include these needs in your application.



Where can the data be analysed?
The aggregated statistical data accessed via a data request is sent to the customer, and it can be analysed freely in accordance with a data utilisation plan.
Data on individuals that require a data permit can only be analysed in a secure environment.
As a rule, the data will always be disclosed to Findatas secure operating environment . However, the Act on the Openness of Government Activities makes it possible to disclose information to other operating environments, if necessary. Read more below in the section:.
If an individual controller within the scope of the Secondary Use Act has made a decision on a data permit concerning data included in their own registers, they must disclose the data to a secure environment referred to in the Act as well. Amendment permits are also officially data permits (decisions to amend data permits), meaning the same requirements apply to these as to data permits. The exception to this is changes to personal data processors.
Findatas regulation sets information security requirements for environments
We have issued a regulation in accordance with the Secondary Use Act, which describes the requirements laid down other service providers secure operating environments.
The regulation concerns the secondary use of social and health data, and it will be applied to all the purposes provided in the Act for which a data permit is required. These purposes include scientific research, statistics, teaching and the planning and investigation tasks of the authorities. With regard to teaching, the regulation pertains to the preparation of teaching materials, not actual teaching.
As of 1 May 2022, the implementation of the requirements laid down in the regulation is a prerequisite for the disclosure of data to be processed by the permit holder for secondary purposes in an environment other than Findatas secure operating environment Kapseli. In addition, the operating environment must be assessed by a data security assessment body that must issue a certificate on the assessment.
The entry into force of the requirements does not affect existing, valid permits. If data are processed on the basis of a valid permit previously granted, the processing of that data may continue in the same environment after 1 May 2022.
The requirements take into account the solutions in existing environments and enable the utilisation of different technical solutions.
At its simplest, a secure environment can be a physically and technically secure space with a terminal device for analysing data that is isolated from the Internet and other devices. On the other hand, technical solutions based on cloud services are also possible, as long as the service provider ensures the required level of data security. The operating environments of foreign researchers must also meet the data protection and security requirements.
Clinically significant findings
Based on the Section 55 of the Secondary Use Act, a data recipient can contact Findata if they make a clinically significant finding where a health-related risk could be prevented or the quality of their treatment improved. 
Findata establishes who the finding concerns and then submits the information to a specialist at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). THLs appointed specialists assess the significance of the data and the expected benefits of taking action. If the benefit is assessed to be so clear that it would be important for the patient to receive treatment, the information is then disclosed to the wellbeing services county responsible for the patients treatment. An employee of the wellbeing services county contacts the patient.
Everyone has the right to prohibit attempts to contact them based on section 55 of the Secondary Use Act. This prohibition can be set up in any operating unit that provides public health care and also online via My Kanta. Contact prohibitions cannot be set up via Findata, Kela or THL.

Counselling service

We provide advisory services on this website and via email at .
We provide answers to questions concerning such things as the submission of data, data descriptions and general questions concerning the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data


Support for creating data descriptions

Organisations within the scope of the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data in their role as controllers have a statutory obligation to draw up data descriptions on the information content in their information resources in accordance with the Findata Regulation. This is important so that those who need data can assess the suitability of the data for secondary use.
We provide free tools for controllers: Data editor, with which data descriptions can be drawn up and a Data catalogue where data descriptions can be published.
In addition, we help controllers in creating data descriptions by providing training on the use of the aforementioned tools.


Anonymisation service

If the secondary data use application relates to only one public social and health sector controller, that controller is themselves responsible for processing the data permit application and making the permit decision. However, if the data is disclosed to the permit holder in anonymised form, we will anonymise the data on behalf of the controller and deliver it for the permit holders use.


Processing of data permit and amendment applications by the controller

Public controllers may authorise Findata to carry out on their behalf, as detailed in the Secondary Data Act, services other than advice and data description services. In such cases, we also process on behalf of the controller those data permit and amendment applications which relate only to the content of the controllers own registers.
For information on controllers who have transferred their authority to issue permits, see the  page section titled

									Can the data I received via Findata be combined to other information?								

 

 


Data referred to in the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data can be combined to other information, such as data a person has collected themselves or data accessed with some other permit. As a rule, Findata or a statistics authority combines the data.


If you wish to combine data later on to data you have received via Findata, send an amendment application for the data to be combined. For more information please see the .


If you are applying to have data accessed with an individuals consent to be combined with data that Findata has issued a permit for, the research subjects notification and consent models must be attached to the application.

Do not attach permits for other data to the application. The application processor will ask for these separately of necessary.



See the instructions for sending data on the page .
 







									How does the data controller provide the extracted data to Findata?								

 

 


For instructions on how data controllers can submit extracted data, see the .
 







									Can my information be disclosed abroad?								

 

 


Free movement of data within the EU is required under the General Data Protection Regulation. However, the law requires that the data is mainly processed in the centralised, secure user environment of the data permit authority for the social and health care sector, and that access rights to the environment may only be granted to authorised persons. The permit holder may also be located elsewhere than in Finland. The provision of a data secure user environment is an essential technical measure to safeguard the protection of personal data.


If necessary, the data may be disclosed to another secure environment indicated by the permit holder. However, this other environment must meet the criteria of the Findata order, it must be audited against the requirements of the order, and its audit certificate must be valid. Valvira maintains the Toini register, and in these cases also the information should only be used for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the permit holder. The EUs General Data Protection Regulation specifies the conditions under which data can be disclosed outside the EU.


Health and social data may not be used for marketing or the determination of individual commercial services, such as insurance premiums.
 







									Will my data be sold to third parties?								

 

 


No. Findata is the Health and Social Data Permit Authority that grants temporary permits for the secondary processing of social and health care data provided that the statutory permit conditions are met.
 







									How can I prohibit the secondary use of my data?								

 

 


Everyone has the right to their personal data and the right to object to the processing of the data. We have compiled instructions on how to exercise your right of objection on the webpage Data protection and processing of personal data.


It should be noted that Findata is not the original controller of health and social data. Thus, for example, a request submitted to Findata to object to the use of personal data does not prevent the disclosure of the data for secondary use by one of the controllers referred to in the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data (Secondary Use Act), Section 6.


Unfortunately, Finland does not have a centralised system through which the secondary use of data can be banned once and for all in a way that is binding on all parties. 


You can submit a objection request directly to the other actors referred to in Section 6 of the Secondary Use Act: 



social welfare and health care service providers, 


the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, 


the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), 


the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela), 


the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health, 


the Regional State Administrative Agencies, 


the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, 


Fimea, 


Statistics Finland, 


the Central Pension Insurance Institute and 


the Digital and Population Data Services Agency.

 







									What is the difference between primary and secondary use of health and social data?								

 

 


Primary use means the purpose for which the data was originally saved in the customer register and/or patient register. 


The primary purpose may be, for example, 



examination, treatment and rehabilitation of the patient, 


the service received by a social welfare customer, 


or the processing of benefits by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela).



Secondary use means the use of the same data for purposes other than the primary use. 


Legitimate secondary purposes of use include 



scientific research, 


statistics, 


development and innovation activities, 


education, 


knowledge management, 


steering and supervision by authorities and 


the planning and reporting duty of an authority.



Different purposes of use are subject to different regulations. Only aggregated statistics from which individuals cannot be identified may be obtained for development and innovation activities.
 







									Can I collect the data myself from my own hospital and thus avoid the data controllers collection fee?								

 

 


Yes, you can, if this is okay with the controller. The controller has the right to determine independently the manner in which it carries out the extraction, and it has the right to use an external processor to carry out the data extraction.


If such processors are used, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that a data protection agreement (DPA) covering the processing of personal data is signed with them. The controller is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the personal data is processed in a legal manner. The processor, meanwhile, is responsible for ensuring that it complies with the terms of the DPA and the instructions of the controller.


The collected data must be delivered to Findata securely via the transfer service Nextcloud, after which we combine and pre-process them.
 







									Do the collection fees charged by the controllers include VAT?								

 

 


This depends on the controller. The data controllers determine their own collection fees on the basis of their own regulations.
 







									Why is the VAT rate 0% for some payments and 24% for others?								

 

 


Findatas prices are based on the decree of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health on charges for work carried out by the Health and Social Data Permit Authority.


With the exception of Kapseli, the service prices are for actions under public law that are based on cost value (VAT 0 %). The prices for Kapselis services are commercially priced paid services with 24% VAT.


The data controllers determine their own costs on the basis of their own regulations.
 







									On average, how much are Findatas data processing charges?								

 

 


On the page  (in Finnish), you can find the average, range and median calculated from the maximum cost estimates. The data is updated quarterly.
 







									What are the average collection fees for data controllers?								

 

 


You can find the average, the range and the median calculated from the maximum cost estimates for data extractions in Finnish on the . We update the data quarterly.
 







									Can someone other than the permit holder receive the invoices?								

 

 


Possibly. Any inconsistencies between the applicant and the invoiced party (e.g. the payer is not the applicant) can be clarified where necessary in the Additional information section.
 







									Can I receive a paper invoice?								

 

 


E-invoicing is the primary invoicing method. Paper invoices are only possible in exceptional cases. As a rule, however, the invoice recipient are organisations that only accept e-invoices. If necessary, ask for more information from your organisations financial department.

Our Privacy Policy





On this page you will find information about how we process personal data, how you can exercise your data protection rights, what personal data we collect and what the processing of personal data is based on.
Findata becomes a controller of personal data when we receive data from the original data controllers. We process personal data as a data controller when we process applications, provide services that are part of our duties, and carry out our communications. We process contact information of applicants or applicant entities and Kapseli users to send customer notices related to the services and their use.
We do not disclose personal data on the rights, interests or obligations of an individual for decision-making purposes. We do not disclose information, for example, insurance companies for the purpose of preparing individual insurance decisions or to the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) for benefit decisions. In addition, we do not disclose data for marketing or to provide commercial services.
Compliance with data protection legislation in Finland is monitored by .





									What are the laws on which Findata bases the processing of personal data?								

 

 


Findatas legal basis for processing personal data are:



Article 6, (1)(e) of the EUs General Data Protection Regulation: processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller


Article 4(1)(2) of the Data Protection Act: processing of data that is provided for by the law or that is directly attributable to the controller for the task prescribed by the law



We also process data belonging to special categories of personal data, formerly known as sensitive data. Such data includes, for example, a persons health data.


The grounds for processing this kind of personal data are:



Article 9(2)(g) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation: processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or the exercise of public authority


Section 6(1)(2) of the Data Protection Act: processing is necessary and proportionate for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest by a public authority

 




More detailed criteria for processing activity-specific personal data can be found in the privacy notices on this page.

Privacy notices
The list of privacy notices is not comprehensive. We will complete the listing in early 2024.





									Pre-processing of data under data permit								

 

 


Purpose of use


We issue permits for the secondary use of social and health data when the application applies to 



data from numerous public social and health sector controllers


data maintained by a single public controller, that has transferred the right to issue permits to Findata






register data from one or numerous private social welfare and health care service organisers, or


customer data saved in the Kanta Services.



Data permits can be issued for the purposes of



scientific research


statistics


education


planning and reporting duties of an authority



Once the data permit has been issued, we combine and pre-process the data and transfer the pre-processed data to the data recipient for the purpose described in the permit. 


Pre-processing refers to the actions that are taken on data disclosed to Findata by different controllers before we hand it over to the data recipient. In pre-processing, we aggregate, combine, pseudonymise, and anonymise data. 


In principle, we pseudonymise the data before handing it over. Pseudonymisation refers to the processing of data so that it cannot be directly linked to individuals. We disclose information in an identifiable form only for a particularly justified and necessary reason.


We store the identifiers of pseudonymised data securely. We store the identifiers in a way that the data can be made identifiable and the same data can be produced again with the help of identifiers.


The purpose of the pre-processing of personal data is to create data sets in accordance with the issued permit from the data controllers referred to in the Secondary Use Act.


We do not use automated decision-making or profiling in the processing of data.


Data processed and data sources


Each data permit specifies which data can be processed based on it.


In the pre-processing of data permit, we process the social and health data from controllers within the scope of the data permit to the extent that they have been estimated to be necessary for each project. We store identifiers that allow us to identify the individuals whose data has been processed in the projects.


We do not issue permits for all materials of all data controllers that are subject to the Secondary Use Act. For more detailed restrictions on data, see .


Data controllers within the scope of the Secondary Use Act:



Data saved in Kanta services


Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV)


Finnish Centre for Pensions (ETK)


Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)


Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (TTL)


Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea


National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health Valvira


Public and private service providers of social welfare and health care


Social Insurance Institution of Finland Kela


Statistics Finland


Regional state administrative agencies (AVI)



The data is transferred to Findata and on to the data recipient via a secure transfer service.





Regular disclosure of data


We disclose the material formed on the basis of the data permit to the data recipient. The recipient then becomes the controller of the transferred data.


According to the Secondary Use Act, the data can only be disclosed for processing in a secure operating environment.





Recipients of personal data


We will disclose the pre-processed data to the data recipient. In the vast majority of data permits we grant, the recipients use the data for scientific research.


We use Tieteen Tietotekniikkakeskus Oy (CSC) to carry out the technical maintenance and development of the information system (Viranomaisen tietoturvallinen kyttymprist) we use in pre-processing. CSC acts as a processor of personal data on behalf of Findata.


Data retention period


We will retain the data obtained from data controllers and the material formed in the pre-processing for four months after we have disclosed the data to the data recipient. During the retention period, we use the data to correct any possible errors made in the pre-processing of the material.


In the case of a rolling data permit, i.e. a data permit that entitles the data recipient to receive updates to the data, the latest data is retained until the new is formed. If the formation of new data set is based on all previously submitted material, we will retain all material for the duration of the permit.


It should be noted that the data recipient retains the data longer than Findata. The permit specifies its period of validity. The controller of the processing is defined in the data permit.


We retain the identifiers of pseudonymised materials for as long as it is necessary to carry out the research and to ensure the validity of its results, in principle for 12 years.


Transfer and disclosure of personal data to non-EU or EEA countries


As a rule, we do not disclose personal data outside the EU or EEA or to international organisations. According to the Secondary Use act, the data must be transferred to a secure operating environment that cannot be located outside the EU and EEA. If we in a specified individual case transfer personal data outside the EU and EEA or to an international organisation on the basis of another law, we will use the transfer basis chosen in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), depending on the country and organisation of destination.


If the data recipient as the controller wishes to enable the processing of their data from outside the EU and EEA, they must apply to Findata for permission to allow the processing. If we grant permission, the controller must ensure that the material is transferred in accordance with Chapter V of the GDPR, when applicable.


Rights of the data subject


The data subject refers to the person to whom the original social and health information relate. When we process personal data as a data controller, the data subject has the following rights:



Right to information about the processing of personal data (Article 14 of the GDPR)


Right of access to ones personal data (Article 15 of the GDPR)


Right to rectify ones data (Article 16 of the GDPR)


Right to restrict the processing of ones data (Article 18 of the GDPR)


Right to object to the processing of ones data (Article 21 of the GDPR)



The data subject has the right to object to the processing of personal data by us at any time on grounds relating to their particular situation. In this case, we shall no longer process the data relating to this person, unless there are substantial and legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.





Legal basis of processing personal data


The processing of personal data in the pre-processing of data under a data permit is based on the following laws:



Act on the Secondary Use of Social and Health Data, Sections 14, 44, and 51,


Data Protection Act, Section 4(2), and


in the case of special categories of personal data, Data Protection Act, Section 6(1)(2), and General Data Protection Regulation, Article 9(2)(g).

 







									Pre-processing of data under data request								

 

 


Purpose of use


You can obtain statistical data from data controllers covered by the Secondary Use Act with a data request. Once we have made a positive data request decision, we combine and pre-process the data needed for the project and hand over the statistical-level data to the data recipient.


Data requests can be issued for the purposes of



scientific research


statistics


planning and reporting duties of an authority and/or guidance and supervision of a social and healthcare authority


education


development and innovation operations


knowledge management (comparative data)



The purpose of the processing of personal data is to form statistical data of the social and health data received from one or more controllers under the scope of the Secondary Use Act. We provide only anonymous statistical data on the basis of a data request.


In statistical-level data, individual personal data have been combined and summarized. The statistics describe groups of persons rather than an individual persons. The data of the groups of persons is formed in such a way that individuals cannot be identified or traced.


We do not use automated decision-making or profiling in the processing of data.


Data processed and data sources


Each data request decision specifies the basis on which the statistics are to be compiled.


In the pre-processing of data under data requests, we process the social and health data received from one or more controllers under the scope of the Secondary Use Act to the extent that it has been assessed to be necessary for each project.


We do not compile statistics on all materials of all data controllers within the scope of the Secondary Use Act. For more detailed restrictions on data, see.

Regular disclosure of data and recipients of personal data


We disclose only statistical level data based on data requests. We do not disclose personal data.


We use Tieteen Tietotekniikkakeskus Oy (CSC) to carry out the technical maintenance and development of the information systems we use to transfer the data and compile the statistics. CSC acts as a processor of personal data on behalf of Findata.


There are no other categories of recipients of personal data because we do not disclose personal data based on data requests.


Data retention period


We retain data from controllers for a period of six months after we have disclosed the statistics we have compiled to the data recipient. During the retention period, we use the data to correct any possible errors in the compilation of statistics.


In the case of a rolling data request, i.e. statistics are compiled and delivered at regular intervals on the basis of updated data, we will retain the data for six months from the last delivery.


Transfer and disclosure of personal data to non-EU or EEA countries


We do not disclose personal data outside the EU or EEA.


The statistics compiled on the basis of the data request do not contain personal data, so they can also be disclosed outside the EU member states.


Rights of the data subject


The data subject refers to the person to whom the original social and health information relate. When we process personal data as a data controller, the data subject has the following rights:

in the case of special categories of personal data, the Data Protection Act Section 6(1)(2) and the General Data Protection Regulation Article 9(2)(g).

 







									Processing of data permit applications and data requests								

 

 


Purpose of use


Findatas statutory duties include processing data permit applications and data requests and issuing administrative decisions on them. We accept data permit applications and data requests through Findatas data request management system.


We process personal data relating to applicants or representatives of applicant organisations for the purposes of processing applications, decision-making and invoicing. We process contact information of applicants or applicant entities to send customer notices related to the services and their use.


In principle, the applicants must identify themselves using the Suomi.fi service when applying for a data permit or a data request.


Data permit applications, data requests and the decisions on them are stored in the case management system in accordance with the authoritys data management regulation. The case management system used by Findata is maintained by the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).


Draft applications are stored in the case management system so that the applicant can, if necessary, pause the drafting of the application and return to it at a later date.


We do not use automated decision-making or profiling in our data processing.


Data processed and data sources


We collect the information about those applying for data permits and data requests that they provide in the application or request.This information includes the name, position or title of the applicant or their contact person, contact details and the name and affiliation of the persons entitled to process personal data. We also process data for billing purposes. If the data recipient is a private individual, the billing information also includes personal data. In addition, the application may include the name and contact information of the person delivering the target group to Findata.


In addition, we maintain a log system that allows us to track and store personal data from the various stages of processing data permit applications and data requests.


When an application for a data permit or data request is submitted, we store the personal data required for strong electronic identification of the applicant that is transmitted by the Suomi.fi service. .


We record applications for data permits and data requests in the case management system Helmi maintained by THL. 


Regular disclosure of data and recipients of personal data


We do not disclose the personal data provided in data permit applications or data requests on a regular basis. We publish information on data permits and data requests that we have issued. If the data recipient is a private individual, we do not publish their name.


We disclose information to those requesting it in accordance with the Act on the Openness of Government Activities. As a rule, the information on the application for a permit and the person who made the data request is public, as it is not explicitly provided for to be kept secret.


We use Tieteen Tietotekniikkakeskus Oy (CSC) to carry out the technical maintenance and development work of the data request management system. CSC acts as a processor of personal data on behalf of Findata.


We record data permit applications and data requests in the case management system maintained by THL. Persons working at THL whose duties include processing Findatas documents have access to the data. Findata is an independent unit operating in connection with THL.


Data retention period


We retain data permit applications permanently, and data requests for a period of ten years from their initiation. We retain the data permit decisions permanently and the data request decisions for a period of ten years from the date of their issuance.


We retain draft applications and data requests that have not been submitted to Findata for 180 days from the last edit. Applications that have not been modified for 180 days will be automatically removed from the system.


Transfer and disclosure of personal data to non-EU or EEA countries


We do not disclose personal data outside the EU or EEA.


Rights of the data subject


The data subject refers to the person to whom the original social and health information relate. When we process personal data contained in an application for data permit or a data request, the data subject has the following rights:



Right to information about the processing of personal data (Article 14 of the GDPR)


Right of access to ones personal data (Article 15 of the GDPR)


Right to rectify ones data (Article 16 of the GDPR)


Right to restrict the processing of ones data (Article 18 of the GDPR)


Right to object to the processing of ones data (Article 21 of the GDPR)



The data subject has the right to object to the processing of personal data by us at any time on grounds relating to their particular situation. In this case, we shall no longer process the data relating to this person, unless there are substantial and legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.





Legal basis of processing personal data


The processing of personal data for processing data permit and data request applications is based on the following laws:



Act on the Secondary Use of Social and Health Data (552/2019) Sections 44 and 45, 


General Data Protection Regulation Article 6(1)(e) and 


Data Protection Act Section 4(2).

 







									Ready-made datasets								

 

 


Purpose of use


We offer thematic datasets which are pre-compiled and processed data entities. The ready-made datasets are available through Findata more quickly on the basis of a data permit, without having to request cost estimates or extracts from the controllers.


Pre-processing refers to the actions that are taken on data disclosed to Findata by different controllers before we deliver it to the data recipient. Pre-processing includes aggregating, combining, pseudonymising, and anonymising data.


Pseudonymisation refers to the conversion of personal data into a encrypted form. In this case, names and personal identification numbers may be removed and replaced with another unique identifier, i.e. a code. Often, a code key is retained in order to return direct personal information to the data. Pseudonymised data is still personal data. In principle, we pseudonymise the data before handing it over. We will only disclose information in identifiable form for a particularly justified and necessary reason.


Anonymising means changing personal data to make it irreversibly impossible to identify an individual. This can mean, for example, removing direct identifiers and the coarsening the data to a general level so that personal data cannot be changed back to be identifiable in any way.


Findata selects the subject matter of the ready-made data sets and the data on which they are based. The purpose of the processing of personal data is to compile datasets in accordance with the chosen theme and, as a general rule, to disclose pseudonymised personal data or statistics compiled from ready-made datasets to the data recipient.


We do not use automated decision-making or profiling in the processing of data.


Data processed and data sources


In compiling the ready-made datasets, we process the social and health data received from one or more controllers under the scope of the Secondary Use Act to the extent deemed necessary for each project.


We cannot form ready-made material on the basis of all materials of all controllers within the scope of the law. For more detailed restrictions on data, see.

Data retention period


We define the retention period for each ready-made dataset separately.


In addition, the data recipient who has obtained the ready-made dataset on the basis of the data permit retains the data for a specified period of time. The controller of this processing is the data recipient.


Transfer and disclosure of personal data to non-EU or EEA countries


As a rule, we do not disclose ready-made datasets outside the EU or EEA or to international organisations. According to the Secondary Use act, personal data must be transferred to a secure operating environment that cannot be located outside the EU and EEA.


If the data recipient as the controller wishes to enable the processing of their data from outside the EU and EEA, they must apply to Findata for permission to allow the processing. If we grant permission, the controller must ensure that the material is transferred in accordance with Chapter V of the GDPR, when applicable.

Legal basis of processing personal data


The processing of personal data in the formation of ready-made datasets is based on the following laws:



Act on Secondary Use of Social and Health Data (552/2019) Sections 14 and 51, 


General Data Protection Regulation Article 6(1)(e), 


Data Protection Act Section 4(2) and, 


in the case of special categories of personal data, the Data Protection Act Section 6(1)(2) and the General Data Protection Regulation Article 9(2)(g).

 







									Ordering and using Kapseli								

 

 


Purpose of use


Kapseli is a secure operating environment provided by Findata, where you can process individual level data obtained under a data permit issued by Findata or another authority. Kapseli is used via a remote connection by logging in via a browser.


The controller for the processing of material in Kapseli is defined in the data permit. In this case, Findata acts as a data processor on behalf of that controller. 


We process the personal data of Kapseli users as a data controller in order to 



provide the functions of Kapseli,


ensure information security and the lawfulness of the processing of personal data and


carry out billing.



We process contact information of Kapseli users to send user notices related to Kapseli and its use.


We also use the number of Kapseli users to develop and administer the service.


We do not use automated decision making or profiling in our data processing.


Data processed and data sources


When ordering Kapseli, we collect the following information about the person ordering Kapseli:



name


telephone number


email address 


organisation information

Purpose of use


Everyone has the possibility to exercise their rights as a data subject in Findatas operations. The data subject refers to the person to whom the original social and health information relate.

In order to be able to carry out a request for the data subjects right, we need to process the personal data provided in connection with the request.





Data processed and data sources


We collect the following information about the persons who have made requests to exercise the rights of the data subject:



name 


social security number


contact information



In addition, we collect data depending on which right the data subject wishes to exercise.


For individuals who exercise their right to restrict or object to the processing of their data (Articles 18 and 21 of the GDPR), we will record, in addition to the information above, the reasons for restricting or objecting to the use of the data. 


We implement the right to restrict and object on the basis of social security numbers. We remove the data of individuals who have exercised the right to object or restrict from the data we receive by comparing the data with the social security number and removing the detailed information contained in the data relating to those individuals.


In addition to the above, the following data from the data subject are collected from a person exercising their right to rectification (Article 16 of the GDPR):



which data is to be corrected 


to which format the data is to be corrected



Regular disclosure of data and recipients of data


Requests concerning the rights of the data subject are recorded in the case management system maintained by the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). Persons working at THLs registry, whose duties include registering and handling matters initiated at Findata, have access to the information contained in the initiation documents. Findata is an independent unit operating in connection with THL.


We disclose information to those requesting it in accordance with the . The contents of requests for the rights of the data subject may contain confidential information that will not be disclosed without the separately provided right of access or the consent of the data subject.


The contents of requests for the rights of the data subject are not regularly disclosed.


When anonymous statistical information is requested from Findata, which is formed on the basis of data held by THL, THL forms the statistics requested. In this case, we ask THL to exclude from the compilation of the statistics the information relating to the social security numbers of the individuals who have exercised their right to restrict and object to the processing of their data. For this purpose, we transfer to THL the social security numbers of these individuals via a secure transfer service.


The purpose of this policy is to minimize the number of times the social security numbers are transferred between Findata and THL, and to ensure that the data of persons who have exercised the right to object and restrict is excluded from the formation of the data as early as possible.
