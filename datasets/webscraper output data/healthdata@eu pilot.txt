 MenuHealthData@EU PilotWatch video introducing the HealthData@EU Pilot project:
BackgroundIn 2018, The European Commission published a  on enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market, empowering citizens and building a healthier society. It outlined three priorities, including better data to advance research, disease prevention and personalised health and care allowing researchers and other professionals to pool resources through shared European data infrastructures across the EU. At the same time, the European Council promotes adaptation of e-Health infrastructures to facilitate accumulation, exchange and use of health data. In 2020, the European Council set up a Joint Action under the 2020 Work Programme of the 3rd programme for EU action in the field of health ().  supports a key objective of the EU, which is ensuring the seamless flow of health data in the context of the Single Market. It engages key actors of the process, Member States and other participating countries to draft options on the secondary use of health data and to propose options for governance models for data-sharing at EU level, in particular networking for secondary use.To promote digital transformation and widen the use of health data, the European Commission (EC) has made the creation of a European Health Data Space (EHDS) a  . On 24 March 2021, the EU4Health Regulation established the EU4Health Programme that will enable instruments and solutions to support Member States in building stronger, more resilient and accessible health systems. In order to support the development of a common European Health Data Space, the EU4Health Programme launched the EU4H-2021-PJ-06  Action grants for developing a EHDS2 Pilot for an EU infrastructure ecosystem for the secondary use of health data for research, innovation, policy making and regulatory purposes.
Secondary use of health data corresponds to using health data from population-level sources such as electronic health records, health insurance claims data or health registry data to improve personal care planning, medicines development, safety monitoring, research, and policymaking.In July 2022 the European Commission announced its decision to choose the consortium led by the French Health Data Hub to set up a pilot project for the European Health Data Space.The aim of the pilot is to investigate and establish the value of such an infrastructure for the reuse of health data and assess the ability to scale towards a Union-wide infrastructure, as a core component of the European Health Data Space. To do so, the HealthData@EU Pilot project will bring together key actors of secondary use of data in Europe, such as existing health data authorisation bodies or access authorities (i.e. national authorities empowered by national mandate and legal basis to enable access to health data) and other international or EU-level organisations (e.g., research infrastructures, European health related agencies, associations). Those actors will build solutions for operating secondary use at an EU level (common rules, means and procedures) and implement them by building an EU network infrastructure between data providers (nodes) for the secondary use of health data.

IntroductionThe HealthData@EU Pilot project will connect data platforms in a network infrastructure and develop services supporting the user journey for research projects using health data from various EU Member States. It will also provide guidelines for data standards, data quality, data security and data transfer to support this cross-border infrastructure.The HealthData@EU Pilot projectwill be designing, developing, deploying and operating a network of nodes (representing different data brokers, holders and data consumers) federated by central services that may be provided jointly with the European Commission. The aim of the pilot is to investigate and establish the value of such an infrastructure for the reuse of health data and assess the ability to scale towards a Union-wide infrastructure, as a core component of the European Health Data Space. To do so, the HealthData@EU Pilot project will bring together key actors of secondary use of data in Europe, such as existing health data authorisation bodies or access authorities (i.e. national authorities empowered by national mandate and legal basis to enable access to health data) and other international or EU-level organisations (e.g., research infrastructures, European health related agencies, associations). Those actors will build solutions for operating secondary use at an EU level (common rules, means and procedures) and implement them by building an EU network infrastructure between data providers (nodes) for the secondary use of health data.The consortium will also collaborate closely with the European Commission and their team working on developing the central services for HealhData@EU Pilot.In short, the HealthData@EU Pilot project is an EU-funded project and will build a pilot version the European Health Data Space (EHDS) infrastructure for the secondary use of health data which will serve research, innovation, policy making and regulatory proposes. The project will connect data platforms in a network infrastructure and develop services supporting the user journey for research projects using health data from various EU Member States. It will also provide guidelines for data standards, data quality, data security and data transfer to support this cross-border infrastructure. Priority services include a metadata discovery discovery service and a common health data access request.
Aims
Develop and deploy an IT infrastructure for setting up a network of nodes and delivering basic central services jointly with the European Commission, such as common data discovery, common data access application, and allowing data usage (and possibly data transfer).The general objective of our HealthData@EU Pilot project is two-fold:
Run use cases to prove:the value of a Union-wide infrastructure and data ecosystem for the reuse of health data by testing this new infrastructure and evaluating its benefits; andthe potential of cross-country reuse of health data for research, innovation, policy-making, regulatory activities. To that end, the EHDS2@EU Pilot will develop, explore, and analyse standards on data governance, data quality and data infrastructure for data-sharing between different participating countries across Europe.
Use casesIn order to illustrate the feasibility and the potential of reusing data from several European countries, the project will run five use cases that encompass a wide range of research and policy topics.Based on this experiment, the HealthData@EU Pilot will provide complete evaluation of the project and build recommendations for the European Commission about data standards, legal requirements, costs and economic model needed to scale up the tested network.

This was theopportunity to present and discuss the progress of the pilot project testing a first implementation of the European health data space for the secondary use of health data.The event took place on 19 October 2023, 9h30  12h30 (UTC+2), as a hybrid event at PariSant Campus, Paris, France and online, and gathered more than 300 participants.Key Insights into the HealthData@EU pilot projectThe first session was dedicated to Health Data@EU Pilot Project Progress. Irene ZITTLAU and Lionel GRONDIN provided a glimpse into the first achievement of WP5. The projects core objective is to establish a robust IT network infrastructure that streamlines data sharing. Substantial progress has been made in the realms of data discovery and data permits. The project is now in the final stages of preparing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Pascal DERYCKE and Truls KORSGAARD delved into the need for a unified language for health data. Their vision is to enhance data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability following the FAIR data principles. To this end, they advocate for the use of DCAT-AP, and the creation of an extension for health data.As highlighted by Irene SCHLNDER, the HealthData@EU pilot also aims to study and compare the regulatory and ethical intricacies surrounding health data access within EU Member States, research infrastructures and European Agencies. By identifying best practices and harmonizing legal and ethical standards, WP7 aims to establish a common ground essential for the EHDSs success.Finally, Petr HOLUB shed light on the critical work of WP8, whose goal is to ensure data exchange standards, controlled vocabularies, and ontologies align with EHDS requirements. They are also actively seeking feedback from multiple sources to ensure that data is shared efficiently and securely, while also maintaining high data quality.Learning from Cross-Border Use CasesThe event also featured a panel discussion with key participants representing diverse areas of healthcare research and policy, including Anna-Leena VUORINEN, Senior Scientist at the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland; Daniel MORALES, Senior Expert in Epidemiology at EMA; Luis Alves de Sousa, Expert in General Surveillance and eHealth at ECDC; Charles-Andrew VANDE CATSYNE, Scientist at Sciensano; and Juan ARENAS, Head of Project Management Unit at ELIXIR. They shared their experiences from various fields, discussing challenges in areas like cardiometabolic diseases, COVID-19 thrombosis, infectious disease surveillance, COVID-19 testing, vaccination, and colorectal cancer. These experts discussed how lessons learned and barriers the EHDS can help overcome, including AIs role, standards, antimicrobial resistance, handling data from multiple sources, and showcasing research infrastructures value. These discussions offered invaluable insights into the future of healthcare and how EHDS can drive progress.Unlocking Synergies and Opportunities for the Pilot Project in EuropeThe closing panel explored the synergies between the pilot project and other European initiatives. The conversation emphasized the need to connect with ongoing work in Europe, promoting collaboration to address health data challenges in the region.Ander ELUSTONDO JAUREGUI, Policy officer at the European Commission, emphasized the importance of aligning and connecting various projects to maximize their collective impact. The discussion also covered, with an intervention from Markus KALLIOLA, Project Director at Sitra, the timeline and focus of TEHDAS2, highlighting the drafting of guidelines and technical specifications to support the effective implementation of the EHDS. Inclusivity and openness were emphasized, with plans to open each output of the project to public consultations. Petr HOLUB adressed the critical role of European Research Infrastructures in EHDS-related projects. He also stressed the need to simplify data governance. Additionally, the panel explored the opportunities EHDS brings to European Agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), enhancing its ability to make informed and timely decisions and ensure a safer and more efficient healthcare landscape in Europe.Finally, RWD, commonly understood as Real-World Data, was succinctly redefined by Denise Uhumire, Epidemiology/RWE specialist at EMA with just three words: Rapid, Wide, Deep.These insights reflect the collaborative spirit driving the EHDS initiative, with a shared vision of a more interconnected and data-driven healthcare future in Europe among the European Commission, Member States European Research Infrastructure, and European Agencies.Detailed programme Replay of the introduction and first session on the project first results and next steps available Replay of the closing panel Work ahead and interaction with other EU projects available .
