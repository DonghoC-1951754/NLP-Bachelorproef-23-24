Vision
 Virtual Human Twin (VHT) is an integrated multiscale, multi-time, and multi-discipline representation of quantitative human physiology and pathology. Its realisation through a collaborative distributed knowledge and resource platform is specifically designed to accelerate the development, integration, and adoption of patient-specific predictive computer models, which will be used as clinical decision support systems, for personal health forecasting or as methodologies for the development and de-risking of personalised medical products. The vision of EDITH is to facilitate the realisation of the opportunities presented by VHTs for the benefit of patients, healthcare providers, regulatory bodies and industry, both within Europe and globally.

Focus
 A Virtual Human Twin (VHT) is a patient-specific virtual representation of real-world systems or processes, that is built on data-driven or knowledge-driven - most often a combination of both - predictive computer models, and that can be used as a clinical decision-support system, a personal health forecasting tool or as a tool for the development and personalisation of medical products. The focus of EDITH is to propose how a fully integrated VHT can be developed, starting from single organ digital twins.
				











Objectives




ECOSYSTEM
EDITH has the objective to frame an inclusive ecosystem of digital twins in healthcare within the EU Member States and associated countries. It will start with a comprehensive mapping of the existing relevant actors, initiatives, resources (i.e., models, data sets, methods, good practices, infrastructures, solutions, services), and barriers in the digital twins. This will ensure adequate clinical representation, while fostering collaboration and integration of all relevant stakeholders, such as solution developers, technology providers, infrastructure providers, end-users (healthcare professionals and patients), regulatory agencies, and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies.





ROADMAP
EDITH has the objective to build a roadmap with all the necessary conditions to evolve towards an integrated Virtual Human Twin (VHT). The roadmap will identify the necessary building blocks to ensure the VHTs clinical application and formulate clear short- and mid-term policy recommendations. It will also address aspects of interoperability, computability, health information integration from various sources. It will identify any possible implementation needs and barriers, including the development of a strategic approach for clinical deployment of the VHT model. This will foster the uptake of personalised clinical decision-making, with a particular focus on areas of unmet medical needs.


 




REPOSITORY
EDITH has the objective to develop a federated and cloud-based repository of digital twins (data, models, algorithms, and good practices) in healthcare. The repository will provide a virtual collaboration environment for multiple users and organisations, that will pool together existing digital twin resources across Europe. The ecosystem will be leveraged to create a repository catalogue with available resources and recruit resources into the repository from the consortium and external contributors. Through a federated approach, links will be established with ongoing initiatives that have complementary objectives.





SIMULATION PLATFORM
EDITH has the objective to develop the architecture of a simulation platform that will support the transition towards an integrated Virtual Human Twin (VHT). EDITHs platform, based on a personal user account with specific permissions, will outline how to provide users with a one-stop shop to design, develop, test, and validate single organ digital twins, and combine them with other twins to build integrated VHT models. Five use-cases (cancer, cardiovascular, intensive care, osteoporosis, brain) have been pre-selected to be developed as prototypes, representing the variety of functionalities to be provided by the platform.

Implementation




Timeline & Achievements





 


Use Cases

Five use-cases (related to specific applications in cancer, cardiovascular, intensive care, osteoporosis, and brain) have been preselected for early prototyping of the simulation platform, thus allowing EDITH to start working on tangible examples of existing virtual twins. Most of the selected use-cases are currently being tested in a clinical setting in one or more institutions in Europe. EDITH partners responsible for the use-cases represent both technical developers and clinical users. These use-cases cover all the relevant elements of the platform: model types (multi-scale, multi-physics mechanistic models, data-driven models), dataset types (omics, images) and sizes, computational demands (High Performance Computing, cloud), access demands (multiple different users, real-time), possibilities for integration (linking resources across different scales and different application domains), and links to existing repositories. In addition, the , implements the InvestigationsStudiesAssays (ISA) structure and it is a well-suited service to bridge between EDITHs repository and the simulation platform.
		




Cancer





Cancer care has been identified as one of the major disease areas that will benefit from the European Digital Strategy (EDS). The use case is provided by EDITHs partner , from their prior work in the  project. Their in silico model is based on single-cell sequencing data from patients and quantifies the patient-specific molecular and cellular features that represent real tumours to propose personalised drug treatments. This model will be complemented by the EDITH consortium through microscopy imaging and spatial omics techniques to assess the ability to obtain in silico solutions that recapitulate the main anatomical features of the observed tumours. EDITH will integrate the entire workflow to deliver personalised health forecasts.
				      	






Cardiovascular





Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the EU. They are also an area where multiple digital resources are already available. Atrial fibrillation is the most common form of cardiac arrhythmia, affecting over 37 million people worldwide. Virtual cohorts that capture variability in atrial anatomy, fibrotic remodelling, and electrical properties are already under investigation and may be used to simulate the effects of different treatment approaches. Atrial fibrillation has a higher incidence in cancer patients. The underlying mechanisms of this association are currently unclear and virtual twins could form an ideal framework for their investigation. Integration of the respective resources and cardiac modelling workflows will be tested by EDITH ( and ) as a proof-of-concept towards creation of Virtual Human Twins (VHTs). EDITH will provide a pathway to in silico personalised treatment planning. 
				      	






Intensive care





Intensive care is suffering from increasing demographic and economic pressure worldwide. Patient heterogeneity and metabolic variability are high in critically ill patients, showing the need for personalised solutions to provide safe and effective care for all. Virtual twins based on identifiable and relevant patient-specific, time-varying physiological parameters can be used to design decision support systems to guide healthcare professionals. EDITHs partner  is currently co-developing a personalised, risk-based treatment approach providing safe and effective glycaemic control, which is associated with improved survival and recovery in critically ill patients. The computational demands of this model are small, but a challenging real-time interaction between sensors, models, and healthcare professionals is required.
				      	






Osteoporosis





Osteoporosis is one of the major causes of mortality among the elderly. With the EU's ageing population, adequate prediction of osteoporosis-related fracture risk is important. The Bologna Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BBCT) is a virtual twin methodology developed by EDITHs partner . It is a mechanistic model that uses a subject-specific finite element model to predict femoral bone strength. Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) scans of the hip region and patient data will inform a patient-specific computer model, which will, in turn, predict the risk of hip fracture. This will be a single-organ model, generated from data at the time of CT acquisition, and eventually lead to a personalised health forecast.
				      	






Brain





					      	The human brain can be conceptualised as a complex system organised at different spatial scales. The estimated number of neurons is 86 billion, whereby each neuron can have approximately 10.000 synapses. EDITHs partner  has developed BigBrain, a 3D anatomical model. BigBrain is being used to provide high resolution anatomical data for brain models of patients with epilepsy. These data include both physiological and region connectivities, collectively represented as a virtual brain. A combination of the BigBrain model with heart resources (see cardiovascular use-case) based on very large data sets (TB to PB range) available in the repository will be investigated by EDITH to create a data-driven model. Brain, and the brain stem in particular, influence heart function and this is an exemplary trial case of organ integration towards Virtual Human Twins (VHTs). Thus, it will allow a personalised treatment planning.

Ethical and Legal




REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

EDITH will ground its technological path on EU applicable legislation, including, in particular, Privacy and Data Protection, Artificial Intelligence, as well as In silico Clinical Trial and Medical Device related laws. Special attention will be paid to some key upcoming, or recently adopted, developments such as the Data Governance Act, the Data Act, and the European Health Data Space, to ensure that EDITHs roadmap to Virtual Human Twin (VHT) outlines new requirements and an advanced regulatory guidance for reinforcing healthcare and medical research stakeholders accountability. Leveraging on EDITH partners multi-sectoral expertise, all major hurdles deriving from the current legal framework, which may prevent, or slow down the progress and uptake of a compliant, secure, ethically compatible and privacy-preserving VHT ecosystem, will be examined to propose improvements and compliance streamlining. Therefore, issues like cross-border health data sharing, reuse of medical data, pseudonymization and benefits of specific privacy-enhancing technologies (such as federated learning, synthetic data, and secure multi-party computation) to foster security and boost citizens trust will all be included in the roadmap.
				



CODE OF CONDUCT

The concept of Code of Conduct implies a triple step by any concerned industry: first creating awareness, then self-examination and, last, setting of sector-tailored and self-imposed high compliance standards. In the case of EDITH, the definition of conduct rules represents a statement of intent. Drawing inspiration from this novel accountability tool put forward in the General Data Protection Regulation (Articles 40 and 41), aiming to pave the way to an easier and more homogeneous application of the applicable legal obligations, EDITH will outline a prospective guidance suggesting innovative regulatory trails and industry-specific technological and legal measures to overcome current hurdles for sharing and reusing health data. Best practices outlined within EDITH will be transposed into possible legal, although elective, commitments to enhance compliance by stakeholders and strengthen general trust in Virtual Human Twin (VHT) by AI developers, technology providers, end-users (particularly healthcare professionals and patients), regulatory agencies, and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies.

EDITH-CSA Knowledge Base


					EDITH-CSA developed an interactive knowledge base leveraging OpenAI GPT models. The system allows to ask questions about the Virtual Human Twin in natural language, and receive pertinent answers on the basis of the relevant literature. The tool is available for testing at the following 




Current standards and guidelines

To know more about the FAIR sharing standards collection for EDITH click .

To construct Virtual Human Twins from health data complex multi-scale and multi-organ modelling processes must be brought together. This calls for data that are highly interoperable to integrate them into the modelling processes, but also for interoperable models and standardized output, as well as quality assurance of the models.
To this end, standards for data formatting and data input into the models () and for data publication () are defined, as well as for data preparation and the modelling process itself (). To standardize the description of the data and models, they should be semantically annotated by using domain-specific ontology terms according to minimum reporting guidelines. Provenance information for each data handling and processing step should be captured in a standardized way ().
To assess the quality of the models and their output, the model credibility and modelling results should be validated ( and ). Where applicable, model exchange should do, based on model standards like SBML or CellML, which are defined by  (Computational Modelling in Biology Network) and other scientific standardization initiatives.
To make the data and models interoperable it is suggested to use the Biomedical Research IntegratedGroup(BRIDG) domain model () and the  (Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) framework. For phenotypic data exchange the phenopackets standard (), defined by  (Global Alliance for Genomics and Health), can be used to link detailed phenotypic descriptions with information about disease, patient, diagnosis, treatments, and genetic information.

Vision
 Virtual Human Twin (VHT) is an integrated multiscale, multi-time, and multi-discipline representation of quantitative human physiology and pathology. Its realisation through a collaborative distributed knowledge and resource platform is specifically designed to accelerate the development, integration, and adoption of patient-specific predictive computer models, which will be used as clinical decision support systems, for personal health forecasting or as methodologies for the development and de-risking of personalised medical products. The vision of EDITH is to facilitate the realisation of the opportunities presented by VHTs for the benefit of patients, healthcare providers, regulatory bodies and industry, both within Europe and globally. 
				





Mission
 EDITH is a Coordination and Support Action (CSA), funded by the European Commission, which will capitalise on the developments of digital technologies, high performance computing, availability and access to research and healthcare data in Europe, with the mission of defining a roadmap to go from separated single organ systems, to data-driven and knowledge-driven fully integrated multiscale and multiorgan whole-body twin. EDITH will facilitate this process by building an evolutionary ecosystem, driven by a consensus among the relevant European communities, and implemented through the aid of practical tools, such as a data/model repository (within the scope of EDITH), and a simulation platform (to be implemented after EDITH).  
				





Focus
 A Virtual Human Twin (VHT) is a patient-specific virtual representation of real-world systems or processes, that is built on data-driven or knowledge-driven - most often a combination of both - predictive computer models, and that can be used as a clinical decision-support system, a personal health forecasting tool or as a tool for the development and personalisation of medical products. The focus of EDITH is to propose how a fully integrated VHT can be developed, starting from single organ digital twins.
				











Objectives




ECOSYSTEM
EDITH has the objective to frame an inclusive ecosystem of digital twins in healthcare within the EU Member States and associated countries. It will start with a comprehensive mapping of the existing relevant actors, initiatives, resources (i.e., models, data sets, methods, good practices, infrastructures, solutions, services), and barriers in the digital twins. This will ensure adequate clinical representation, while fostering collaboration and integration of all relevant stakeholders, such as solution developers, technology providers, infrastructure providers, end-users (healthcare professionals and patients), regulatory agencies, and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies.





ROADMAP
EDITH has the objective to build a roadmap with all the necessary conditions to evolve towards an integrated Virtual Human Twin (VHT). The roadmap will identify the necessary building blocks to ensure the VHTs clinical application and formulate clear short- and mid-term policy recommendations. It will also address aspects of interoperability, computability, health information integration from various sources. It will identify any possible implementation needs and barriers, including the development of a strategic approach for clinical deployment of the VHT model. This will foster the uptake of personalised clinical decision-making, with a particular focus on areas of unmet medical needs.


 




REPOSITORY
EDITH has the objective to develop a federated and cloud-based repository of digital twins (data, models, algorithms, and good practices) in healthcare. The repository will provide a virtual collaboration environment for multiple users and organisations, that will pool together existing digital twin resources across Europe. The ecosystem will be leveraged to create a repository catalogue with available resources and recruit resources into the repository from the consortium and external contributors. Through a federated approach, links will be established with ongoing initiatives that have complementary objectives.





SIMULATION PLATFORM
EDITH has the objective to develop the architecture of a simulation platform that will support the transition towards an integrated Virtual Human Twin (VHT). EDITHs platform, based on a personal user account with specific permissions, will outline how to provide users with a one-stop shop to design, develop, test, and validate single organ digital twins, and combine them with other twins to build integrated VHT models. Five use-cases (cancer, cardiovascular, intensive care, osteoporosis, brain) have been pre-selected to be developed as prototypes, representing the variety of functionalities to be provided by the platform.

							Spot on a use case: Digital Twins in Intensive Care							




Early diagnosis and prognosis of impending critical syndromes are crucial for optimising therapeutic strategies in intensive care. The extensive data in the intensive care unit (ICU) can use machine learning models (ML) as the basis for patient-centred digital twins to manage the complexity and instability of critically ill patients health conditions.
Building machine learning models in the ICU is supported by the Diagnostic Expert Advisor (DEA), a research platform that transforms heterogeneous ICU data into ML models.
In the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the feasibility of a prediction model for the syndrome developed within the DEA platform was demonstrated.
University Hospital Aachen () is bringing its experience in embedding DEA into the open EDITH platform, so that it could open the way for the prediction of other critical conditions in ICU patients, such as septic shock, acute kidney injury.

							EDITH technical meeting: new insights for the future!							




From 15 to 17 April 2024, the EDITH consortium met for a technical meeting organised byat the co-working space  in the centre of Athens, Greece.
The first day was dedicated to technical discussions and demonstrations on the progress made so far on the different objectives, such as the simulation platform, the repository, the roadmap and the ecosystem in general.
The core part of the meeting was the preparation and presentation of several external use cases tackled on the second day after a brief introduction of EDITH. EDITH use cases are now ready to walk you through the EDITH platform. The essential tools and services will be incorporated into this initial version of the platform to provide an integrated demonstration.  says Amaryllis Raouzaiou, responsible for simulation platform development.
After the finishing touches made during the EDITH Athens meeting, the EDITH repository is now prepared to accept submissions of new EDITH use cases that will make available their models, workflows, and datasets to the EDITH Community.- Continued Sabato Mellone, resposible for the repository proof of concept.
The meeting ended on the third day with a plenary session where the responsibilities and gaps in finalising the roadmap, including the recommendations for the European Commission, were defined and the EDITH sustainability and mapping were tackled.
The adoption of Virtual Human Twins in healthcare must necessarily include the needs, wants and expectations of the different stakeholders in the ecosystem; That is why in EDITH we follow an inclusive ecosystem approach for writing the roadmap, concluded Lies Geris, the EDITH project coordinator and the executive director.

							SPOT ON A USE-CASE: THE CARDIOVASCULAR APPLICATION							




Cardiovascular diseases, one of the most common causes of death in the EU, include atrial fibrillation, the most common form of cardiac arrhythmia, which affects over 37 million people worldwide. Atrial fibrillation is also more common in cancer patients and can lead to stroke or heart failure if not treated successfully. The underlying mechanisms of this connection are still unclear. However, virtual twins could provide an ideal framework for their investigation. With the help of digital twin technology, researchers can more accurately predict a patients response to treatment and plan customised interventions if necessary.
EDITH partners  and  offer a pathway to personalised in silico treatment planning and model predictions in clinical timeframes. To overcome the challenges of large-scale heart modelling, they are developing a robust open-source pipeline for constructing atrial models based on their previously developed method incorporating atrial regions and fibres. These models were constructed as either two coupled surfaces (a bilayer model) or a volumetric model.
In addition, a cohort of 1000 bi-atrial bilayer and volume models derived from computed tomography (CT) data, as well as models derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electro-anatomical mapping data were created. Fibrillation dynamics diverged between the bilayer and volumetric simulations in the CT cohort. Structural and electrophysiological changes in the cardiac tissue due to scar tissue were found to stabilise the re-entries and reduce the impact of the model type (bilayer or volumetric). These models can be used to compare responses to different treatment approaches.
Overall,  and  are successfully testing the integration of the respective resources and cardiac modelling workflows as a proof-of-concept for the creation of virtual human twins (VHTs) and the development of a user-friendly open-source pipeline to generate atrial models from imaging or electro-anatomical mapping data, enabling large-scale in silico clinical studies.

							FIRST ECOSYSTEM MEETING TO BUILD THE VHT: BEYOND THE FULFILMENT OF EDITHS MISSION!							




The First ecosystem meeting on building the VHT, a productive two-day event, took place at the , France on January 18-19. Over 175 people registered for the meeting, representing all aspects of the ecosystem: academia, industry, research institutes, hospitals, HPC centres, HTA agencies, legal offices, ethics societies, as well as social sciences, civil and patient organisations.
The participants were welcomed by the host of the event, Irene Vignon-Clementel, Marie-Hlne Pautrat, Abdul Barakat (), and Jean Colombel (3DS). Liesbet Geris, Professor in Biomechanics and Computational Tissue Engineering at the University of Lige and KU Leuven,the EDITH project coordinator and the  executive director, introduced the meeting organisation: several plenary session, along with fourteen parallel breakout sessions focussed on EDITH key themes.
The parallel sessions throughout both days fuelled the discussion around key aspects for the realization of the Virtual Human Twin: resource integration, ethics, data generation, business models, platform processes and services, usability, standards for digital twins, clinical engagement, infrastructures and networks, contribution to the VHT resources via new use-cases, AI, incentivization, ecosystem economic preconditions, and social trust. All sessions were led by high-calibre speakers from the EDITH consortium and partners, includingAmaryllis Raouzaiou (), Adrian Ionescu, (), Martin Golebiewski and Gerhard Mayer (), Irene Vignon-Clementel, Roel Meiburg, and Anna Niarakis(), Ine Van Hoyweghen, Elisabetta Biasin, Elisa Lievevrouw, Elisa Leila Elhadj (), Edwin Morley-Fletcher (), Enzo Fabiani (), Caroline Roney, Elisa Rauseo, and Laura Bevis (), Sabato Mellone(), Alfons Hoekstra (), Gkhan Ertaylan, Elfi Goesaert and Frederic Jung (), and Zita Van Horenbeeck().
In his plenary address, the European Commission representative, Kyriacos Hatzaras (), called upon all participants to brainstorm and participate in setting short- and medium-term goals for the fulfilment of EDITHs objectives, to align the vision of the entire ecosystem and its stakeholders to realise the Virtual Human Twin.
The second day of work started with a presentation on The Clinical Perspective on Virtual Human Twins by Eric Vibert () and ended with plenary presentations of the existing platforms and large scale initiatives such as BBMRI-ERIC (Konrad Lang, ), EBRAINS (Victor Jirsa, ) and the 12 Labours project (Thiranja Prasad Babarenda Gamage, ). Finally, the valuable insights from the breakout session reports provided additional inspiration for tackling some of the identified challenges.
Over the last couple of months, the ecosystem has demonstrated a very strong interest and commitment to deploy and realise the Virtual Human Twin for health and care. At the Paris meeting, we had a solid representation of all stakeholders in the ecosystem and hence were able to address a wide range of topics from many angles. These inputs will further ensure the VHT roadmap to be representing the interests of the entire ecosystem. Concluded Liesbet Geris.

							Spot on a EDITH use case: The innovative EPFL biosensing platform							




According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), , making them the leading cause of death worldwide. This urgency has led to a growing interest in continuous on-site monitoring of specific biomarkers that pave the way for early diagnosis and more effective treatment and follow-up.
In response, there is an urgent need to identify cardiac biomarkers early to mitigate patient outcomes and mortality based on more proactive approaches. These approaches are enabled by the use of Digital Twins (DTs). EDITH partner  is developing an innovative, wearable biosensing platform as a data generator for future human DTs, using electrical sensor technology to enable multiplexed real-time detection of key cardiovascular markers with high sensitivity and selectivity.
By analysing the interstitial fluid, the  solution provides a dynamic and comprehensive overview of a patients cardiovascular status. The real-time data generated by the  platform serves as the basis for building a dynamic DT with predictive capabilities. This facilitates rapid medical interventions and clinical decisions to achieve the best possible outcomes for the patient while reducing medical errors.
Some of the results will be presented at the upcoming  in 2024, organised by the European Innovation Council (EIC) proactive projects ,  and , with the participation of the EDITH coordinator and its partners.

							Spot on a EDITH use-case: Osteoporosis							




The most catastrophic fracture that older people affected by osteoporosis can suffer is that of the femur: 20% of patients die within a year because of the fracture, and the vast majority never regain their original mobility and independence.
Osteoporosis is a disease that affects the bones and makes them more fragile, so that an otherwise harmless fall can lead to a fracture. It mainly affects older women who show no symptoms prior to the fracture event. It is therefore of the utmost importance to recognise patients at high risk of fracture at an early stage and to initiate therapies and interventions.
The EDITH partner, the , has developed a new digital twin for the use-case osteoporosis to predict the risk of femur fractures in elderly patients based on a femur CT scan. This solution combines patient-specific bone models with stochastic fall models to account for variability and increase accuracy and applicability. The model helps healthcare professionals to assess patients fracture risk and adapt behavioural and pharmacological treatment.
This digital twin has surpassed the current clinical standard for osteoporosis diagnosis based on retrospective data and is now involved in a clinical trial for validation with a prospective cohort.

The first ecosystem meeting on building the VHT will take place on 18 and 19 January 2024 at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France.
With the help of the consortium, the advisory boards, the experts and the wider ecosystem (through public meetings and a public feedback phase), EDITH-CSA has created a first draft of the . Its main purpose is to identify the different elements that need to be elaborated and supported within the VHT.
The aim of this first meeting is to continue working on the VHT roadmap and ensure that it contains all the necessary building blocks and considerations to realise the VHT. Therefore, the meeting will consist of a mix of plenary sessions and breakouts covering (among others) topics such as clinical uptake, commercialisation, real-world data, AI, ethics, integration of resources, European platforms, incentivization, and new use-cases.
At the end of the meeting, the work (developing and writing) and the organisation (working groups, online meetings, Slack) will be structured for the next 6 months. All this work will be brought together during the second public VHT ecosystem meeting (on 15-16 July 2024 in KIT, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and translated into a tangible 10-year plan.
All members of the ecosystem, including (but not limited to) colleagues from academia, industry, research institutes, hospitals, HPC centres, regulators, notified bodies, HTA agencies, law firms, ethics societies as well as social sciences, citizen and patient organisations are invited to participate!

Vision
 Virtual Human Twin (VHT) is an integrated multiscale, multi-time, and multi-discipline representation of quantitative human physiology and pathology. Its realisation through a collaborative distributed knowledge and resource platform is specifically designed to accelerate the development, integration, and adoption of patient-specific predictive computer models, which will be used as clinical decision support systems, for personal health forecasting or as methodologies for the development and de-risking of personalised medical products. The vision of EDITH is to facilitate the realisation of the opportunities presented by VHTs for the benefit of patients, healthcare providers, regulatory bodies and industry, both within Europe and globally. 
				





Mission
 EDITH is a Coordination and Support Action (CSA), funded by the European Commission, which will capitalise on the developments of digital technologies, high performance computing, availability and access to research and healthcare data in Europe, with the mission of defining a roadmap to go from separated single organ systems, to data-driven and knowledge-driven fully integrated multiscale and multiorgan whole-body twin. EDITH will facilitate this process by building an evolutionary ecosystem, driven by a consensus among the relevant European communities, and implemented through the aid of practical tools, such as a data/model repository (within the scope of EDITH), and a simulation platform (to be implemented after EDITH).  
				





Focus
 A Virtual Human Twin (VHT) is a patient-specific virtual representation of real-world systems or processes, that is built on data-driven or knowledge-driven - most often a combination of both - predictive computer models, and that can be used as a clinical decision-support system, a personal health forecasting tool or as a tool for the development and personalisation of medical products. The focus of EDITH is to propose how a fully integrated VHT can be developed, starting from single organ digital twins.
				











Objectives




ECOSYSTEM
EDITH has the objective to frame an inclusive ecosystem of digital twins in healthcare within the EU Member States and associated countries. It will start with a comprehensive mapping of the existing relevant actors, initiatives, resources (i.e., models, data sets, methods, good practices, infrastructures, solutions, services), and barriers in the digital twins. This will ensure adequate clinical representation, while fostering collaboration and integration of all relevant stakeholders, such as solution developers, technology providers, infrastructure providers, end-users (healthcare professionals and patients), regulatory agencies, and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies.





ROADMAP
EDITH has the objective to build a roadmap with all the necessary conditions to evolve towards an integrated Virtual Human Twin (VHT). The roadmap will identify the necessary building blocks to ensure the VHTs clinical application and formulate clear short- and mid-term policy recommendations. It will also address aspects of interoperability, computability, health information integration from various sources. It will identify any possible implementation needs and barriers, including the development of a strategic approach for clinical deployment of the VHT model. This will foster the uptake of personalised clinical decision-making, with a particular focus on areas of unmet medical needs.


 




REPOSITORY
EDITH has the objective to develop a federated and cloud-based repository of digital twins (data, models, algorithms, and good practices) in healthcare. The repository will provide a virtual collaboration environment for multiple users and organisations, that will pool together existing digital twin resources across Europe. The ecosystem will be leveraged to create a repository catalogue with available resources and recruit resources into the repository from the consortium and external contributors. Through a federated approach, links will be established with ongoing initiatives that have complementary objectives.





SIMULATION PLATFORM
EDITH has the objective to develop the architecture of a simulation platform that will support the transition towards an integrated Virtual Human Twin (VHT). EDITHs platform, based on a personal user account with specific permissions, will outline how to provide users with a one-stop shop to design, develop, test, and validate single organ digital twins, and combine them with other twins to build integrated VHT models. Five use-cases (cancer, cardiovascular, intensive care, osteoporosis, brain) have been pre-selected to be developed as prototypes, representing the variety of functionalities to be provided by the platform.
