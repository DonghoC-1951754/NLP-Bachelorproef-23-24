STRENGTHENING THE PATIENT VOICE IN HEALTH CARE


The Health Outcomes Observatory project (H2O) brings together the public and private sectors to create an unprecedented, standardised data governance and infrastructure system across Europe to incorporate patients experiences and preferences in decisions affecting their individual health care and those of the entire patient community.
With H2O infrastructure and tools, patients will be able to measure their outcomes in a standardised way, whilst keeping full control of their data. Ultimately, this framework of Observatories aims to foster innovation in health care in Europe and beyond todeliver better outcomes for all.




H2O vision



Data governed and managed by the Health Outcomes Observatories will be accessed by patients and their health care providers to promote a richer and fruitful dialogue between patient and health care professionals based on meaningful information.
H2O aims to create a robust data governance model that gives patients control of their data and enables ethical, secure analysis of the data when patients consent to this, in the interest of society, science and patient care. Standardised and structured health data will be available for analysis in order to:

enhance health research prospects
promote the development of new treatments that reflect outcomes reported by patients
sustain more efficient healthcare systems

There are various THC detox treatments available, including home cures. A natural cleanse will take the most time, but it will be the most effective and comprehensive detox method.
Most natural detoxification procedures are simple to implement and may be used in tandem to achieve the optimum effects. Making these adjustments, whether in detox mode or not, can lead to healthy living patterns.
Detoxification is one of the most important ways to prepare your body for a painless drug test. However, in order to completely detoxify and prepare your body, you must first understand how most drug tests work.
THC Detox beverages are promoted for their capacity to temporarily flush THC out of the body on the  of ingestion. Most detox beverages only work for a few hours. Nonetheless, these detox beverages might enhance your body's natural detoxification process.
A drug test may be dumped on you abruptly, leaving you with no time to cleanse your system before the test. In such case,  to pass a urin drug test is to use synthetic urine to pass the test.
Assume you're a light marijuana user with a thin layer of marijuana metabolite concentration in your hair and scalp. In that situation, apple cider vinegar may aid in your drug test successNewsletter

VISION & OBJECTIVES
OUR VISION
H2O will strengthen the patient voice in health care with the aim of improving outcomes and fostering a value based approach in healthcare systems. This is the first-ever attempt at scale to collect and incorporate patient outcomes into health care decision making at an individual and population level.
To achieve this vision, we have formed a strategic alliance between the public and private sectors to bring to life H2O. We intend it to be a catalyst project that stimulates a greater interest in using health outcomes data, including patient-reported outcomes, encourages the adoption of the approach in other countries and other disease areas, and ultimately, improves care and, therefore, health. 

The H2O project represents a collaborative initiative with patients, health care providers, researchers, life-sciences industry, health authorities and regulatory bodies all taking part. This project embodies an exciting innovative journey where information on patients views, experiences and self-reported outcomes are transformed through the Observatories into meaningful individual- and collective- knowledge thus fostering innovation in health care in Europe and beyond.




OUR MISSION
An important gap lies in our (still limited) understanding of the value of outcomes to patients, with a corresponding challenge of how this information can be incorporated into the process of care. This needs to be solved before healthcare systems can be considered value based. We are set to change the current scenario by:



Creating the governance to unleash the potential of patient health data
The network of Observatories will ensure that data is made available to all -patients, researchers, providers, health authorities, regulatory bodies, and industry  to improve care and outcomes, whilst providing the governance framework that will allow the management of this data in an ethical and compliant way in order to better safeguard this essential resource in the interest of society as a whole.


Fostering engagement to drive patient empowerment
With the support of digital tools being developed by H2O, patients will not only be able to track how they feel and visualise their information in a dashboard. They will also be able to compare how they are doing with others, and then discuss any variations with their physicians. This will be done through anonymised data voluntarily provided by patients to improve care for the whole patient community as well as their own.


Protecting patients privacy rights
Establishing an ethical and comprehensive governance infrastructure in Europe to safeguard data for and on behalf of patients is one of the main objectives of H2O. The observatories will ensure that patients privacy rights are protected and that, at the same time, they can fully benefit from the potential structured data holds in improving their health care -and this of the entire community- by allowing a dramatic advancement in research across Europe.


Developing a user-friendly system for patients and health care providers
With the patient needs in mind and their input, H2O will co-create streamlined, easy to use tools and processes to ensure that only meaningful, relevant, and comprehensible health data is introduced in a straightforward and intuitive way. Health care professionals will gain access to systematic and robust patient reported information to help them better understand the patient and more effectively provide treatment.


Building knowledge on what really matters to patients to foster value based health care
What really matters to patients will be systematically brought into the equation to provide a deeper understanding of burden of disease and health systems performance with a view to identify areas for potential improvement. The H2O framework will contribute to the development of valued-based approaches in health systems across Europe and beyond.


Creating Observatories, initially in 4 countries ready to operate in 3 disease areas
The H2O project will set up Observatories in four countries (plus and umbrella, European Observatory) focusing on three disease areas (initially) that will collect data and provide information not only for individual clinical care, but also for enabling evaluation of new technologies, for health care decision making and for research.

Impact

Like water, data is an essential resource, and within the health care system it can be used to empower and serve patients, whilst safeguarding their privacy. Health data has the potential to inform and facilitate a richer dialogue between patients and their healthcare providers as well as improve self-management, thus resulting in better care for individuals and more efficient and sustainable health care systems for the entire community.
H2O is set to transform the use of patient-reported information in health care, enrich the interaction between patient and provider and, as a result, drive better outcomes for patients. The H2O approach will deliver a positive impact across the health care ecosystem by enhancing health research prospects, promoting the development of new treatments that reflect outcomes reported by patients and sustaining more efficient healthcare systems.

Work Packages

H2O has established an ambitious work plan to create an unprecedented, standardised data governance and infrastructure system across Europe to incorporate patients opinions and preferences in health care. The transformational nature of this project calls for intense collaboration in different spheres of expertise. Work has been organised around 4 general areas -governance, technical infrastructure, Observatories management and scientific coordination and project management- and 3 disease specific work groups focusing on diabetes, IBD and cancer.
Leading experts representing top-level organisations involved in H2O are working hand in hand across these different areas to deliver the expected results by 2025. Next, you will find more detailed information about the scope of each work package.


















WP1
Governance, Sustainability, Capabilities
This work package is responsible for defining the core concept of H2O. The scope of its work ranges involves devising the governance and legal framework, business architecture and quality assurance processes of the H2O ecosystem and ensuring the ability of the Observatories to collect new data and make them fit to be catalysts for interoperability with existing health data sources in the respective countries.


WP2
Technical infrastructure and interoperability
Work package 2 is focused on the design and implementation of the technical architecture of the H2O project, to support data management according to the project vision. These encompasses the implementation of a patient app for PRO data collection and a health care provider portal, and the development of a data integration platform, together with the overall Observatory framework.




WP3
Diabetes
This work package supports improvement in diabetes outcomes by collecting diabetes-related (Type 1 and Type 2) clinical and patient-reported health status data and by utilising these data to inform decision making by patients and health care providers. Amongst other objectives work package 3 is responsible for the development of a European consensus for a standardized, core data, and the preparation of multilingual guidance and education material for patients and health care professionals, besides providing data for segmentation of the population.



WP4
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Work package 4 aims to contribute to address some of IBD significant unmet needs among different subpopulations and advance on greater patient-centricity and personalization of treatments to achieve better outcomes for IBD patients. This work package focuses on developing a European consensus for a minimum set of standardized outcomes for IBD, defining technological requirements and preparing multilingual guidance and education material for patients and health care professionals.



WP5
Cancer treatment
One of the main objectives of work package 5 consists of selecting appropriate standards for capturing the patient perspective of diseases through PRO instruments and wearables, in combination with clinical data to better capture the patient perspective of cancer and the impact of (novel) treatments. This work package also focuses on establishing technological requirements and designing strategies for patient participation, and physician awareness and engagement, in the collection and use of PROs.



WP6
Observatory management: communication and analysis
The main objective of work package 6 is to implement, operate and coordinate a network of H2O Observatories (including four National H2O and one Pan-European Umbrella H2O Observatory) and to ensure their sustainability and scalability in the long term. This work package is also responsible for conducting innovative data analysis, manage the gateway for users to anonymised and also to aggregated data, by overseeing and supporting the appropriate, governed and secure access to this data.


WP7

Ethical Legal and Social Impact Board

The mission of the H2O is empower patients with tools that help them measure their outcomes in a standardized way in order to :

Have better, evidence based communications with their HCPs that will allow shared decision making;
Give patients full control of their data;
Create transparency of outcomes and enable scientific insights to improve patient outcomes, advance scientific research and improve allocation of healthcare resources.
Improve the healthcare information landscape.

Some of the fundamental principles guiding our thinking are to:

Ensure patient control of their data;
Create a model of governance whereby no stakeholder derives power from access to data. To the contrary, stakeholders are incentivized to share their data and enable access to all bona fide researchers from both the public and private sector.
Unleash the power of health data and enable innovation and technological advancements to deliver to their fullest potential in health.
Implement GDPR and other applicable local rules to safeguard patients rights
Ensure the highest possible standards of cyber security to protect patients data
Demonstrate the value of multi-stakeholder engagement in order to reach broad consensus and achieve standardization;
Showcase how public private partnerships and a mindset focusing on win  win models can create superior value for all stakeholders and contribute to a more sustainable healthcare.
Advance the thinking on how to improve health equity by encouraging transparency of patient outcomes including those related to socio-economic factors.

To put our principles into practice we are working on a number of policies, codes of conduct and other implementation measures. At the same time we are cognizant that in order to be successful we would need to win the hearts and minds of several stakeholders and we need to be mindful of their perspectives.
To succeed in our mission, we have appointed an Ethical Legal and Social Impact Board that will challenge us, guide us and support us in making the right decisions. The ELSI Board will convene 4-6 times per year and the discussions will be focus on the policies, codes of conduct and other implementation measures planned to achieve our mission.

About the Observatories

The national Observatories are independent, not-for-profit, legal entities created for data collection, analysis and evidence sharing to inform clinical practice and healthcare decisions. These ethically and legally sound national, or regional, H2Os are initially being created in four countries -Netherlands, Austria, Germany and Spain- covering three diseases -cancer, diabetes and IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease)-. They operate under a governance model that guarantees data protection under national and European jurisdictions. These independent entities (observatories) guard data on behalf of patients, who keep control of their own data being used for individual and collective care, research or the evaluation of new technologies.
These H2Os connect to a pan-European Observatory to facilitate interoperability, guide reproducibility in other countries, and promote the benefit of measuring and using patient-centred outcomes at regional, national, European and global levels.



Information about the national Observatories will soon be available

How do they work?

The primary aim of H2O is to provide patients and their health care providers with information for use in individual clinical care:


Each individual patient will see a personalised dashboard with information on their disease progression, treatment, and outcomes and how this compares with other patients experience through anonymised, aggregated data to ensure patients privacy rights are protected at all times.

The personalised information will allow each patient to have better discussions with their health care providers and to better manage their own condition

Each individual patient will be able to compare his or her well-being with aggregated data from similar patients with the aim of equipping him or her to better manage their care and, therefore, their outcomes.

With the patients consent, the relevant health care professional(s) will also receive the information, allowing for regular and up to date tracking.

The second major aim of H2O is to make the information available in order that patient-reported data is at the heart of broader healthcare decision making:


H2O will enable health authorities to compare different patient pathways and select the most efficient ones, optimising patient outcomes and costs.

Researchers will be able to conduct studies based on real world evidence to inform future interventions.

National and international patient organisations will be able to use aggregated information as evidence in providing guidance and advocacy.

Industry will be able to conduct analyses to inform drug development activities and generate evidence for submission to health authorities

This new source of information will facilitate benchmarking and will add an extra dimension for HTA bodies in their assessments of the value of health care. This, in turn, will permit continual adjustments to healthcare approaches, making continuous value-based healthcare improvements a reality.

Ein wichtiger Schritt fr bessere Gesundheitsdaten: Das Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O) startet offiziell in Deutschland
Berlin, Deutschland  28.09.2023
Unterschiedliche Akteure aus dem privaten und ffentlichen Sektor haben ihre Krfte gebndelt, um das Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O), einer von der Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) untersttzten Initiative, in Deutschland zu etablieren. Das Ziel von H2O ist es, die Forschung durch umfassende Datensammlung voranzutreiben und damit bessere Ergebnisse fr PatientInnen zu erzielen. hnlich wie bereits etablierte Beobachtungszentren in den Niederlanden, sterreich und Spanien wird auch das deutsche Beobachtungszentrum, H2O e.V., den Fokus auf die Bedrfnisse der PatientInnen legen. Kontrolliert von PatientInnen, sollen Erkenntnisse aus der realen Welt in praxisnaher Weise gesammelt werden  einschlielich den Erfahrungen der Patienten und Patientinnen. Dabei werden die Daten einheitlich erfasst, um die Kommunikation zwischen PatientInnen und rztInnen zu verbessern, und Forschungsergebnisse besser nutzbar zu machen.
Der H2O e.V. startet zu einem Zeitpunkt, an dem die Diskussionen um die Erneuerung des Gesundheitswesens in Deutschland auf einem Hhepunkt sind. Debatten um die geplante Krankenhausreform, die Elektronische Gesundheitsakte und die steigenden Kosten fr die gesetzliche Krankenversicherung zeigen verdeutlichen die Notwendigkeit von Vernderungen. Der deutsche Ableger des H2O knnte einen Beitrag zur Lsung dieser Probleme leisten. Er wurde von einem Konsortium angesehener PartnerInnen gegrndet, die sich fr positiven Vernderungen im Gesundheitswesen einsetzen.


ber H2O 
Das Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O) ist ein ffentlich-privates Konsortium, das Patienten, Leistungserbringer, Regulierungsbehrden und Entscheidungstrger des Gesundheitswesens zusammenbringt. Das gemeinsame Ziel ist, Patient:innen in den Mittelpunkt einer wertorientierten Gesundheitsversorgung zu stellen. Dazu werden die von den Patient:innen berichteten subjektiven Wahrnehmungen (Patient Reported Outcomes, PROs) standardisiert erfasst und in die Entscheidungsfindung einbezogen. Wenn rzt:innen und Patient:innen eine gemeinsame Sprache sprechen, ergeben sich daraus Vorteile, wie verbesserte Kommunikation, Einblicke in die Realitt von Patientenpopulationen, hhere Versorgungsqualitt und nachhaltige Gesundheitsversorgung.
H2O wird derzeit an mehreren Standorten in Europa eingerichtet.
Untersttzt durch einen Zuschuss der IMI
Dieses Projekt wurde vom Gemeinsamen Unternehmen Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) 2 im Rahmen der Finanzhilfevereinbarung Nr. 945345-2 gefrdert. Das Gemeinsame Unternehmen wird durch das Forschungs- und Innovationsprogramm Horizont 2020 der Europischen Union sowie durch EFPIA und Trial Nation und JDRF untersttzt.

H2O, with and for patients
Patients play a major role in shaping a new future for health care in Europe. A future where their insights and experiences are also taken into account in decisions concerning their care. This is H2Os vision.
As a project focused on empowering patients to deliver better care outcomes, we would like to tell you more about H2O and the positive impact it will bring to the patient community, and to society as a whole.
You can also find more information about H2Os expected impacts  or learn about the contribution the  are making to the project.





Next, we try to answer some questions about H2O that may go through your mind, as a patient, carer or patient representative.
What is H2O (Health Outcomes Observatory project)? 

H2O is a public/ private partnership that aims to set up patient centric national pan-European observatories to strengthen the voice of patients in the individual relationship with their healthcare providers, but also in health systems more broadly.
This is the first ever attempt at collecting and including patient outcomes in healthcare decision making at scale.

What does the H2O project focus on? 

The project will establish health outcomes observatories in Germany, Spain, Austria and the Netherlands; and it will focus on three disease areas: Diabetes, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and Cancer.
H2O will strengthen the patient voice by providing patients with tools to measure their health outcomes (or measurements) in a standardised way, and at the same time giving them full control of their data, including deciding who can access it.
If patients choose to share their data, it will be anonymised and stored securely.

What are the long-term goals of the project?

In the long-term, H2O aims to help patients have better communications with their providers and create transparency of outcomes; This will help all stakeholders better understand how to improve patient care.
H2O will also aim to establish a wider range of observatories in more countries and covering more disease areas.

What is the importance of H2O for the patient community?

Often, the way diseases are measured is largely based on input from clinicians.
Because of this, these measurements (or outcomes) do not necessarily include the experiences of the patients, and the impact of a disease on their life.
The aim of this project is to create a framework that incorporates and amplifies the patient voice both in their own healthcare and in healthcare systems more broadly.
By creating this framework, H2O hopes to:

improve the dialogue between patient and healthcare provider, so that patients receive better care;
improve healthcare professionals access to data to inform their clinical decisions;
and ultimately improve the quality and sustainability of care based on outcomes that truly matter to patients.



Who will use the patients data? 

The patient may choose to share their data with their doctor or other health care provider so that they can have better communications and discuss their progress and outcomes.
Patients may also choose to allow their data to be included in an anonymised pool of data that will allow researchers to get better insights about their disease, possible treatments or quality of care..
One of the roles of the observatories is to ensure that this data is accessed ethically. It will therefore be made available to stakeholders that have a legitimate interest to use it for scientific or policy research.
This information can help researchers understand the disease better and find possible treatments, help policy makers identify how to improve care, help doctors understand what matters most to patients, allow companies to develop new therapies, and guide society on how to best use resources to improve healthcare.

H2O Patient AgreementThe H2O Patient Agreement is a legal agreement of the kind most of us are familiar with when we sign up to any app. However, it is unique in a number of features:

It begins with the assumption that patients remain in control of their data, rather than signing away control as a default;
It gives clear guidance and options to opt in or out of sharing data with anyone, including Health Care Professionals;
It enables the option of data sharing with accredited institutions for research purposes with the option to opt-out where patients would prefer not to be part of research;
It sets up the permissions to allow the combination of outcome data with electronic health records residing in healthcare facilities.

This is one of the main cornerstones of what H2O stands for: unleashing the power of patient reported outcomes while keeping patients in control of their health data.
We are grateful to the members of the H2O Patient Advisory Boards (PAB) who have been instrumental in shaping this agreement. The document was developed in continuous consultation with the PABs, culminating in a face to face meeting at our offices in Brussels. During that meeting, the advisors told us loud and clear the H2O ecosystem can be a game-changer for patient empowerment.

FAQS

What is health data? 

Health data refers to a type of (digital) information that helps us to understand a persons health, their health risks, and how their health is being managed.
It can be created by patients and healthcare professionals  like through electronic health records, prescription records, lab tests, etc.
And it can be created through mobile phone applications, wearable devices, etc.

What is data security? 

Data security refers to protecting data and information systems from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

What is a health outcome? 

A health outcome refers to the way that a disease is assessed and measured. It usually includes measurements like symptoms, morbidity (the physical state/illness being considered) or mortality (death). These measurements are made using a clinical definition.
Clinical outcome: a type of outcome measurement which is made by a trained healthcare professional after observing a patients health condition. It can include measurements of how effective or safe a treatment is. .
Patient reported outcome (PRO): refers to the measurement of a patients experience or view in clinical care; the patients tells their healthcare provider themselves how they feel and what their level of functioning is in daily life; furthermore, they state what they want to achieve from a treatment.

A PRO can be used to assess symptoms as experienced by a patient, activity limitations and participation restrictions, quality of life, and other health perceptions. It is not a clinical measure, and it is typically collected using a questionnaire or interview.



What is Value Based Healthcare?
Value based care refers to an approach to healthcare where the outcomes that matter to patients are at the centre of decision making. This includes focusing on interventions that address prevention, social care, and healthcare in an integrated way around people and patients.

Visualising success: Check out the infographic, video, and posters explaining H2O

Its not always easy to explain something as technical and complex as the challenges and possibilities of using health data! Thats why we have created a  an , and posters highlighting the workings and benefits of H2O.
In under two-and-a-half minutes, this  explains the role of data in treating disease and the possibilities enabled by H2O in terms of patient empowerment and better conversations with healthcare providers. It also briefly shows how H2O secures patient data and can contribute to enhancing both health research and the sustainability and efficiency of healthcare systems.



 follows the journey of a patient, Lisa, as she uses H2O to track her outcomes and thus enjoy benefits such as having more effective conversations with her caregivers and better tracking and comparison of her treatment results. The visual also shows what Lisa can choose to do with her data, such as sharing it with relatives, or for research purposes.
Be sure to share these far and wide! The video especially can be posted on social media platforms, while the infographic can be shared both virtually and printed to be put on your office wall for educational purposes.
Other languages:








Additionally, posters in different languages have been created for patient organizations and hospitals to use and spread the word on H2O. Check them out!

About IMI
The Innovative Medicines Initiative is a partnership between the European Union and the European pharmaceutical industry, represented by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). It works to improve health by speeding up the development of the next generation of medicines, particularly in areas where there is an unmet medical or social need. It works by facilitating collaboration between the key players involved in health research, including universities, research centres, the pharmaceutical and other industries, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), patient organisations, and medicines regulators. IMI was the worlds biggest public-private partnership (PPP) in the life sciences until its successor, the Innovative Health Initiative (IHI), was established in 2021.

Radio Davos Podcast: Quality over quantity: why the time has come for value based health careNovember 2023




In a podcast with the World Economic Forum, H2O co-lead Meni Styliadou explores the potential benefits of a shift from volume to value, to patients and to health care providers.
The concept of value based health care  where patient outcomes are monitored and health care services are funded on the basis of the quality of care, rather than the quantity of procedures  has been around for a couple of decades, but has yet to become the norm.


This podcast explores the potential benefits of a shift from volume to value, to patients and to health care providers.


Guests:



Catherine MacLean, Chief Value Medical Officer at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.




Meni Styliadou, Founder and Co-lead of the Health Outcomes Observatory and VP Health Data Partnerships, Data Science Institute, Takeda (featured in episode artwork).






IHI Article: New agreement gives patients more control over their data11 October 2023



H2Os Patient Agreement was featured by the Innovative Health Initiative.
The project has recently developed a new way to formalise patients control over their health data through the newly-launched H2O Patient Agreement. Patients who sign on to this agreement join the H2O patient network, allowing them to measure both their own health outcomes and control how their data is used for research.




World Economic Forum Blog: Could the IKEA approach help assemble truly patient-centric healthcare?01 June 2023

What can IKEA & Healthcare have in common? H2O co-leads Tanja Stamm and Meni Styliadou wrote a blog published by the  on how the DIY approach invented by IKEA can pave the way to value-based health care by empowering patients to measure their outcomes.


Healthcare relies on clinical data sourced in part from patients.
Technology reporting patient outcomes in a standardized way would bolster global healthcare and policy-making.
IKEAs simple, participatory approach could provide a model for healthcare.

The Medicine Maker Blog: Tap the App - What can science learn from patients, and how can patients benefit from being in control of their own health?27 April 2023


While the pressing need for healthcare transformation is well-known, the fact that patient reported outcomes (PROs) could be one of the most powerful factors in driving sustainability within healthcare systems is often overlooked.
Francesco Patalano, WP6 co-lead, has explained to The Medicine Maker how PROs offer a huge opportunity to better understand the real burden of diseases on patients, their caregivers and society. While there are significant challenges that need to be addressed to unlock real world PROs, H2O is unleashing its potential by creating a common language that can pave the way for increased health data flow, improved #patient outcomes, and more sustainable and efficient healthcare systems.

World Economic Forum Report: The Moment of Truth for Healthcare Spending: How Payment Models can Transform Healthcare Systems05 January 2023

In this Insight Report from the World Economic Forum, H2O is one of 34 global case studies showcasing the transition to value-based healthcare.
The global healthcare budget crisis is not a new topic and rising healthcare costs continue to be a critical discussion point. The limits of what can be spent on healthcare are being reached, and further, this spend isnt correlated with improved patient outcomes. Healthcare systems worldwide urgently need transformation, but this change is possible only alongside the broadscale adoption of value-based payment models.



European Alliance for Value in Health Blog: Why arent we there yet? The role of partnerships in unleashing patient-centred health data21 November 2022


The European Alliance for Value in Health has featured a blog by H2O co-lead Meni Styliadou describing the gap that H2O seeks to cover and how its unique governance structure will make it happen.
In the Alliances vision for value-based and patient-centred health systems, the first principle is that outcomes that matter to patients should be at the centre of decision-making. In this blog, Meni Styliadou from Takeda and Francesco Patalano from Novartis, both EFPIA members, explains how the H2O public-private partnership will enable the collection of patient-centred data, contributing to making this crucial component of value-based health systems a reality.



IHI Profile: Reaching the desired (health) outcome26 September 2022



H2O was profiled by the Innovative Health Initiative after the launch of the first national observatories.
It may seem a statement of the obvious, but the most important element of any medical intervention is the outcome. However, its not quite as clearcut as we might think; the desired outcome  and the way to get there  may differ depending on who is asked. It could be the potential for cure, or it could be the ease of administration or the quality of life while undergoing treatment. Ultimately, however, it is the opinion of patient that matters most. The IMI project H2O Health outcomes observatory is seeking to ensure that the patients voice is heard loud and clear.

Abstract
Purpose
For patients living with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), achieving best possible health-related quality of life, along with maximizing survival, is vital. Yet, we have no systemic way to determine if we achieve these goals. A Core Outcome Set (COS) that allows standardized measurement of outcomes important to patients, but also promotes discussing these outcomes during clinical encounters, is long overdue.
Methods
An international expert group (EG) of patient advocates, researchers, medical specialists, nurse specialists, and pharmaceutical industry representatives (n=17) reviewed a list of relevant outcomes retrieved from the literature. A broader group (n=141: patients/patient advocates (n=45), health care professionals/researchers (n=64), pharmaceutical industry representatives (n=28), and health authority representatives (n=4)) participated in a modified Delphi procedure, scoring the relevance of outcomes in two survey rounds. The EG finalized the COS in a consensus meeting.
Results
The final MBC COS includes 101 variables about: (1) health-related quality of life (HRQoL, n=26) and adverse events (n=24); (2) baseline patient characteristics (n=9); and (3) clinical variables (n=42). Many outcome that cover aspects of HRQoL relevant to MBC patients are included, e.g. daily functioning (including ability to work), psychosocial/emotional functioning, sexual functioning, and relationship with the medical team.
Conclusion
The COS developed in this study contains important administrative data, clinical records, and clinician-reported measures that captures the impact of cancer. The COS is important for standardization of clinical research and implementation in daily practice and has received accreditation by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM).

Abstract
Background
In 2016, the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) defined an international consensus recommendation of the most important outcomes for lung cancer patients. The European Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O) initiative aimed to develop an updated patient-centered core outcome set (COS) for lung cancer, to capture the patient perspective of the impact of lung cancer and (novel) treatments using a combination of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments and clinical data as a means to drive value-based health-care.


Material and methods
An international, expert team of patient representatives, multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, academic researchers and pharmaceutical industry representatives (n=17) reviewed potential outcomes generated through literature review. A broader group of patients/patient representatives (n=31), healthcare professionals / academic researchers (n=83), pharmaceutical industry representatives (n=26), and health authority representatives (n=6) participated in a Delphi study. In two survey rounds, participants scored the relevance of outcomes from a preliminary list. The threshold for consensus was defined as70% of participants scoring an outcome as highly relevant. In concluding consensus-meeting rounds, the expert multidisciplinary team finalized the COS.


Results
The preliminary list defined by the core group consisted of 102 outcomes and was prioritized in the Delphi procedure to 64. The final lung cancer COS includes: 1) case-mix factors (n=27); 2) PROs related to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (n=25); 3) clinical outcomes (n=12). Patient-reported symptoms beyond domains included in the ICHOM lung cancer set in 2016 were insomnia, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, depression, lack of appetite, gastric problems, constipation, diarrhoea, dysphagia, and haemoptysis.


Conclusions
We will implement the lung cancer COS in Europe within the H2O initiative by collecting the outcomes through a combination of clinician-reported measures and PRO measures. The COS will support the adoption and reporting of lung cancer measures in a standardized way across Europe and empower patients with lung cancer to better manage their health care.

Abstract

Background and Aims
Standardising health outcome measurements supports delivery of care and enables data-driven learning systems and secondary data use for research. As part of the Health Outcomes Observatory [H2O] initiative, and building on existing knowledge, a core outcome set [COS] for inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] was defined through an international modified Delphi method.


Methods
Stakeholders rated 90 variables on a 9-point importance scale twice, allowing score modification based on feedback displayed per stakeholder group. Two consecutive consensus meetings were held to discuss results and formulate recommendations for measurement in clinical practice. Variables scoring 7 or higher by80% of the participants, or based on consensus meeting agreement, were included in the final set.


Results
In total, 136 stakeholders (45 IBD patients [advocates], 74 health care professionals/researchers, 13 industry representatives, and four regulators) from 20 different countries participated. The final set includes 18 case-mix variables, three biomarkers [haemoglobin to detect anaemia, C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin to detect inflammation] for completeness, and 28 outcomes (including 16 patient-reported outcomes [PROs] and one patient-reported experience). The PRO-2 and IBD-Control questionnaires were recommended to collect disease-specific PROs at every contact with an IBD practitioner, and the Subjective Health Experience model questionnaire, PROMIS Global Health and Self-Efficacy short form, to collect generic PROs annually.


Conclusions
A COS for IBD, including a recommendation for use in clinical practice, was defined. Implementation of this set will start in Vienna, Berlin, Barcelona, Leuven, and Rotterdam, empowering patients to better manage their care. Additional centres will follow worldwide.

Abstract
Objectives
The objective was to identify candidate patient reported outcomes with potential to inform individual patient care and service development for inclusion in a digital outcome set to be collected in routine care, as part of an international project to enhance care outcomes for people with diabetes.


Methods
PubMed, COSMIN and COMET databases were searched. Published studies were included if they recommended patient reported outcomes that were clinically useful and/or important to people with diabetes. To aid selection decisions, recommended outcomes were considered in terms of the evidence endorsing them and their importance to people with diabetes.


Results
Twenty-seven studies recommending 53 diabetes specific outcomes, and patient reported outcome measures, were included. The outcomes reflected the experience of living with diabetes (e.g. psychological well-being, symptom experience, health beliefs and stigma) and behaviours (e.g. self-management). Diabetes distress and self-management behaviours were most endorsed by the evidence.


Conclusions
The review provides a comprehensive list of candidate outcomes endorsed by international evidence and informed by existing outcome sets, and suggestions for measures.


Practice implications
The review offers evidence to guide clinical application. Integrated measurement of these outcomes in care settings holds enormous potential to improve provision of care and outcomes in diabetes.

Abstract

Objective
Standardised person-reported outcomes (PRO) data can contextualise clinical outcomes enabling precision diabetes monitoring and care. Comprehensive outcome sets can guide this process, but their implementation in routine diabetes care has remained challenging and unsuccessful at international level. We aimed to address this by developing a person-centred outcome set for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, using a methodology with prospects for increased implementability and sustainability in international health settings.


Methods
We used a three-round questionnaire-based Delphi study to reach consensus on the outcome set. We invited key stakeholders from 19 countries via purposive snowball sampling, namely people with diabetes (N=94), healthcare professionals (N=65), industry (N=22) and health authorities (N=3), to vote on the relevance and measurement frequency of 64 previously identified clinical and person-reported outcomes. Subsequent consensus meetings concluded the study.


Results
The list of preliminary outcomes was shortlisted via the consensus process to 46 outcomes (27 clinical outcomes and 19 PROs). Two main collection times were recommended: (1) linked to a medical visit (e.g. diabetes-specific well-being, symptoms and psychological health) and (2) annually (e.g. clinical data, general well-being and diabetes self management-related outcomes).


Conclusions
PROs are often considered in a non-standardised way in routine diabetes care. We propose a person-centred outcome set for diabetes, specifically considering psychosocial and behavioural aspects, which was agreed by four international key stakeholder groups. It guides standardised collection of meaningful outcomes at scale, supporting individual and population level healthcare decision making. It will be implemented and tested in Europe as part of the H2O project.

AbstractSustainable health care systems should be focused on outcomes instead of reimbursing for the services provided. Critical levers for accelerating this are patient engagement and a more comprehensive, standardized collection of patient outcomes. Also, more expertise is required on how these data can best be incorporated into the care process. The Innovative Medicines Initiative project, a public-private partnership in the European Union, has launched Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O), a multi-jurisdictional ecosystem to incorporate patient-reported and other health outcomes into health care decision-making across Europe. This initiative will initially focus on diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease, evaluating and selecting meaningful outcome standards in a way that ensures broad acceptability among all stakeholders. H2O will provide digital tools for patients and implement a state-of-the-art governance system that gives patients autonomy to control their data flows and allows for ethical data sharing, while enabling value-based care and driving better outcomes for patients.

H2O Consortium.  White Paper. 2023.


Executive SummaryHealthcare systems face unprecedented pressures around the globe. Ageing populations, shortages of healthcare professionals and funding restrictions are creating a threefold set of strains on our healthcare systems. If we want these systems to be sustainable, we must focus our healthcare resources on results.
When it comes to health, patient outcomes must be considered the most important Key Performance Indicator (KPI). This may sound obvious but it is not. Tracking patients outcomes can be complicated. It requires standardisation of the outcomes to be measured and innovative technologies to smoothen the process.
The Health Outcomes Observatories (H2O) are focused on creating a common language to allow patients and physicians to share standardised insights on outcomes. This common language enables patients to articulate what matters most to them, improves the communication between patients and physicians and can enable joint decision-making in healthcare.
Better knowledge of patient outcomes and improved communication between patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) can enhance health outcomes and enable the optimal allocation of healthcare resources to where these can have the greatest impact.
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are foundational to this common language. These are PROs that can be monitored by patients without any intervention by healthcare professionals (HCPs). To do this, patients rely on digital technologies and thats why building a trusted digital ecosystem has been a critical part of H2Os work.
At the same time, by leveraging digital technologies and focusing on creating a trusted digital ecosystem, H2O enables pseudonymised, secure and interoperable PRO data to be accessible across countries. Broader and deeper pools of health data can significantly increase the insights drawn from statistical analysis. H2Os standardisation of health data is therefore a powerful tool that can strengthen both medical research and health policy decision-making.
The H2O initiative has already established a number of National Observatories. And the door is open to more! The more countries that join, the deeper the insights that can be gained. In this White Paper, we describe in detail the benefits that the H2O approach can bring and warmly encourage the setting up of more Observatories in other European countries.

Public DeliverablesWP1  Governance, Sustainability & Capabilities 

D1.1 Observatory business architecture The observatory business architecture outlines the initial design of the national and umbrella observatories, together with the principles behind that design. The business architecture covers organizational matters and is complementary to the technical architecture for the observatory network.
The six components of the business architecture include: the mission statement and governance principles; the legal structure for the formation of the observatories and the network of observatories; a summary of the first version of the data management plan; the organizational characteristics of the observatories; and an outline of the approach for the observatories to be sustained beyond the IMI funding period.


D1.2 Data Management PlanThis document is the first version of the Data Management Plan Deliverable 1.1 of the IMI H2O project. This version (v1.0) of the DMP will focus primarily on intended developments in the first half of the project, up to and including the setting up of the European and National Observatories as legal entities, though it will note developments that are expected to occur in the rest of the project or developments that are anticipated for entities that continue after the project is complete. Possible issues with this later work will be noted, but not necessarily explored in depth.


D1.3 Bylaws of the Patient Advisory BoardsH2O is a strategic partnership between the public and private sectors to create a robust data governance and infrastructure model to collect and incorporate patient outcomes at scale into healthcare decision making at an individual and population level. It aims to support better health outcomes by creating and implementing an unprecedented, standardised data governance and infrastructure system across Europe to incorporate patients experiences and preferences in decisions affecting their health care. The public and private sectors have partnered to launch the H2O project to deliver a positive impact across the health care ecosystem by enhancing health research prospects, promoting the development of new treatments that reflect outcomes reported by patients and sustaining more efficient healthcare systems.
The aim of deliverable D1.3  Bylaws of the Patient Advisory Boards  is to lay the foundation of patient involvement in H2O project, set the terms of reference and recommend principles for the selection and engagement of patients and patient representatives in the three disease-specific Patient Advisory Boards (PABs). Furthermore, this deliverable will present the most important operational and governing sides of the three boards within the disease-specific work packages, propose potential activities and timelines, and finally, highlight good practices for patient co-creation across all relevant aspects of the H2O projects activities.


D1.4 KPIs and success metricsDeliverable 1.4 describes the set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and success metrics that meet the H2O projects mission and ambition. Measuring and monitoring these KPIs will be responsible for ensuring that the project, its implementation and deployment and the outcomes evidence generated are of a high and trustworthy quality.
We defined a set of KPIs, in collaboration with all work packages (WPs), for monitoring the progress and success per WP and for the project as a whole to ensure sustainability (linking this deliverable closely with the work done in WP6 which focuses on implementation and sustainability). Some of the KPIs directly refer to deliverables specified in the Grant Agreement. It should prioritise the success metrics, according to the governing principals and taking into account the projects mission.


D1.5 H2O information governance and ethics frameworkThis document describes the Information Governance Framework for the H2O project, including the establishment of the Health Outcomes Observatories. Information Governance is considered to be a broad term covering data protection, confidentiality and ethics as well as high-level elements of information security, which are required when considering the appropriate processing of healthcare data for public benefit.
The document describes a number of instruments which will be needed as part of this framework as well as how these are linked to other project deliverables. It builds on the earlier deliverable, D1.2 Data Management Plan v1.


D1.6 Leaflets explaining PROs in lay termsImportance of Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) has been widely recognized and firmly emphasized on across different stakeholders in healthcare systems around the world. Governments have acknowledged the need to integrate the patient perspective to improve quality of healthcare at individual, organisation, and system level. Furthermore, there is a clear political commitment to patient-/person-centred healthcare today. Patients should also insist that health systems do more than just collect data  after all, answering PROMs (patient-reported outcome measures  the tools used to measure and collect data on PROs), requires time and effort from patients just so the data collected should be put to good use to make real improvements and most importantly address their needs. Unlike standard clinical outcomes, PROs give patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) unique insights into how a therapy can affect a patient, hence their significance will continue to grow.


D1.7 Stakeholder value propositions and sustainability success factorsH2O is constructing a novel European network for the collection and analysis of Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs). Its data will be rich in patient-collected outcomes, offering unique insights that can benefit patients and many other health system and research stakeholders. Its success critically depends on winning support for the collection of outcomes by patients and combining this data with clinician created health data (EHR data) to put the outcomes in their care pathway context. This data has to be of high quality, interoperable and permitted for distributed analysis at regional, national and European levels. Multi-stakeholder support is vital for this.
H2O distinguishes:

stakeholders who capture the health data (such as patients and health professionals), permit the use by H2O of data they each have control over, and its sharing for distributed analysis, and who therefore provide H2O with its main data product
stakeholders who would be willing to pay for data access and use, or pay for H2O to perform analyses for them, and would provide the financial underpinning of the H2O ecosystem
endorsing and enabling stakeholders such as health care providers, health authorities and regulators whose permission or support are essential for H2O acceptance and success
technology providers who may co-invest in the H2O national infrastructures, the European infrastructure and patient apps

Value propositions and value chains have to be articulated and promoted across all of these stakeholder groups. This deliverable builds on the initial analysis of stakeholders and their value propositions published in an earlier deliverable 6.12. It focuses on proposing a methodology for elaborating and maintaining value propositions, and has provided several examples of arriving at such propositions, through employing Value Propositions Canvases (VPCs) and populating them based on what we have learned so far. The deliverable consolidates these learnings through the various stakeholder interactions, which have taken several forms. Success factors that H2O needs to ensure it achieves, from the perspective of the stakeholders we have engaged with have been also formalized as an initial list, which will be maintained and enriched as we progress through more engagements. Compliance statements to indicate how H2O is responding to each success factor will be also added.
Value Proposition Canvases are typically created during f2f interaction with multi-disciplinary project groups. This has not been possible to carry out under the restrictions of the pandemic; rather discussion took place in the framework of setting up the national Observatories, following general guidelines within WP6. Four canvases were then completed by the authoring group, following interviewing and extracting information from the country lead reports as well as industry representatives from within the consortium at this stage of the project (with external stakeholders to be consulted later), to enrich and optimise the initially elaborated set of propositions. The remaining canvases are to be completed collaboratively through a series of virtual workshops and in pace with progress in the project. This part of the work is an internal, consortium level exercise. Once these canvases have been developed as internal drafts, they will be presented and discussed with external stakeholders, both on the data supply and the data demand side, to ensure that they reflect needs and aspirations of stakeholders across Europe.
The deliverable therefore also proposes a process and a roadmap for completing the full array of canvases and for validating them with the most important customer segments of H2O. Specifically, it proposes the creation of a dedicated Value Propositions project group, to be nested within the broader Design Group foreseen in the GA under T1.2. and validation strategies to be undertaken.
Value Propositions are at the heart of the H2O business model and as such they cannot and should not be viewed in isolation, but rather as an integral part of it. At the present stage, the H2O business model has not been formalised, although several aspects of it are being discussed and the main hoped-for income streams have been articulated. The outlook and next steps also recommend the launching of business modelling activities in co-operation with the Erasmus project partner who has responsibility for the next deliverable in this chain of reports, on business models.




WP2  Technical Infrastructure and Interoperability

D2.1 Assessment of the Local and National SituationThe main aim of Work Package 2 (WP2) of H2O is the design and implementation of the technical architecture of the H2O project, to support data management according to the project vision. This document reports on our assessment of the local and national situation regarding data protection, access to and integration of outcomes data from existing clinical records in the participating hospitals and the TOC, which will pilot the solutions developed and drive the adoption of H2O throughout Europe.


D2.2 Architecture BlueprintThe main aim of Work Package 2 (WP2) of H2O is the design and implementation of the technical architecture of the H2O project, to support data management according to the project vision. This document serves to capture the current planning status, to communicate it within the consortium and with the public and to coordinate it with the parties involved.


D2.3 Core Elements Stakeholder-Centric ReportsThe Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O) project aims to enable a value-based approach in healthcare systems, including the use of patient-reported outcomes in three disease areas (diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and oncology) in four countries (Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain). The Work Package 2 (WP2) of H2O contributes by designing and implementing a technical infrastructure per country (national observatories) as well as on a European level (pan-European observatory). For this, WP2 works in close collaboration with the country teams in order to establish structures fitted to the individual needs per country. The developed technical application should serve patients, physicians, regulators, and researchers to facilitate decision making in various settings.
For the sustainable success of the project, the usefulness of collected and displayed data for clinical care is of prime importance. Any use of secondary data for aggregated analyses on real-world data depends on the acceptance within individual care. The identification of core elements for stakeholder-centric reports is needed to ensure standardization for the various components of the H2O project to facilitate up-take and implementation in routine health care service. Three key elements, i.e. user-centeredness, modularization, standardization led the development of prototypes of stakeholder-centric reports for patients, as well as health care providers.
Patient Interface:
Patient empowerment is enhanced by giving people the possibility to have direct access to their health-related data, and thus to make informed decision-making available to each patient. Within this work stream, the aim was to show possible solutions for patients a) to collect their health-related information most convenient, and b) to develop templates that provide options for how health information may be displayed to the patient to increase adherence. For more life-threatening diseases like cancer, the assumption is that the motivation for patients to provide their health status information is largely based on the conjecture that the provided information is informative for the treating physician. For chronic conditions, like diabetes, other types of motivations to adhere to regular PRO assessments are likely more important. As of today, there is very little evidence on adherence rates to PRO assessments outside clinical studies, and outside academic settings. Based on a preliminary set of PRO variables suggested by the H2O network, we developed an approach including different graphical elements which will be shared publicly to encourage innovation.
Health Care Provider (HCP) Interface:
The design phase for the interface template was built on existing experiences based on long-time research as well as successful examples from commercial ePRO-data capture providers. Both served as a starting point informing discussions with clinical colleagues inside as well as outside academic care settings. The three target conditions, i.e. Oncology, IBD, and Diabetes, are vastly different in many respects relevant for this topic. This includes different e.g. care settings, disease trajectories, and acceptance of PRO measures. Still, some core elements are similar across diseases, allowing a certain level of standardization drawing data from three types of sources: PRO data, lab data, or clinical data. One main conclusion was that a system is required allowing physicians to individually adapt to different clinical and patients needs while still receiving relevant information for informed decision making and aggregated data analyses. Within Task 2.3. an exemplary modular system which will be shared in the public domain was designed for a customized use in a clinical setting. It will become available to all participating H2O sites for their consideration (open source).




WP3  Diabetes

D3.3 Material for education and clinical implementationWP3 aims to sustainably improve diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2) outcomes by integrating psychosocial and health status data with clinical diabetes outcomes in a standardized manner. This has the potential to empower patients, facilitate shared decision-making by patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) and promote a more person-centred treatment. The development of the H2O Diabetes standardized core outcome set was described in deliverable D3.2 and the formulation of technical requirements for collecting and making use of the data was reported in deliverable D3.1. The current deliverable report summarises the development of information and training materials for patients and healthcare professionals intended to facilitate implementation of the Diabetes outcome set at the H2O Tier one clinics.
A task force was set up for this task. We used a co-design approach employing both quantitative and qualitative methods to inform this process. This included a workshop with patient representatives of the Diabetes Patient Advisory Board (PAB), a survey among health professionals working with diabetes patients at the H2O clinics, and structured interviews with Diabetes clinical leads and other important stakeholders needed for implementation, e.g., IT experts and clinic management staff. Furthermore, we closely collaborated with the other disease work packages (i.e., WP4: IBD and WP5: cancer) as well as with the communications team and implementation task force of the H2O project.
Our research activities highlight that patients wished for 1) a leaflet, 2) detailed written information, and 3) an e-learning platform, and healthcare professionals need practical information for implementation as well as scientific evidence on PROs, preferably presented in the form of 1) a webinar, 2) use-cases, and 3) an e-learning platform. Therefore, we developed a patient leaflet and a scientific webinar for HCPs, both in alignment with the other disease-specific work packages. Furthermore, a patient FAQ document and a framework for patient e-learning, as well as use-cases and clinical pathways for HCPs were created. Patient representatives and health professionals were involved during the entire process to ensure high acceptability. All materials were designed with high inclusivity in mind, e.g., we used an online tool to optimize readability (even when visually impaired).
D3.3 presents materials for both people living with diabetes and diabetes care professionals that will support the implementation of the H2O Diabetes outcome set at H2O clinics. It is intended to make all materials available on a common platform (this will initially be the H2O website and in the future a common repository hosted by the Pan-European Observatory). All materials are currently available in English and may be translated according to the needs of the participating clinics.




WP4  Inflammatory Bowel Disease

D4.2 Report on requirements specificationThe goal of the H2O is to improve healthcare health outcomes by collecting, analysing, and utilising standardised clinical and patient-reported outcomes data on a large scale. Appropriate digital solutions and systems need to be developed or optimised to reach the maximum impact and scale desired in the project. Requirements for digital technology selection, adaptation, and development to support data collection must be made in a way that will make H2O available and attractive to a large number of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Moreover, the layout of the reports of the outcomes data should be user-friendly, and enable the interpretation and actionability of the collected data in the clinical care context.
The main objective of this document D4.2 Report on Requirement Specification is to report on specifications for digital technology selection, adaptation, and/or development that are required for the implementation in clinical practice of the inflammatory bowel disease core outcome set defined by the Delphi process (see D4.1). Key aspects required for successful collection and visualisation of outcomes data are described. This document also summarises the results of activities outlined in Task 4.2: qualitative research through focus groups and topic-focused (expert) meetings and workshops. These tasks were implemented in close coordination and cooperation with WP2, WP4 and WP5.
The following areas are included in this document:

Insights from an analysis of selected inflammatory bowel disease digital health solutions
Summary findings from the qualitative research  patient advisory board survey results and focus group discussion
Summary findings from the qualitative research  HCP survey results and focus group discussion



D4.3 Material for clinical implementationWP4 aims to better capture the patient perspective of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the impact of (novel) treatments, through collecting, analysing and disseminating a combination of patient-reported and clinical outcome data, in a standardised way across H2O centres and across a variety of diseases. Recently, an IBD-specific core outcome set was defined through a multi-stakeholder international process (cf. D4.1). It resulted in the selection of 16 PRO domains, as well as various clinical outcomes (cf. D4.1). Eventually, a set of tools and measures to collect PROs has been recommended for use in the implementation of the core outcome set. In the current deliverable, we aim to 1) gain insights from healthcare providers (HCPs) and patient representatives on the content and format of the desired materials intended to support implementation and education on PROs and 2) use these perspectives to adapt existing materials or develop new materials for implementation within H2O in the four clinical centres of the Tier 1 countries, namely Spain (ICS-HUVH), Germany (Charit), Austria (MUW) and The Netherlands (EMC), as well as Denmark (Aarhus University) and Italy (Uni-SR) as future H2O implementation centres.
This effort will align with the other disease work packages in diabetes and cancer as they develop a similar deliverable.
First, a short online survey targeting healthcare professionals was designed to determine the most attractive format and most useful content of supporting material for healthcare professionals. Second, in an effort to map the implementation capability of each countrys clinical centre, individual interviews with clinical leads were conducted. We assessed through these interviews the level of readiness of their respective clinical departments to implement the H2O IBD-specific core outcome sets, building upon already established PROs collection processes. We also identified the foreseeable challenges and potential opportunities that could be encountered within the implementation process of H2O IBD-specific core outcome set in each clinical centre. Eventually, we will catalogue the educational material and resources already available at the four clinical centres in the field of PROs specific to IBD and bundle them into an interactive online collection named Implement H2O for IBD. Finally, based on the knowledge acquired, we will define and develop attractive, suitable and practical educational and informational material for healthcare professionals in the field of PROs specific to IBD such as video, on-demand webinars or E-learning modules. In parallel, we will adapt the patient leaflet and the video for patients developed by the European Patient Forum to the IBD- and the Tier 1 country-specific contexts, including local translation and lay language adaptation in collaboration with patients, and patients organizations from the Patient Advisory Board.
Responses to the HCP survey showed that on demand interactive e-learning tool, offering IBD-type specific information such as a scientific presentation, and use cases would be most desirable to train HCPs on the implementation of PROMs. Therefore, a 30-minute webinar presentation was developed for IBD and later adapted to diabetes and cancer. Patient representatives of the PAB-IBD expressed that they would prefer their preferences as 1) a one-page patient recruitment leaflet; 2) a 2-minute video 3) more detailed information through a specific website. Eventually, the implementation readiness interviews highlighted that all hospitals are engaged in the implementation effort albeit at different stages.
This educational material and recommendations for recruitment will offer healthcare professionals of the four Tier 1 countries an attractive resource that will complement the existing educational material available at their institution and facilitate the routine collection of the H2O core outcome set for IBD in their clinical practice. Furthermore, it will bring awareness to IBD patients as well as to healthcare professionals about the benefit of collecting PROs for improving the treatment and quality of life of IBD patients and eventually support IBD patients recruitment into H2O. To ensure maximal impact and successful implementation of the H2O IBD-specific core outcome set in the four clinical centres of this material, regular feedback from healthcare professionals and patients will be sought and will contribute to the continuous improvement of the format as well as the content of this material.




WP5  Cancer treatments

D5.2 Report on requirements specificationOne main goal of the Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O) project is to improve health outcomes by collecting, analysing and utilising clinical and patient-reported outcomes data on a large scale in a standardised manner(1). Appropriate digital tools and systems need to be developed to reach the maximum impact and scale desired in the project. Requirements for digital technology selection must be raised, development and adaptation of new functionalities to support data collection must be driven forward in a way that will make H2O accessible and attractive to a large number of cancer patients and health care professionals. Moreover, the layout of the reports of collected data should be designed in a way that is user-friendly and support actions and implementation.
The main objective of this document D5.2 Report on Requirement Specification is to report on specification for digital technology selection, adaptation and/or development that is required for the implementation of the cancer treatment outcome sets defined by the Delphi process (see D5.1). It describes key aspects required for successful collection and presentation of digital cancer-related outcome data. It also summarises the results of activities outlined in Task 5.2: qualitative research through focus groups and topic-focused (expert) meetings and workshops. These tasks were implemented in close coordination and cooperation with WP2, WP3 and WP4.
The lead beneficiary of this Deliverable is IKNL. NVS took leads drafting the landscaping analysis. In addition, one European-level focus group discussion was organised with the oncology Patient Advisory Board coordinated by the EPF.
The following areas are included in this document:

Insights s from a digital landscape analysis of major smartphone apps used in oncology care and management
Summary reports of topic-focused meetings and workshops organised among the H2O partners
Summary findings from the qualitative research with patients and HCPs (focused group discussions)



D5.3 Report on educational strategies and materialWP5 aims to better capture the patient perspective of cancer and the impact of (novel) treatments, through collecting, analysing and disseminating a combination of patient-reported and clinical outcome data, in a standardised way across H2O centres and across a variety of cancers. We have prioritised lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer as use cases for the development and clinical implementation of core outcome sets, which allows us to build on these processes and expand to additional cancer types gradually. The development of the two outcome sets was described in D5.1 and the description of technological requirements was described in D5.2. In the current deliverable, we aim to 1) gain insights from healthcare providers (HCPs) and patient representatives on the content and format of the desired materials intended to support implementation and education on PROs and 2) use these perspectives to adapt existing materials or develop new materials for implementation within H2O.
First, interviews with HCPs already described in D5.2 were re-analysed, this time with the focus to assess readiness for implementation among HCPs. Second, a short survey for HCPs was conducted to assess the needs and wishes for material to implement patient reported outcome measures (PROMs). A workshop with the Patient Advisory Board (PAB) Oncology was organised to brainstorm about the desired educational material on using PROMs for patients. We built upon the generic materials for clinical implementation developed by the European Patient Forum (EPF) and followed a common framework for general information and training materials. We aligned with the Diabetes and IBD work packages that developed similar materials. All materials were further adapted and refined for lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer patients.
Responses to the HCP interviews and surveys showed that an on-demand webinar or e-learning tool, with a seminar-type presentation of max. 30 minutes, including cancer-type specific information, would be most desirable to train HCPs on the implementation of PROMs. Therefore, in alignment with the Diabetes and IBD work packages, two 30-minute webinar presentations were developed for lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer. Patient representatives of the PAB-oncology expressed that they would prefer 1) a one-page leaflet for patient recruitment; 2) a 1015-minute podcast with an HCP to raise awareness on patient reported outcomes (PROs) and H2O; and 3) instruction videos to educate on specific topics. Because of similar needs in the Diabetes and IBD work packages, members of the disease-specific work packages (DSWPs) and the communications team collaborated to condense a previously developed leaflet by EPF into a simplified one-page leaflet. A H2O podcast was developed following the EPF framework for developing podcasts on their platform.
D5.3 provides the groundwork for clinical implementation of the core outcome sets for lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer within H2O. All materials will be available in English and can be translated into several languages for implementation in participating centres in tier one countries.




WP6  Observatory Management  Communications & Analysis

D6.1 Overarching Operational Plans for National ObservatoriesThe scope of this deliverable is to describe an overarching operational plan for the four National Observatories (NO). The overarching operational plan for the NOs contains a general description of the main actions required for the deployment and operational functioning. This deliverable describes on a high level the necessary capabilities and the main tasks that the national observatories will implement.


D6.2 Operational Plan for each National ObservatoryThe scope of this deliverable is to describe operational plans containing actions and activities required for the setup, deployment and functioning of the four National Observatories within H2O. The deliverable describes the necessary capabilities and the main tasks that the National Observatories will implement. The operational plans cover the 12-month period from April 2022 to Mar 2023 (and include activities planned after that, where appropriate).


D6.3 Operational Plan for the Pan-European Umbrella ObservatoryThis deliverable describes the operational plan for the Pan-European Umbrella H2O Observatory (EUO).
The EUO will coordinate the H2O effort at the European level and ensures standardization as well as interoperability across NOs. More specifically, the EUO will be able to conduct multi-country analysis of this outcomes data across several jurisdictions through federated access to the data from the NOs and serve as a common repository for reports, analytical tools and educative materials to make it available to the respective stakeholders of the health eco-system.
To achieve its mission, the EUO will strive to ensure harmonization and standardization of outcomes data, the patient reported outcomes (PROs) and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) used in clinical care within the NO community with the clear intent to adopt a common standardised language for patients and HCPs and to pave the way towards value based health care. Furthermore, it will promote wide-scale adoption of outcomes, and the value of outcomes data for a diversity of purposes, such as health care decision, health policy, drug development or digital health innovation. Eventually, it will offer outcomes related products and services. Finally, the EUO will be a catalyst for the future growth of the network of NOs.


D6.4 Repository of use cases of the ObservatoriesThis deliverable outlines the potential multipurpose value of the H2O National Observatory (NO). The purpose of this document is to make an inventory of use cases, in order to show what value the NOs could bring. For example; how the H2O NO might create value for patients, healthcare providers, private sector and to the society. This will lead to examples to show the range of practical implications and promote their adoption. We aim to do this in two ways; 1) by choosing existing use cases that have a strong basis and longer existence with a broader patient population in a country, 2) by making assumptions and placing questions that are still unanswered on a disease population level. The latter exercise will be continued after submitting the deliverable. In order to compare the use cases in the different countries, identify strong assets in knowledge and geographic coverage and eventual gaps, we will follow up the developments in the countries on the use cases with a working group from this deliverables group. It will take more time to analyse all use cases and create insights which questions have been answered and which ones still needs effort to answer.


D6.5 First annual report on the progress and success of the observatoriesThis deliverable (D6.5) builds on the Health outcomes observatory (H2O) National Observatory Plan for each Observatory in D6.2 and provides an updated progress report for each National Observatory including successes, hurdles, and current status reports covering 2021-2022. It aims to provide a snapshot of the momentary status of the Health Outcomes Observatories.
The document begins with a broad overview of the progress gained in establishing four H2O national observatories, as well as how this progress can be anticipated to support the development of the Pan-European observatory. A review of the successes and hurdles faced by each observatory is presented. Next, the progress of the observatorys collaboration with their local participating centers will be summarized. A reporting around the preparedness and readiness for the observatories functioning (i.e. ability to collect, store and call data) is also curated. Ongoing activities for each of the national observatories were collected and reported on, including the relevance of the pilot projects and feasibility studies.
The pilot projects will assess the data flow, storage, and retrieval from the user perspectives of querying organizations and researchers. The feasibility study will assess the data flow, storage, and retrieval from the patient and HCP user perspectives. There are two essential components, ensuring the H2O observatory works (tech flow validation), and that it works well (usability). Furthermore, updated budgetary considerations are provided in addition to anticipated needs. Finally, an individual status report on observatory progress by country is shown.


D6.12 H2O exploitation and sustainability strategyThis document presents the plan and initial concepts for the H2O sustainability roadmap. Sustainability is vital for the H2O Observatory network and needs careful planning because of the innovative nature of the ecosystem it is creating. This innovation focuses on providing the capability for multiple stakeholders to gain insights relating to health outcomes that can inform decision-making across a broad scale ranging from individual patients through to multinational policy-setting organisations like the WHO and OECD, spanning direct care to individuals, care planning and optimisation, public health and health strategy, research and health technology innovation.
This document presents an initial qualitative analysis of demand side and supply side perspectives and explains how each of these will be investigated in more detail in the coming months. The sustainability plan will progressively shift from qualitative interview and survey style intelligence gathering to quantitative business modelling in which projected costs and projected revenues will be quantified. At the same time, as the delineation of activities across the national and EU level observatories, in compliance to the Data Governance Act (DGA), will become more and solid, this will allow for precision in the business modelling and the respective cost and revenue calculations.
This deliverable is therefore the start of a process which will continue throughout the project duration and be periodically reported in later deliverables.




WP7  Scientific Coordination & Project Management

D7.1 Project HandbookThe deliverable D7.1 Project Handbook describes the management and administrative procedures and principles that will ensure efficient execution of the H2O project and thus contribute to the production of high-quality project results. As the project evolves further over the next 60 months, the handbook will be updated after its submission on a quarterly basis to ensure that the information is coherent with the development of the project.
The main objective of the Handbook is to provide an understandable and short reference manual that describes the management structure, tasks, decision-making processes, responsibilities and procedures on all levels of the project execution. All the information and general principles in the Handbook were taken from the Grant Agreement, the Description of Action and the Consortium Agreement provisions, but it also draws from best practice, IMI2 rules and accepted project management standards.


D7.2 Project communication plan and initial tool setCrucial to the projects success and its future sustainability is the ability to communicate to external key stakeholders, H2Os vision, objectives, expected impacts and important operational aspects regarding the Observatories. To ensure that all relevant target groups are properly engaged, and key messages properly conveyed in a timely manner and through the right channels and tools, a communication strategy needs to be formulated and a plan outlined. The present document lays down H2Os overall communication policy to achieve maximum efficacy and instill the transformational nature of this project and its value for health care.
All in all, this report will provide a harmonized approach and shared strategy for all partners, whilst outlining a communication plan. This will reflect the communication objectives, roles and responsibilities, target audiences, and activities and tools to support their implementation in a timely basis and in line with the projects budget. An initial set of communication materials which is already being developed, will also be described.


D7.3 Scientific Publication PlanPeer-reviewed publications and presentations on conferences are essential to establish credibility and show thought leadership in the scientific community. The deliverable D7.3 Scientific Publication Plan outlines the Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O) projects planned efforts to support and promote scientific publications and presentations at conferences. It details current and anticipated research activities at the time of submission (M12; September 2021) and their associated dissemination through publication and/or presentation. This document will be updated and supplemented as needed with specific publication tactical plans over the duration of the project.
The main objective of this document is to provide a guideline and reference for the scientific dissemination of H2Os results. It complements the efforts of the Work Packages and the project deliverables, ensuring that project results are disseminated to their fullest potential.

EORTC and H2O team up for better standardized collection of Patient-Reported Outcomes across Europe22nd April 2024/in  /by The Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer () are delighted to announce a new collaboration to help defining the framework for standardized collection of Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) in the scope of the H2O project and ultimately support the shared efforts towards patient-centric healthcare.
PROs play a crucial role in shaping the future of healthcare, offering valuable insights into patients health, quality of life, and functional status. They are usually collected by using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), tools such as questionnaires that patients are asked to fill in and measure clinical aspects of health. By including a patients perception of its symptoms, quality of life, lack of access to treatment and medicines and more, the patients voice is getting heard and valued. At the same time, it is key to standardize the collection measures to ensure its usability for clinicians, researchers, and the patients themselves.
Drawing upon EORTCs largely recognized PROMs and H2Os mission to integrate PROs into healthcare decision-making processes, this partnership promises to facilitate the adoption of standardized PRO collection methodologies, making data collection and access for researchers all over Europe easier and with that improving healthcare for patients.

Leading European Hospitals are embarking on a patient-centric way of providing health care in their clinical practice10th November 2023/in  /by Members of the European University Hospital Alliance (EUHA) are rolling out H2O outcome sets to collect patient-reported outcomes in a standardized way
The IMI-funded initiative Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O), focused on collecting Real World Evidence (RWE) and putting the patients in the center, has been a priority project for EUHA over the last years. Together, we have defined standards for collecting patientreported outcomes and testing them in the clinical day-to-day. What has been a vision for long, is now becoming reality as the project is entering the implementation phase.
Among the first to implement H2O outcome sets are the Charit Universittsmedizin Berlin and the Medical University of Vienna. Already two clinics within Charit  in the area of IBD and diabetes  are using the so-called H2O pragmatic sets, aiming at keeping the effort
around the collection process itself as low as possible, for patients and clinicians.
We know that the standardized collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) will only work on the long run if both patients and doctors dont see it as a burden but as added value. This is how the pragmatic outcome sets are designed and this is how we believe it can work sustainably in the clinical day-to-day., says Prof. Dr. Matthias Rose, Head of the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine at Charit.
Also, the Medical University Vienna has started to use the H2O outcome sets in their diabetes clinic for collecting PROs. A major milestone not only for patients and clinicians, but also for researchers all over the world.
From a research perspective, with better access to large, standardized data sets that bring patient-reported and clinical outcomes together we can create a stronger evidence base for healthcare decision-making at all levels., says Univ.-Prof. Dr. Tanja Stamm, H2O scientific coordinator, Head of the Institute for Outcomes Research, Deputy Director of the Center for Medical Data Science at MedUni Vienna and Head of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Arthritis and Rehabilitation.
What two of the leading hospitals in Europe started only marks the beginning of the implementation phase of the H2O project. With Vall dHebron Barcelona University Hospital in Spain, Erasmus MC in the Netherlands, University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium, Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, Kings College Hospital in the United Kingdom and San Raffaele Hospital in Italy, more EUHA members are in the starting block to follow and make real-world evidence-based decision making and patient empowerment in healthcare a reality.

The H2O Whitepaper is out5th October 2023/in ,  /by Read more about the power of patient-reported outcomes, benefits to patients, a practical model for secure data governance and systemic impact on healthcare in Europe in one comprehensive document.
Healthcare systems face unprecedented pressures around the globe. Ageing populations, shortages of healthcare professionals and funding restrictions are creating a threefold set of strains. If we want these systems to be sustainable, we must focus our healthcare resources on results. When it comes to health, patient-reported outcomes must be considered the most important performance indicator. This may sound obvious, but it is not. Tracking patients outcomes can be complicated. It requires standardisation of the outcomes to be measured and innovative technologies to smoothen the process.
We at H2O are focused on creating a common language to allow patients and HCPs to share standardised insights on outcomes. Better knowledge of patient-reported outcomes and improved communication between patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) can enhance health outcomes and enable the optimal allocation of healthcare resources to where these can have the greatest impact.
In our latest Whitepaper we showcase how the power of patient-reported outcomes can be harnessed to improve patient outcomes, and equally importantly, create synergies across healthcare systems. Digital health is the enabler we need to improve healthcare across the board.

Germany launches H2O Observatory28th September 2023/in  /by H2O now also in Germany: The German National Observatory officially launches
Berlin, 28.09.2023  Yet another observatory opened up under the IMI-funded H2O umbrella. Also in Germany diverse stakeholders from the private and public sector have joined forces to establish a national Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O e.V.).
Controlled by patients, real-world findings will be collected in a practical manner  including the experiences of patients. Like at the other national observatories of H2O, data will be collected in a uniform way to improve communication between patients and physicians, and to make research results more usable.
H2O e.V. starts at a time when discussions about the renewal of the health care system in Germany are at a peak. Debates about the planned hospital reform, the electronic health record and the rising costs for the statutory health insurance show the need for change. The German offshoot of H2O could contribute to solving these problems. It was founded by a consortium of respected partners who are committed to positive change in the health care system. Founding members include:

Jan Brnneke, project lead BWI  IT fr Deutschland GmbH
Dagmar Kownatka, former Head of Healthcare Transformation & Value Based Health Care, Roche Diabetes Care GmbH
Lisa Otto, H2O project manager, Charit Center for Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (CPCOR)  Charit Universittsmedizin Berlin
Aliz Rogge, H2O project manager, CPCOR  Charit Universittsmedizin Berlin
Matthias Rose, H2O Chair, Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Charit Universittsmedizin Berlin
Ariel Stern, Assistant Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School, Visiting Professor Digital Health Economics and Policy, Hasso-Plattner-Institute
Susanne Weinbrenner, Senior Physician & Head, Social Medicine and Rehabilitation Division, Federal German Pension Fund (DRV-Bund)
Brbel Shlke, Board of Directors, Zielgenau, Patient-Association Lung Cancer

We are pleased to announce the launch of H2O e.V. in Berlin, said Jan Brnneke, project manager at BWI  IT for Germany GmbH. By bringing together different experts and stakeholders, we aim to create a platform that drives meaningful change and ultimately improves patient outcomes.
Matthias Rose of Charit added: H2O is one of the smartest initiatives Ive seen. It is also considered one of the first pilot projects to show how the European Health Data Space (EHDS) can work in practice.
Brbel Shlke of the patient organisation Zielgenau complemented: H2O e.V. will collaborate with leading research institutions, healthcare organizations and public institutions. The goal is to promote standardization of patient-reported outcomes, knowledge exchange and collaboration. The observatory will play an important role in generating evidence that can help health policies and strategies adapt to changing needs.

STRENGTHENING THE PATIENT VOICE IN HEALTH CARE


The Health Outcomes Observatory project (H2O) brings together the public and private sectors to create an unprecedented, standardised data governance and infrastructure system across Europe to incorporate patients experiences and preferences in decisions affecting their individual health care and those of the entire patient community.
With H2O infrastructure and tools, patients will be able to measure their outcomes in a standardised way, whilst keeping full control of their data. Ultimately, this framework of Observatories aims to foster innovation in health care in Europe and beyond todeliver better outcomes for all.




H2O vision



Data governed and managed by the Health Outcomes Observatories will be accessed by patients and their health care providers to promote a richer and fruitful dialogue between patient and health care professionals based on meaningful information.
H2O aims to create a robust data governance model that gives patients control of their data and enables ethical, secure analysis of the data when patients consent to this, in the interest of society, science and patient care. Standardised and structured health data will be available for analysis in order to:

enhance health research prospects
promote the development of new treatments that reflect outcomes reported by patients
sustain more efficient healthcare systems

There are various THC detox treatments available, including home cures. A natural cleanse will take the most time, but it will be the most effective and comprehensive detox method.
Most natural detoxification procedures are simple to implement and may be used in tandem to achieve the optimum effects. Making these adjustments, whether in detox mode or not, can lead to healthy living patterns.
Detoxification is one of the most important ways to prepare your body for a painless drug test. However, in order to completely detoxify and prepare your body, you must first understand how most drug tests work.
THC Detox beverages are promoted for their capacity to temporarily flush THC out of the body on the  of ingestion. Most detox beverages only work for a few hours. Nonetheless, these detox beverages might enhance your body's natural detoxification process.
A drug test may be dumped on you abruptly, leaving you with no time to cleanse your system before the test. In such case,  to pass a urin drug test is to use synthetic urine to pass the test.
Assume you're a light marijuana user with a thin layer of marijuana metabolite concentration in your hair and scalp. In that situation, apple cider vinegar may aid in your drug test successNewsletter
