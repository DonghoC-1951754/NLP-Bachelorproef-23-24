Welcome to the UK Health Data Research Alliance  an independent alliance of leading healthcare and research organisations united to establish best practice for the ethical use of UK health data for research at scale.
Five years of partnership and impact from the UK Health Data Research Alliance (image credit: Nada Karrar).
Our mission
Our mission is to is to accelerate improvements in biomedicine, health and care by encouraging widespread and responsible use of health-relevant data in a trustworthy, ethical way for research and innovation.
This is based on three goals:

We also aim to achieve international recognition and influence as a network that enables and demonstrates trustworthy use of health-related data for research and innovation.
Our Work
We enable health data research by developing and driving adoption of standards, tools, processes, capabilities and information governance approaches.
The Alliance does this by bringing expert communities together to drive consensus around best practice and publishing recommendations and papers.
Our focus is on:

Trust and Transparency  Ensuring communities contribute to streamline and simplify data access while earning public trust in the use of data.
Technology Services  Building a cross-sector community to co-develop technologies and tools for research data infrastructure.
Data Standards  Developing standards and facilitating adoption of existing standards for interoperability and usability of data and seeking agreements on best practice for data curation, management and analysis.
Capacity Building  Identifying skills gaps in the healthcare sector and influencing changes for improving education and professional development.


Our Principles for Participation
We have a growing membership of more than 100 leading research and healthcare organisations from all four UK nations.
Organisations involved in the Alliance, or its programmes, sign up to nine principles agreeing to:

Demonstrate active and ongoing engagement with patients and the public.
Encourage the availability and use of health and care data for research and innovation that serves public interest.
Promote the protection of privacy and data security, including providing access to sensitive data through Secure Data Environments.
Make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) by adopting the  guidelines.
Take a proportionate approach to data access governance based on the  framework.
Maximise the benefits for research and innovation through non-preferential access to data.
Establish mutually beneficial ways of working in partnership.
Work collaboratively to increase harmonisation and reduce the complexity of data sharing arrangements.
Contribute to a joined-up, UK-wide offer for researchers.


Our Structure
The Alliance is convened by Health Data Research UK. Set up in 2019, it has been established as a member-led network of partners with a robust governance structure designed to be effective, inclusive and transparent.
The main elements are:


Our Impact
Our impact and influence are extensive and growing. Achievements in our first five years included:
   recommending guidelines for data sharing and linkage practice within TREs (also known as Secure Data Environments or SDEs) established the blueprint for trustworthy data access, linkage and research. Its influence on Data Access Policy within the NHS is seen in publications and implementation guidance.
   for improving transparency in the use of health data have led to a rise in the number of custodians publishing information on how their datasets are used, by whom and for what purpose.
  Our members agree to adopt the FAIR principles for data management and stewardship when joining. Most data custodians in the Alliance, now publish metadata on , which serves as a portal for data discovery and access. NHS England has also pledged to use the Gateway as the single front door for the .

Work with us
We are striving to broaden our membership among health data research stakeholders and to deepen and strengthen existing partnerships.

Our History
The UK Health Data Research Alliance was established in February 2019, as a member-led network of data providers, custodians and curators to accelerate improvements in biomedicine, health and care by encouraging widespread and responsible use of health-relevant data in a trustworthy, ethical way for research and innovation.
It took inspiration from other global alliances, such as the  and the  who unite international communities to develop frameworks and standards around best practice.
The Letter of Intent
The Alliance constitution is set out in the  signed by all organisations joining the Alliance. The Letter outlines the background of the Alliance, the founding and operating principles and the composition and governance of the Alliance.
The  of the Alliance provide a framework of collaborative and open working practices, drawing from national and international best practice frameworks and recommendations, including the  for scientific data management and the Five Safe framework.

Alliance consultation and change to governance
In March 2023, a full review of the Alliance governance was carried out by the secretariat, along with an extensive consultation with Alliance members and partners. Following this, several key changes were approved by the Board:

Alliance membership extended to non-data custodians complementary groups and organisations, such as Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement groups, Industry Trade Associations, funders, regulatory bodies.
An Alliance Executive Committee representative of the membership was established.
The Alliance Board and associated convening role will be maintained through an Alliance Council.
The Alliance  and  will continue to underpin the Alliance ethos and will be updated to reflect the agreed changes.

The UK Health Data Research Alliance (the Alliance) is an independent alliance of leading healthcare and research organisations united to establish best practice for the ethical use of UK health data for research at scale.
Its members include organisations representing national organisations, NHS trusts, research institutes and charities.

Together the members offer an exceptional opportunity to provide access to rich and diverse health data for research and innovation, in particular via the . Research based on data that reflects diversity of culture, healthcare conditions and aspects such as race, ethnicity, gender and age improves the ability to generalise results and enables new discoveries and understanding about disease. In turn this provides fairer and more equal access to the latest treatments and medical technologies, benefiting as many people across the UK as possible.
By working in partnership, the members of the Alliance are developing and co-ordinating the adoption of tools, techniques, conventions, technologies, and designs that enable the use of health data in a trustworthy and ethical way for research and innovation. The aim is to help researchers to answer some of the most difficult questions and address the most important health challenges faced in the UK.
Senior leaders from partner organisations join the Alliance Council to provide oversight and direction of the Alliance. Alliance Council meetings take place every quarter and are chaired by , HDR UKs Director.

				Trust and Transparency			






 








We are working to harmonise and simplify data access for healthcare research and to earn public trust in the use of their data.
The issues of information governance and public confidence are closely linked and have been brought together by the Alliance in a single Trust and Transparency workstream.
The Challenge
Researchers often state that the difficulty in accessing data is the main barrier to their projects.
Other major obstacles include lack of standardisation and transparency in the access processes and for the use of data.
Tackling this problem would allow faster, better research  speeding up advances in healthcare.
At the same time public involvement needs to be baked into health data research at all levels and stages.
This helps guarantee that research is in the public interest and reassures people that data is being used responsibly and for their benefit.
The Solution
The , which represents data custodians, policymakers and public contributors across the four UK nations, is a sub-group of the Alliance and has been set up to simplify and streamline data access governance processes.
The Steering Group has set up Action Forces around transparency standards, mapping data access processes, developing template contracts for data ingress and data access via Trusted Research Environments (TREs) and exploring the challenges in international data access.

A strategic partnership has been formed with the Public Engagement in Data Research Initiative () to develop and spread public involvement and engagement (PIE) best practice among data custodians. The partnership is focussed on exploring PIE priorities and embedding good practice, addressing resource information gaps for researchers and PIE professionals, listening to the public and acting on their concerns.
Action Forces and working groups
Improving Transparency in Data Use
A data use register (also known as a data release register or list of approved projects) offers the public a clear record of how their data is being used, by whom and for what purpose. In March 2022, the Alliance established a working group to help ensure that clear, consistent and standardised public records are regularly published on data use to demonstrate the value and benefit of using health data.
The group has produced recommendations for a  to be adopted by organisations responsible for the safe sharing of data used for research and innovation.

Transparency Standards for Data Access and Adoption of the Five Safes
Best practice  (co-developed with HDR UKs Public Advisory Board ()) have been published. These offer guidance on providing information to the public and researchers about data access processes. Grants have been awarded to help organisations adopt the standards.
The group  the consultation on Information Commissioners Offices () draft guidance on transparency in the health and social care sector.
Mapping Data Governance Processes
The groups aim is to create a single map of the ethics and governance approvals needed to access administrative and heath data from TREs across the UK.
It has produced a data access map detailing the approvals processes to access data held by Trusted Research Environments () in each of the home nations. There is also a comparison tool showing each step of the access process in more detail and giving access to advice and guidance.
TRE Legal Toolkit
The action force is working to define the data protection roles and responsibilities of all parties involved in TRE data access and to streamline contractual arrangements, so that research in the public benefit is not delayed unnecessarily in the legal review process, whilst robust and standardised controls are upheld.
The aim is to produce a toolkit of template resources to speed up contracting and ensure all parties are aware of their obligations. A paper on the principles underpinning data access has been published and a template  (DAA) is now available.
Five Safes
This action force is promoting the adoption and use of the Alliances Five Safes data access form, which simplifies the data access application process. It works to overcome challenges and provide training on use of the form. It is also developing transparency standards for Alliance members.
International Data Access
This group is focused on the legal challenges relating to international data sharing and its aim is to produce outputs to drive clarity in this area.
For more information about this group and other action forces contact
Using Linked Data for Research
The Alliance organised a series of workshops to address the challenges and opportunities associated with utilising linked data for health research in the UK. These sessions aimed to improve accessibility to linked data, streamline data access processes, and enhance collaborations among stakeholders in the UK health data ecosystem.
Alliance members and other contributors are now working with workshop participants to produce an opinion piece to call out for action to maximise the use of linked data for research, moving towards more streamlined and transparent data access mechanisms, with better guidance, resources, and legal toolkits for researchers.

				Data Standards			






 









Achieving widespread adoption of internationally recognised data standards across the UK is at the core of the Alliances mission.
Data standards are crucial to the success of health data science, providing consistency, comparability and reproducibility across diverse data assets and enabling robust and reliable research across different regions and countries
However, the healthcare, research and data infrastructure is complex and fragmented  frequently lacking common standards and practices.
Our focus is to facilitate the adoption of existing standards, for interoperability and usability of health-related data, only developing new standards where there is a clear unmet need.
We work in collaboration with our members to achieve agreements on, and drive the adoption of, best practices for data curation, management, and analysis.
This is essential to our objective ofmaximising the trustworthy use of health data for the benefit of the public.
Our approach
One of our principal mechanisms for the community development and evaluation ofdata standards is the Data Officers Group, chaired by, Professor of Digital Health, at University of Leeds, honorary consultant in medical oncology at Leeds Teaching Hospitals and Chief Clinical Data Officer at HDR UK.
The Data Officers Group includes representatives from Alliance member and partner organisations across the UK and addresses key challenges in data curation, quality and management  identifying available solutions, and agreeing actions and priorities. There are currently three priority areas of work:

Promoting and enabling adoption of the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model.
:Focusing on recommendations for ethnicity coding standards.
: Exploring data-enabled clinical trials.

The aim of this workstream is to support the convening of a network of technologists across the NHS, academia, policy and industry to align efforts, share tools, collaborate on shared components, drive adoption of recognised standards and accelerate trustworthy data use for research and innovation. This workstream also supports the continued development of the , a portal for data discovery and access.
The Challenge
Despite significant progress in recent years, access to and analysis of health data for research remains a lengthy and fragmented process. There are many technology solutions available to support researchers, including software programmes, tools, scripts, pipelines, platforms, and code, but they are dispersed across many organisations and groups working within this space, and theres often limited sharing and re-use of the solutions developed across the wider community.
The Solution
We are bringing together all these individual components through the convening of a technology ecosystem, embedding a collaborative approach to co-create novel solutions that promote open science and encourage interoperability. This will allow health data science to scale at a greater pace than ever before; transforming how researchers access and analyse health data and enabling them to rapidly deliver patient and public benefit.
The role of the Alliance
One of the Principles for Participation that member organisations agree to when joining the Alliance is adopting the  for scientific data management and stewardship. Alliance members are involved in development of key Gateway functions, as well as providing information on the datasets which can be discovered on the Gateway, and participate in specific initiatives and working groups to inform implementation of policy and technology standards.

: Launched in 2020 as part of the Digital Innovation Hub Programme, the Gateway is a central location to discover health data and other resources vital for research. Alliance members are encouraged to publish metadata on the Gateway, which serves as a portal for dataset discovery and requesting access. Currently, 51% of Alliance members who function as data custodians share their metadata on the Gateway. NHS Englands Data for R&D Programme has pledged to utilise the Gateway as the  for the NHS Research SDE Network. This initiative is expected to further enhance the discoverability and accessibility of NHS data. Contact  to support with testing and co-development of the Gateway.
: One of the most influential outputs of the Alliance to date has been the . This paper established the blueprint for trustworthy data access, linkage and research within the health sector and beyond. The document has been accessed over 11,000 times and its influence, alongside the Goldacre Review, on Data Access Policy within the NHS in England is evident through publications and implementation guidance.
: The Researcher Registry is one of the  which aims to simplify decision-making processes when granting researchers access to sensitive health and administrative data. In line with the  Safe People principle, the aim is for a common standard and consistency across organisations, along with confidence in the accuracy of the data, to reduce the burden for both TREs/SDEs and researchers, enabling simpler, faster, more reliable decision-making. The Alliance is key to the development and wider adoption of the common standard. Contact  to get involved or learn more about this project.
: HDR UK has developed the  as an implementation of the Alliance , to provide a best practice example of how information of approved data uses is shared and managed, and support data custodians to meet the principles of transparency, as outlined in the . To date, over 1000 data uses have been added to the Gateway data use register. Contact  to discuss implementation of the data use register standard.

				Capacity Building			










The Alliance and its members are striving to build capacity in health data research. While there are ongoing initiatives tackling skills gaps in data science, more work is needed to ensure the UK has the skilled and representative workforce it needs to flourish.
There are several Alliance member organisations already involved in capacity-building initiatives, including:

 provides a catalogue of data sources along with essential information that researchers need to know, such as security requirements, use restrictions, access requirements, timescales, to help researchers navigate their way through these factors.
The  aims to improve health outcomes by enabling those who commission, deliver and receive healthcare to measure and improve our healthcare services. They provide an online or , which includes free to use education packages on subjects related to clinical audit and to healthcare quality improvement, and 
 is a leader in educational design, delivery and quality assurance. Utilising the very best in technology enabled learning, organisational and leadership development, workforce and learning analytics and digital development, across the entire health and social care workforce and in every community in Scotland.

The challenge
Health data research faces a serious skills shortage, which hampers the UKs ambition to be a world leader in the field.
The shift from the model of data release to data access via trusted research environments (TREs), has led to a growing demand for building capability to manage TREs, along with an increasing need to carry out federated analyses. There is also a gap in more general data management skills, such as data curation and pseudonymization, which needs to be addressed.
At the same time there is serious under-representation of some socio-economic groups  for example from Black people.
A diverse workforce, representative of the population it serves, is better equipped to carry out the research needed to improve healthcare and encourage innovation.
Health data research is also a new and swiftly developing area, so it is essential to identify and fill skills gaps by providing ready access to high quality learning and training so people can enter the field or progress their careers.
The solution
Capacity Building is a core workstream for the Alliance  with a focus on addressing skills gaps influencing changes for improvement in education and professional development.
Black Internship Programme
We work collaboratively on valuable initiatives like the HDR UK  (BIP), aimed at addressing the skills gap in emerging black data scientists.
Data Scientists
Many Alliance members have acted as BIP hosts, offering paid summer placements that empower talented and motivated people to kickstart their careers. To date, 31% of the Alliance membership have hosted at least one intern.
This joint initiative between the Alliance and HDR UK provides interns with hands on experience in carrying out a practical real-world project. It also gives hosts access to a pool of excellent potential recruits from diverse backgrounds.
If you are interested in becoming a BIP host organisation please contact .
TRE Capabilities
The Alliance is also interested in exploring and identifying the requirements in skills, training and knowledge across TREs and Alliance data custodians to ensure they have the appropriate capability to meet the ongoing challenges and changes to technology in this sector.
Contact us to get involved in shaping this workstream.
Training Courses
Alliance members contribute to the development of the  online training and learning platform, by providing expertise and co-producing useful resources and videos.
HDR UK Futures offers expert-led bite-sized video-based courses in a wide range of subjects, so people can study wherever and whenever they like. Futures along with the other  opportunities (from apprenticeships, internships, scholarships and fellowships to online and in-person courses) enable health data science professionals to continually update their skills and knowledge.
Our members, and their staff, also benefit from a wide range of professional development training and learning events and activities, many are .

				Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust			

					Guy's and St Thomas' provides 2.6 million patient contacts in acute and specialist hospital services and community services every year. As one of the biggest NHS trusts in the UK, with an annual turnover of almost 1.6 billion, we employ around 17,100 staff.				









In 2018/19 we had over 550 studies running across a range of medical conditions,. During 2018/19 over 19,500 people took part in research studies at Guys and St Thomas.
Guys and St Thomas is part of , a collaboration between Kings College London, and Guys and St Thomas, Kings College Hospital and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trusts.
At GSTT, we have several datasets that are available for research. These include Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), and NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC), which are detailed below.
HES is a database containing details of all admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England. Data is collected during a patients time at hospital as part of the Commissioning Data Set (CDS). This is submitted to NHS Digital for processing and is returned to healthcare providers as the Secondary Uses Service (SUS). Each HES record contains a wide range of information about an individual patient admitted to an NHS hospital, including clinical information, patient demographics, administrative information and geographical information.
Benefits of HES datasets include:

monitoring trends and patterns in NHS hospital activity
assessing effective delivery of care
supporting local service planning
providing the basis for national indicators of clinical quality
revealing health trends over time
informing patient choice
determining fair access to health care
developing, monitoring and evaluating government policy
supporting NHS and parliamentary accountability

The HIC brings together all NHS trusts with NIHR Biomedical Research Centres (BRCs) to make NHS clinical data more readily available to NHS trusts and researchers. GSTT leads on the Renal Transplantation theme. This includes capturing clinical, laboratory and demographic data from all patients admitted for a kidney transplant between 1st of January 2005 and onwards, for patients who are over 16 from four BRCs. All data is routinely collected as part of clinical care.
Benefits of HIC datasets are:

More effective use of electronic patient records
Improving the ability to draw comparisons from research and analysis
Making information held easier to find and use
Better opportunities to link with other public organisations, charities, academic organisations and industry to improve patient outcomes.

All data available for research is completely anonymised.

OPCG consists of a team of data scientists, medical scientists, database experts and business systems experts to facilitate improvement in the diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic diseases within primary care. 
Optimum Patient Care Research Database (OPCRD) Summary
The Optimum Patient Care Research Database (OPCRD) is a United Kingdom based real-world, longitudinal research database, which is approved by the NHS HRA Research Ethics Committee (NHS HRA REC ref: 20/EM/0148) to provide anonymised data for research purposes. OPCRD has been in operation for 13 years and currently holds de-identified data for over 19.9 million unique patients, from GP electronic health records from over 1,100 primary care practices. The current number of registered patients actively contributing data to OPCRD is 10.1 million patients, approximately 15% of the current UK population. This data is further enhanced through the collection of patient reported (questionnaire) information collected as part of the OPC quality improvement (QI) and research support services provided as a no-cost service to GP practices in the UK.
OPCRD is also one of the fastest growing UK databases, growing at over 3 million patients per year, with a total of 15.6 million patients added in the past 5 years.

				Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA)			

					The HFEA is the UKs independent regulator of fertility treatment and research using human embryos.				









Set up in 1990 by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, the HFEA is responsible for licensing, monitoring and inspecting fertility clinics to ensure patients and everyone born through fertility treatment receives high quality care. The HFEA is an arms length body of the Department of Health, working independently from Governmentproviding free, clear andimpartial information about fertility treatment, clinicsandegg, sperm and embryo donation. The HFEA is funded by licence fees, IVF treatment fees and a grant from UK central government.
About our data
By law, every fertility clinic in the UK has a duty to submit data to us about fertility treatments taking place and babies born as a result. We hold this data on a secure database known as The Register, which isthe longest running database of its kind in the world. We collect data on more than 70,000 fertility treatments each year, ranging from IVF, to donor insemination, egg freezing and more. We use this data to improve patient care and help researchers to conduct world-class research, whilst protecting the confidentiality of patients.

Peter Thompson, Chief Executive of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, said:
We are delighted to be joining the UK Health Data Research Alliance, and look forward to working with the other Alliance members to help improve research into fertility and ultimately improve patient care. As the UK fertility regulator we hold an unique set of data on our Register, which isthe longest running database of its kind in the world.
There have been many advances in the development of fertility treatment since the birth of the first IVF baby Louise Brown over 40 years ago. Yet, the IVF sector, both in the UK and elsewhere, needs more high quality, evidence-based research to improve outcomes for patients. Being part of the Alliance will make our data much more accessible and allow researchers to look into much needed new developments and issues to improve fertility treatment for the benefit of patients.

				British Regional Heart Study (BRHS)			

					The British Regional Heart Study (BRHS) is a long-term cohort investigating the causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in men and seeking to understand the effect of co-morbidities on CVD & ageing.  				









The BRHS provides a geographically and socially representative cohort for the prospective investigation of CVD in British men spanning over four decades. We are immensely grateful to the BRHS participants, to the BRHS general practices for their continued support, to our collaborators and to the BRHS research team members past and present.
Established in 1978-80, the British Regional Heart Study (BRHS) study has benefited from four repeated assessments of the men at ages in middle (40-59 years) and later life (60-79, 72-91 and 79-98 years). Participants have been followed up for >40 years at four timepoints in middle-age through to very old ages for a wide range of health outcomes, including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity, physical disability and frailty using GP records and participant questionnaires.
This unique ageing cohort with extensive phenotyping, genotyping and detailed follow-up will contribute and allow studying healthy cardiovascular ageing including prevention of CVD, heart failure, stroke, diabetes and related disabilities (frailty, dementia) in older age and to examine other key health outcomes related to CVD and associated with healthy ageing, such as physical function, disability, frailty, dental health, malnutrition and sarcopenia.
Goya Wannamethee, BRHS Director said, The BRHS is delighted to become a member of the Health Data Research Alliance. We are keen to make our research data accessible to researchers so that it can be fully utilized for the study of cardiovascular disease prevention and healthy cardiovascular ageing.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
Where we use certain service providers in countries which have not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we will use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK and Europe. A copy of this can be provided for your review on request to the contact details below.

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. Where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests).

YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, including:

Request access to your personal data(commonly known as a data subject access request). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. 
Request correction of your personal data. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. 
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. 
Object to processing of your personal data. This enables you to object to processing of your personal data if you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if we are using it for direct marketing purposes. 
Request restriction of processing your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in a number of different scenarios, such as where you want us establish the accuracy of the data. .
Request transfer of your personal data. This enables you to request the transfer of your personal data to a third party. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. 
Right to withdraw consent. This enables you to withdraw your consent that we are relying on to process your personal data. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, pleasecontact DataProtection@hdruk.ac.uk. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner, the UKs data protection authority.
