Cofund action under the Horizon Europe Programme designed to support coordinated national and regional research and innovation programmes along with capacity building, networking , dissemination and other key activities to support health and care systems transformation. 

Health and care systems in Europe are facing core common challenges, which require harmonised and coordinated solutions. The European Partnership on Transforming Health and Care Systems (THCS) represents a unique strategic opportunity to bring together stakeholders, create synergies, coordinate Research and Innovation actions, facilitate the digitization of health and care services and support the transformation of health and care systems with innovative solutions driven by knowledge and evidence.

The general objective of the European Partnership on Transforming Health and Care Systems (THCS) is to contribute to the transition towards more sustainable, efficient, resilient, inclusive, innovative and high-quality people-centred health and care systems equally accessible to all people. The idea is to catalyse such transformation by building an open and supporting Partnership where all stakeholders can work together to stimulate and nurture R&I activities.

Furthermore, our systems share challenges that require harmonised and coordinated solutions, devised through a process that allows all stakeholders involved in health and care systems to design, research and implement such issues in a timely manner.Within this context, we need to identify how health and care systems can achieve such harmonised responses. This Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) defines the framework on which the Partnership for transforming health and care systems (THCS) is set to respond to this context, building on its solid background, existing key initiatives in the field, and common vision: to maintain and improve peoples health in Europe and participating countries by supporting the transformation of health and care systems to achieve high-quality, fairly accessible, sustainable, efficient, resilient and inclusive health and care systems for all.To move towards the realisation of its vision, the Partnership will focus on its ambition to address and trigger global and long-term changes in the complex health and care research and innovation ecosystems. More specifically, the objective will be reached by embracing the whole knowledge and innovation cycle, with a specific focus on the need to foster implementation, inform policy and practice, and provide the necessary inputs for improving health and care capacity. This will be achieved through a Partnership in which all stakeholders can work together to stimulate and nurture research and innovation activities.As indicated in Chapter 3 of this SRIA, the achievement of the abovementioned goal will be enshrined in a series of specific objectives to be achieved by 2030: increase funding opportunities and strengthen the research and innovation community; fill knowledge gaps; increase the ability to implement innovation; intensify cooperation among countries and beyond healthcare; and increase stakeholders involvement.These objectives, through a series of specific activities, will seek to deliver clear outcomes. They include: increased engagement of researchers in collaborative research; use of research results to develop evidence-based strategies; implementation of innovative care delivery methods; planning and implementation of efficient investments for novel solutions and models; stronger ecosystems and boosted uptake of innovation; increased digital and health literacy for citizens and professionals; and, ultimately, better cooperation and use of knowledge and evidence across countries. The SRIA also identifies specific impacts for key stakeholder categories, highlighting the concrete improvements the Partnership can bring.Within such a broad and complex topic, prioritisation and framing are essential. Chapter 4 of the SRIA addresses this issue, identifying clear thematic priorities set against frameworks that include efficiency and sustainability, quality and safety, digitalisation, people needs and user involvements, and the health and care workforce. Such frameworks are closely intertwined with the specific health and care sectors demanding attention and change, including long-term care, primary care, and the redefinition of hospital care.Chapter 4 also lays out the Partnership roadmap. This is developed around three overarching work streams that address the specific objectives and describe the ambitious outcomes expected within the agreed time frame: filling knowledge gaps; implementing and transferring solutions; and boosting health and care system capabilities. To progress from these work streams to implementation and results, the SRIA also identifies a tentative roadmap with short-, medium- and long-term objectives linked to expected 2030 results.This leads us to the implementation approach of the Partnership, which is presented in Chapter 5 alongside the organisational structure of the Partnership. In brief, the identification of the problems and challenges to be addressed, together with the definition of any missing knowledge, will help identify the priority topics to be included in the Partnerships Annual Work Plans. Existing practices will need to be regularly mapped to avoid any duplication of efforts, to help tailor the best actions, and to understand context-based obstacles and barriers to implementation and transfer. Addressing research and innovation funding will be a core issue for the Partnership and sustainable mechanisms for the alignment of resources will be promoted.Within this framework, the Partnerships implementation will be guided by a set of principles: joint investments in health and care research and innovation; co-creation, capacity-building and science- policy cooperation across all activities and instruments; the establishment of a knowledge hub for ecosystem development support; international cooperation and broader participation with selected countries in order to compare approaches, test solutions, exploit results, exchange experiences and needs, and support the transfer of knowledge; strategy development to strengthen programme management, dissemination, and exploitation.Finally, as the Partnership's endeavours will not achieve the desired results on their own, the SRIA maps out the main synergies that the Partnership will seek and foster with other EU initiatives, from Horizon Europe to the EU4Health Programme, covering other important partnership and funding streams such as the Innovative Health Initiative and the European Social Fund+.SRIA OverviewExploreDocumentationAuthorsThis Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) was written by the core team of the Transforming Health and Care Systems Candidate Partnership in cooperation with the European Commission (DG RTD, DG CONNECT, DG SANTE).

As such, person- and people-centredness not only requires involving people to explore their needs and become more empowered, but also a system-wide reassessment and redesign of professional orientations and service organisation to adjust to the needs of people and their abilities, rather than the other way around.To address the increasing challenges and fill the knowledge and innovation gaps and specific objectives, it is important to support research and innovation actions addressing all dimensions of health and care systems:Quality of care: safety, effectiveness, patient-centredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity.Accessibility: approachability, acceptability, availability and accommodation, affordability, appropriateness, equity, and one-way entry and navigation in a well-integrated, people-centred and de-siloed system.Sustainability: long-term strategic perspective and innovativeness, disease prevention and health promotion, rehabilitation, quality, financial sustainability, institutionalisation of environmental concerns, and institutional accountability and individual responsibility.Efficiency: cost-effectiveness and value for money.Resilience: knowledge, management of uncertainties, interdependence, legitimacy.Inclusiveness: diversity-sensitive, non-discriminatory, stigma-free.Within the overarching theme of people-centred health and care systems, particular issues are centred around creating conditions that enable people as service users, patients, carers, their families, and communities to play a more central and directing role in their own care as well as in shaping the system that serves them. It also touches upon the implications of personalised medicine for individuals and societies that will have considerable implications for how health and care systems are organised and funded.Several key questions can be considered while focusing on this overarching priority:What are the most effective approaches to engagement that consider peoples values and preferences? These should take into consideration the individual person-professional relationship, the organisation, the co-creation of innovation, the governance and financing, and the wider societal perspective to implementing people-centred strategies.What are the most effective investment strategies for supporting the public (e.g. patients, clinicians, or decision-makers) to acquire the skills and abilities for critical engagement, to express their needs and understand risks?How do we ensure optimised links between the different tiers of the health and care system to guarantee the systematic and systemic implementation of effective people-centred strategies?Which types of measures can best increase health literacy and digital literacy by targeting people and/or health and care professionals?How should preventive and curative services be designed for those with lower health literacy and fewer possibilities for self-management?How should the potential of health promotion and disease prevention be unlocked by means of concrete strategies, involving multiple actors and sectors?What measures are effective to support informal carers?What are the skills and contextual conditions needed to deliver personalised medicine, and how will personalised medicine affect health and care in the future?Consistent with the shift towards more people- and population-centred health and care, a holistic and outcome-based approach that focuses on rigorous measures to assess and improve the quality of health and care is becoming increasingly important.SRIA OverviewExploreSearchCo-funded by the European unionFunded by the European Union under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme - Grant Agreement N: 101095654.
