The European Health Data Space (EHDS)


What is the European Health Data Space (EHDS)?
The European Health Data Space is a health specific ecosystem comprised of rules, common standards and practices, infrastructures and a governance framework that aims at:
1. Empowering individuals through increased digital access to and control of their electronic personal health data, at national level and EU-wide.
2. Fostering a single market for electronic health record systems, relevant medical devices and high risk AI systems.
3. Providing a trustworthy and efficient set-up for the use of health data for research, innovation, policy-making and regulatory activities (secondary use of data).	 
 The European Health Data Space is a key pillar of the European Health Union. It builds further on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the NIS 2 Directive.
 The European Union is building a strong European Health Union, in which all EU countries prepare and respond to health crises, have available, affordable, innovative and adequate medical supplies, and member countries work together to improve prevention, treatment and aftercare for diseases. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic shows the importance of coordination among European countries to protect health, both during a crisis and in normal times. The European Health Union improves EU-level protection, prevention, preparedness and response against human health hazards.	    

24 April 2024 - The Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) approved the creation of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) 
MEPs voted with 445 in favour and 142 against (39 abstentions) to approve the inter-institutional agreement on establishing a European Health Data Space. It will empower patients to access their health data in an electronic format, including from a different member state to the one in which they live, and allow health professionals to consult their patients files with their consent (so-called primary use), also from other EU countries. These electronic health records (EHR) would include patient summaries, electronic prescriptions, medical imagery and laboratory results.
The law will make it possible to transfer health data safely to health professionals in other EU countries (based on MyHealth@EU infrastructure), for example when citizens move to another state. It will be possible to download the health record free of charge.
Additionally, the Health Data Space would unleash the research potential of health data in an anonymised or pseudonymised format. Data including health records, clinical trials, pathogens, health claims and reimbursements, genetic data, public health registry information, wellness data and information on healthcare resources, expenditure and financing, could be processed for public interest purposes, including research, statistics and policy-making (so-called secondary use). Data could, for example, be used to find treatments for rare diseases, where small datasets and fragmentation currently prevent advances in treatments.
Secondary use will not be allowed for commercial purposes including advertising, assessing insurance requests or lending conditions or making job market decisions. Access decisions will be made by national data access bodies.	  
 Next steps 
The provisional agreement still needs to be formally approved by the Council. Once published in the EUs Official Journal, it will enter into force twenty days later. It will be applied two years after, with certain exceptions, including primary and secondary use of data categories, which will apply four to six years later, depending on the category.

15 March 2024 - political agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council of the EU on the European Health Data Space (EHDS), one of the central building blocks of a strong European Health Union.
Next step: The European Parliament and the Council will formally adopt the new Regulation. 



The agreement reached by the co-legislators establishes clear rules for the use of health data for better healthcare delivery, research, innovation, and policymaking. 
The new rules will harness the potential offered by the safe and secure exchange, use, and re-use of health data, while ensuring full compliance with the EU's high data protection standards.
Under the new rules, citizens will have immediate and easy access to their digital health data wherever they are in the EU. Health professionals will be able to access the medical records of a patient when required for treatment in a different Member State, allowing for evidence-based decision making, in full compliance with EU data protection rules. 
The EHDS also creates a strong legal framework for the re-use of health data for research, innovation, and public health purposes. The data will help develop life-saving treatments and personalised medicines, but also improve crisis preparedness, under strict data security and access conditions, and respecting fundamental rights.

6 December 2023 - Agreement on the Councils proposal for the European Health Data Space (EHDS)
After this agreement, the EU Council presidency begins negotiations with the European Parliament, with a view to reaching a provisional agreement on the proposed regulation. 
The Councils mandate provides clarity on issues such as the scope of the regulation, alignment with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the criteria for providing access to electronic health data.
The Council proposes the creation of two steering groups, made up of member-state representatives, to manage MyHealth@EU and HealthData@EU; other stakeholders may be invited as observers to discuss relevant issues.
The Councils mandate expands the role of EU member states in the proposed EHDS governing board, and requires national digital health authorities to publish an activity report every two years.
Under the Councils mandate, member states will have the discretion to allow patients to opt out of the new data-sharing system.	  

3 May 2022 - The European Commission launched the European Health Data Space (EHDS)
	1. Thanks to the EHDS, people will have immediate, and easy access to the data in electronic form, free of charge. They can easily share these data with other health professionals in
and across Member States to improve health care delivery. Citizens will be in full control
of their data and will be able to add information, rectify wrong data, restrict access to others
and obtain information on how their data are used and for which purpose.
2. Member States will ensure that patient summaries, ePrescriptions, images and image reports, laboratory results, discharge reports are issued and accepted in a common European
format.
3. Interoperability and security will become mandatory requirements. Manufacturers of electronic health record systems will need to certify compliance with these standards.
4. To ensure that citizens' rights are safeguarded, all Member States have to appoint digital health authorities. These authorities will participate in the cross-border digital infrastructure (MyHealth@EU) that will support patients to share their data across borders.
5. The EHDS creates a strong legal framework for the use of health data for research, innovation, public health, policy-making and regulatory purposes. Under strict conditions,
researchers, innovators, public institutions or industry will have access to large amounts of
high-quality health data, crucial to develop life-saving treatments, vaccines or medical devices
and ensuring better access to healthcare and more resilient health systems.
6. The access to such data by researchers, companies or institutions will require a permit from a
health data access body, to be set up in all Member States. Access will only be granted if the
requested data is used for specific purposes, in closed, secure environments and without
revealing the identity of the individual. It is also strictly prohibited to use the data for
decisions, which are detrimental to citizens such as designing harmful products or services or
increasing an insurance premium.
7. The health data access bodies will be connected to the new decentralised EU-infrastructure
for secondary use (HealthData@EU) which will be set up to support cross-border projects.	

Understanding the European Health Data Space (EHDS)
Digitalisation is essential for the future of healthcare. The digital transformation is crucial to
provide better healthcare to citizens, to build stronger and more resilient health systems, to
support long-term competitiveness and innovation in the EUs medical industry, and to help
the EU recover from the pandemic.
Data is an indispensable part of todays world. When used responsibly and in full respect of
fundamental rights, it can bring incredible benefits to every aspect of our everyday lives,
including our health. Member States health systems already generate, process and store a
vast amount of data. Yet it often remains difficult for citizens to access their health data
electronically and for researchers to use it to improve diagnosis and treatments.
A vast amount of health data is generated every second, providing healthcare services
and researchers with potential valuable insights. Health data reuse is estimated to be worth
around EUR 25-30 billion annually. That figure is expected to reach around EUR 50 billion
within 10 years. 
However, the complexity and divergence of rules, structures and processes
within and across Member States makes it difficult to easily access and share health data.
This creates barriers to healthcare delivery and innovation, leaving patients unable to benefit
from its potential. 
Moreover, health systems are becoming the target of cyberattacks.
Therefore, the healthcare sector and relevant cyber security authorities need to consider
cybersecurity as a key factor for ensuring the resilience and availability of key healthcare
services.
In essence, the EU health sector is rich in data, but poor in making it work for people and
science. The EU needs to tap into this huge potential to turn the wealth of health data across
Europe into knowledge at the service of citizens, and to better prevent, diagnose and treat
diseases. 
Health data can help achieve more efficient, higher-quality, safer and more
personalised care, and help improve healthcare delivery. Health data3
and data science could
dramatically transform public health and revolutionise healthcare systems, enabling lifesaving healthcare improvements. Health data can also play a crucial role in speeding up the
development of new medical products and treatments for patients who need them most. 	
The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated the importance of digital services in the health domain. It has shown that up-to-date, reliable and FAIR health data is key in
providing an efficient public health response to crisis and in developing effective 
treatments and vaccines. It has also significantly accelerated the uptake of digital tools,
such as electronic health records (personal medical records or similar documents in digital
form), e-prescriptions and digital health applications, as well as the sharing of research data.
Digital health products and services, including telehealth, are no longer novelties. They are
becoming a part of everyday care delivery.
Harnessing the power of health data through the digital transformation is especially relevant
when patients move within or to other EU countries; and when researchers, innovators,
policy-makers or regulators need critical data that can enable the power of science to help
patients. Similarly, sharing health data in border regions where individuals access healthcare
services across the border much more frequently will be far easier.

Current challenges in using health data.
People cannot always easily access their health data electronically, and if they want to
consult doctors in more than one hospital or medical centre, they often cannot share the data
with other health professionals. Today, a patients health data is often still recorded on
paper, untraceable and scattered across various places (hospitals, general practitioners
venues, medical centres, etc.).
The situation becomes even more difficult when crossing national borders. If a patient visits a
doctor in another country, their medical information (including diagnostic images) is often
not accessible, which can lead to delays and errors in diagnosis or treatment. In most cases,
doctors cannot see the patients health data if they have undergone health interventions in
another country. Continuity of care and rapid access to personal electronic health data is
even more important for residents in border regions, crossing the border frequently to
receive healthcare.
The open public consultation23 for the European Health Data Space proposal showed that
88% of respondents think it should promote citizens control over their own health data,
including access to health data and transmission of their health data in electronic format.
84% of respondents say that citizens should have the right to transmit ones health data in
electronic format to another professional or entity of their choice and 82% feel that they
should have the right to request public healthcare providers to share their health data
electronically with other healthcare providers/entities of their choice. 83% of respondents
say that the European Health Data Space should facilitate delivery of healthcare for citizens
across borders.
Researchers and industry, along with policy-makers and innovators, face important obstacles
in accessing the data they need to develop new products, to take informed decisions or to
monitor the side effects of medicinal products over the long term, based on real-world
evidence, with impact on patient safety. In many cases, consent is the only way to access
data for research, policy-making and regulatory purposes. It is very costly and cumbersome
for researchers to get consent from every patient to use the patients data in their research.
	Even when the patient consents, data holders are sometimes reluctant to provide data for
reasons other than data protection and prefer to keep the health data for their activities. The
current regulatory fragmentation between Member States hampers research and innovation
by small players, as well as cross-border research.	  

Primary use of health data.
1. Patients will have their electronic health data available via access points established by
Member States. A cross-border digital infrastructure for primary use will connect
Member States and allow patients to share their health data.
2. Patients will be empowered to control and share their electronic health data with a
healthcare provider of their choice.
3. Member States will be required to make priority categories of data available in a
common European electronic health record exchange format, such as patient
summaries, e-prescriptions, e-dispensations, medical images and image reports,
laboratory results and discharge reports.
4. Where personal health data has not been collected electronically prior to the application
of this Regulation, Member States may decide not to convert it into an electronic format.
5. Health professionals will be able to access electronic health records and should update
the electronic health data of the patients they treat.
6. To support data being shared between healthcare providers, mandatory requirements
for interoperability, security, safety and privacy will be introduced, as well as mandatory
self-certification of electronic health records covering interoperability and security.
7. All Member States will be required to participate in cross-border digital
infrastructure for the exchange of health data for healthcare delivery
(MyHealth@EU).
8. A pilot project will support patients having access to their data on a mobile device in the
language of the country of destination.
9. To facilitate the implementation, transitional periods will apply for certain obligations
including the registration of health data, access of health professionals to data, making
data available in the European format, the participation in the cross border digital
infrastructure, self-certification of electronic health record systems, as well as the
voluntary label for wellness applications.
10. Member States will have to set up a digital health authority to ensure that the additional
rights for individuals are properly implemented.

Secondary use of health data.
1. The European Health Data Space sets out a common EU framework allowing for use of
health data for research, innovation, public health, policy-making, regulatory activities
and personalised medicine. It will draw on the creation of a new and decentralised EUinfrastructure for secondary use of health data (HealthData@EU) that will connect
health data access bodies which should be set up in all Member States.
2. Those who wish to re-use health data will need to apply for a permit from a health data
access body. The data permit sets out how the data may be used and for what purpose.
3. The data can only be accessed and processed in closed secure environments to be
provided by the health data access bodies with clear standards for cyber security.
4. Only anonymous data can be extracted by the user who applied for the permit from the
secure processing environment. Where researchers, companies or public institutions need
access to personal electronic health data they can only access it in pseudonymised form,
i.e. data offering information about the disease, symptoms and medication, without
		  revealing to the user the identity of the individual. It is forbidden for the user to attempt to
re-identify the data subjects.
5. It will be forbidden to use the data to take decisions detrimental to individuals, to
increase insurance premiums, to market health products towards health professionals or
patients or to design harmful products or services.
6. Health data access bodies will have to ensure transparency: information will be
published about data access applications. In addition, data users must make public the
results of their electronic health data uses and inform the health data access bodies of
any significant findings relevant for the health of individuals.
7. For simple cases, users can directly request data from a single health data provider as long
as the same safeguards for privacy and security are ensured.
8. Researchers and innovators from third countries can access data for secondary use under
the same conditions and requirements as those from inside the EU.
9. All Member States will be required to participate in the EU-infrastructure for secondary
use (HealthData@EU) to facilitate cross-border studies. This infrastructure will be piloted
in a EU4Health project starting in 2022.
EU governance mechanism.
1. A new European Health Data Space Board chaired by the Commission will be created,
composed of the representatives of digital health authorities and health data access bodies
from all the Member States, and observers, depending on area of work.
2. It will contribute to the consistent application of the Regulation throughout the EU, to
coordinate and exchange best practices and will cooperate with other bodies at EU level.
3. Member States will cooperate at EU level to ensure the smooth functioning of the two
cross-border digital infrastructures (primary and secondary). 		

The European Health Data Space, together with the GDPR, will give people the right to:	
1. Access their health data in electronic form immediately, free of charge and in an easily
readable, accessible and commonly used format. Data can be accessed using patient
portals, on computers or smart phones, depending on how the Member States make available
this information at national level. For people with disabilities to be able to enjoy their rights,
the access must be accessible in line with the requirements of the European Accessibility Act
(Directive 2019/882);
2. Share their data in electronic form with other health professionals when going to another
hospital, without hindrance from previous healthcare providers or manufacturers;
3. Add data to their electronic health record for themselves or for people who trust them, such
as their children;
4. Request changes to erroneous data online;
5. Restrict access to their electronic health data or part of the data; in cases of vital interest,
where their life is at stake, such data may however be made available with additional
restrictions;
6. Easily obtain information on which professional(s) accessed their data.
Member States are required to designate digital health authorities that will have a
fundamental role in enforcing the above-mentioned rights.

Examples of how the EHDS will function	
Example 1: A woman living in Portugal is going on holidays to France. Unfortunately, she gets sick in France and therefore needs to see a local general practitioner. Thanks to the EHDS and MyHealth@EU, a doctor in France will see on his/her computer the medical history of this patient in French. The doctor can prescribe the necessary medicine based on the medical history of the patient, avoiding for instance products to which the patient is allergic.
Example 2: A health tech company is developing a new AI-based medical decision support tool that assists doctors to make diagnostic and treatment decisions following a review of the patient's laboratory images. The AI compares the patient's images with those of many other previous patients. Through the EHDS, the company is able to have efficient and secure access to a large number of medical images to train the AI algorithm and optimise its accuracy and effectiveness before seeking market approval.
Example 3: A man has a medical image of his lungs, taken in the public hospital where he was brought in by the emergency team. Shortly after, he visits his regular pulmonologist in another hospital. Thanks to the EHDS, his pulmonologist can see the medical image performed in the other hospital, thus avoiding a new, unnecessary test.

3. Member States will be required to make priority categories of data available in a
common European electronic health record exchange format, such as patient
summaries, e-prescriptions, e-dispensations, medical images and image reports,
laboratory results and discharge reports.
4. Where personal health data has not been collected electronically prior to the application
of this Regulation, Member States may decide not to convert it into an electronic format.
5. Health professionals will be able to access electronic health records and should update
the electronic health data of the patients they treat.
6. To support data being shared between healthcare providers, mandatory requirements
for interoperability, security, safety and privacy will be introduced, as well as mandatory
self-certification of electronic health records covering interoperability and security.
7. All Member States will be required to participate in cross-border digital
infrastructure for the exchange of health data for healthcare delivery
(MyHealth@EU).
8. A pilot project will support patients having access to their data on a mobile device in the
language of the country of destination.
9. To facilitate the implementation, transitional periods will apply for certain obligations
including the registration of health data, access of health professionals to data, making
data available in the European format, the participation in the cross border digital
infrastructure, self-certification of electronic health record systems, as well as the
voluntary label for wellness applications.
10. Member States will have to set up a digital health authority to ensure that the additional
rights for individuals are properly implemented.

Secondary use of health data.
1. The European Health Data Space sets out a common EU framework allowing for use of
health data for research, innovation, public health, policy-making, regulatory activities
and personalised medicine. It will draw on the creation of a new and decentralised EUinfrastructure for secondary use of health data (HealthData@EU) that will connect
health data access bodies which should be set up in all Member States.
2. Those who wish to re-use health data will need to apply for a permit from a health data
access body. The data permit sets out how the data may be used and for what purpose.
3. The data can only be accessed and processed in closed secure environments to be
provided by the health data access bodies with clear standards for cyber security.
4. Only anonymous data can be extracted by the user who applied for the permit from the
secure processing environment. Where researchers, companies or public institutions need
access to personal electronic health data they can only access it in pseudonymised form,
i.e. data offering information about the disease, symptoms and medication, without
		  revealing to the user the identity of the individual. It is forbidden for the user to attempt to
re-identify the data subjects.
5. It will be forbidden to use the data to take decisions detrimental to individuals, to
increase insurance premiums, to market health products towards health professionals or
patients or to design harmful products or services.
6. Health data access bodies will have to ensure transparency: information will be
published about data access applications. In addition, data users must make public the
results of their electronic health data uses and inform the health data access bodies of
any significant findings relevant for the health of individuals.
7. For simple cases, users can directly request data from a single health data provider as long
as the same safeguards for privacy and security are ensured.
8. Researchers and innovators from third countries can access data for secondary use under
the same conditions and requirements as those from inside the EU.
9. All Member States will be required to participate in the EU-infrastructure for secondary
use (HealthData@EU) to facilitate cross-border studies. This infrastructure will be piloted
in a EU4Health project starting in 2022.
EU governance mechanism.
1. A new European Health Data Space Board chaired by the Commission will be created,
composed of the representatives of digital health authorities and health data access bodies
from all the Member States, and observers, depending on area of work.
2. It will contribute to the consistent application of the Regulation throughout the EU, to
coordinate and exchange best practices and will cooperate with other bodies at EU level.
3. Member States will cooperate at EU level to ensure the smooth functioning of the two
cross-border digital infrastructures (primary and secondary). 		

The European Health Data Space, together with the GDPR, will give people the right to:	
1. Access their health data in electronic form immediately, free of charge and in an easily
readable, accessible and commonly used format. Data can be accessed using patient
portals, on computers or smart phones, depending on how the Member States make available
this information at national level. For people with disabilities to be able to enjoy their rights,
the access must be accessible in line with the requirements of the European Accessibility Act
(Directive 2019/882);
2. Share their data in electronic form with other health professionals when going to another
hospital, without hindrance from previous healthcare providers or manufacturers;
3. Add data to their electronic health record for themselves or for people who trust them, such
as their children;
4. Request changes to erroneous data online;
5. Restrict access to their electronic health data or part of the data; in cases of vital interest,
where their life is at stake, such data may however be made available with additional
restrictions;
6. Easily obtain information on which professional(s) accessed their data.
Member States are required to designate digital health authorities that will have a
fundamental role in enforcing the above-mentioned rights.

Examples of how the EHDS will function	
Example 1: A woman living in Portugal is going on holidays to France. Unfortunately, she gets sick in France and therefore needs to see a local general practitioner. Thanks to the EHDS and MyHealth@EU, a doctor in France will see on his/her computer the medical history of this patient in French. The doctor can prescribe the necessary medicine based on the medical history of the patient, avoiding for instance products to which the patient is allergic.
Example 2: A health tech company is developing a new AI-based medical decision support tool that assists doctors to make diagnostic and treatment decisions following a review of the patient's laboratory images. The AI compares the patient's images with those of many other previous patients. Through the EHDS, the company is able to have efficient and secure access to a large number of medical images to train the AI algorithm and optimise its accuracy and effectiveness before seeking market approval.
Example 3: A man has a medical image of his lungs, taken in the public hospital where he was brought in by the emergency team. Shortly after, he visits his regular pulmonologist in another hospital. Thanks to the EHDS, his pulmonologist can see the medical image performed in the other hospital, thus avoiding a new, unnecessary test.

Overview

		
		In 2020, hospitals, healthcare providers and medical facilities were struggling to handle not only the influx of patients suffering from Covid-19, but also a surge of ransomware attacks, as criminals (including state-sponsored groups) exploited the crisis to hit the sector.
Month after month, there are many successful cyberattacks on the healthcare industry. Cybersecurity breaches that expose sensitive data from thousands of people are especially important, as the privacy rules have become a nightmare for healthcare providers.
Social engineering, malware attacks, computer theft, unauthorized access to sensitive information (medical history, treatment of patients etc.) and ransomware, are only some of the challenges. WannaCry ransomware, for example, crippled parts of the U.K.s National Health Service for many days.
After a successful attack, the damage to brand reputation of the healthcare provider is very important.
Healthcare providers must have sufficient defense mechanisms in place, and must be able to provide evidence about that. Cybersecurity awareness and training for healthcare practitioners, doctors and personnel is an important step, as even the best systems cannot protect the industry, when the persons having authorized access do not understand the risks and the modus operandi of the attackers.
Cybersecurity was not historically a major component of healthcare management. Month after month the industry is evolving into an increasingly digital environment, and in todays threat landscape, healthcare organizations have cybersecurity professionals on staff, establish security policies and procedures, follow corporate governance best practices, ensure C-suite support and board involvement in understanding risks and countermeasures, and train all persons that have access to sensitive data.
A very significant priority is to ensure that each user who has access to sensitive data is well-trained and able to use data efficiently for the appropriate purpose. Cybersecurity leads to inconvenience by design. Only when users understand the risks and the need for countermeasures, they do not cut corners and they follow the policies and the procedures.
We always tailor our training programs to meet specific requirements. You may contact us to discuss your needs.

Target Audience
The program is beneficial to all persons working for the healthcare industry (medical care, administration, research, sales, and consulting). It has been designed for doctors, nurses, assistants, therapists, laboratory technicians, and all persons having authorized access to systems and data.

 Duration

One hour to one day, depending on the needs, the content of the program and the case studies. We always tailor the program to the needs of each client.

Board Training in the Healthcare Industry


Overview

				   
				   The Board and the CEO of legal entities in the healthcare industry must have the knowledge and skills necessary to assess cybersecurity risks, challenge security plans, discuss activities, formulate opinions, and evaluate policies and solutions that protect the assets of their organization. The failure to maintain adequate risk oversight can expose companies, officers, and directors to liability. 

						Directors owe fiduciary duties to their shareholders and have a significant role in overseeing the risk management of their entities. The failure to exercise appropriate oversight constitutes a breach of the duty of loyalty. A decision about cybersecurity that is negligent constitutes a breach of the duty of care. 

							 The Board and the CEO must also assess whether and how to disclose a cyberattack internally and externally to customers and stakeholders. After a successful cyberattack, healthcare providers must provide evidence that they have an adequate and tested cybersecurity program in place that meets international standards, and that they had the knowledge, policies and procedures to prevent and detect a security breach.
We provide short, comprehensive briefings on key issues the board needs to be informed about in order to exercise professional judgment and adequate risk oversight.

Our Briefings for the Board:
We offer custom briefings for the Board of Directors and executive management, tailored to the specific needs of each legal entity. Our briefings can be short and comprehensive (60 minutes), or longer, depending on the needs, the content of the program and the case studies.

  A2. Understanding the European Health Data Space (EHDS), for the Board of Directors and executive management of EU and non-EU legal entities.
 Overview. 
The European Health Data Space is a health specific ecosystem comprised of rules, common standards and practices, infrastructures and a governance framework that aims at:
1. Empowering individuals through increased digital access to and control of their electronic personal health data, at national level and EU-wide.
2. Fostering a single market for electronic health record systems, relevant medical devices and high risk AI systems.
3. Providing a trustworthy and efficient set-up for the use of health data for research, innovation, policy-making and regulatory activities (secondary use of data).	 
 The European Health Data Space is a key pillar of the European Health Union. It builds further on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the NIS 2 Directive.
 The European Union is building a strong European Health Union, in which all EU countries prepare and respond to health crises, have available, affordable, innovative and adequate medical supplies, and member countries work together to improve prevention, treatment and aftercare for diseases. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic shows the importance of coordination among European countries to protect health, both during a crisis and in normal times. The European Health Union improves EU-level protection, prevention, preparedness and response against human health hazards.	    

 Understanding the European Health Data Space (EHDS). 
	1. Thanks to the EHDS, people will have immediate, and easy access to the data in electronic form, free of charge. They can easily share these data with other health professionals in
and across Member States to improve health care delivery. Citizens will be in full control
of their data and will be able to add information, rectify wrong data, restrict access to others
and obtain information on how their data are used and for which purpose.
2. Member States will ensure that patient summaries, ePrescriptions, images and image reports, laboratory results, discharge reports are issued and accepted in a common European
format.
3. Interoperability and security will become mandatory requirements. Manufacturers of electronic health record systems will need to certify compliance with these standards.
4. To ensure that citizens' rights are safeguarded, all Member States have to appoint digital health authorities. These authorities will participate in the cross-border digital infrastructure (MyHealth@EU) that will support patients to share their data across borders.
5. The EHDS creates a strong legal framework for the use of health data for research, innovation, public health, policy-making and regulatory purposes. Under strict conditions,
researchers, innovators, public institutions or industry will have access to large amounts of
high-quality health data, crucial to develop life-saving treatments, vaccines or medical devices
and ensuring better access to healthcare and more resilient health systems.
6. The access to such data by researchers, companies or institutions will require a permit from a
health data access body, to be set up in all Member States. Access will only be granted if the
requested data is used for specific purposes, in closed, secure environments and without
revealing the identity of the individual. It is also strictly prohibited to use the data for
decisions, which are detrimental to citizens such as designing harmful products or services or
increasing an insurance premium.
7. The health data access bodies will be connected to the new decentralised EU-infrastructure
for secondary use (HealthData@EU) which will be set up to support cross-border projects.

A3. The NIS 2 Directive as it applies in the healthcare industry, for the Board of Directors and executive management of EU legal entities.
Overview
The NIS 2 Directive replaces and repeals the NIS Directive (Directive 2016/1148/EC). NIS 2 will improve cybersecurity risk management and will introduce reporting obligations across sectors such as energy, transport, health and digital infrastructure.
Important obligations: According to Article 20 (Governance), the management bodies of essential and important entities must approve the cybersecurity risk-management measures taken by those entities, oversee its implementation and "can be held liable for infringements."
 According to Article 20, Member States shall ensure that the "members of the management bodies of essential and important entities are required to follow training," and shall encourage essential and important entities to offer similar training to their employees on a regular basis, in order that they gain sufficient knowledge and skills to enable them to identify risks and assess cybersecurity risk-management practices and their impact on the services provided by the entity.
 According to Article 21 (Cybersecurity risk-management measures), essential and important entities must take appropriate and proportionate technical, operational and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of network and information systems which those entities use for their operations or for the provision of their services, and to prevent or minimise the impact of incidents on recipients of their services and on other services.
 Taking into account the "state-of-the-art" and, where applicable, relevant European and international standards, as well as the cost of implementation, the measures referred shall ensure a level of security of network and information systems appropriate to the risks posed. When assessing the proportionality of those measures, due account shall be taken of the degree of the entitys exposure to risks, the entitys size and the likelihood of occurrence of incidents and their severity, including their societal and economic impact.
 The measures shall be based on an "all-hazards approach" that aims to protect network and information systems and the physical environment of those systems from incidents, and shall include "at least" the following:
 (a) policies on risk analysis and information system security;
 (b) incident handling;
 (c) business continuity, such as backup management and disaster recovery, and crisis management;
 (d) supply chain security, including security-related aspects concerning the relationships between each entity and its direct suppliers or service providers;
 (e) security in network and information systems acquisition, development and maintenance, including vulnerability handling and disclosure;
 (f) policies and procedures to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk-management measures;
 (g) basic cyber hygiene practices and cybersecurity training;
 (h) policies and procedures regarding the use of cryptography and, where appropriate, encryption;
 (i) human resources security, access control policies and asset management;
 (j) the use of multi-factor authentication or continuous authentication solutions, secured voice, video and text communications and secured emergency communication systems within the entity, where appropriate.

A5. Understanding the extraterritorial application of EU law and the equivalence decisions of the European Commission.
  Course Synopsis 
 	The terms extraterritoriality and extraterritorial jurisdiction refer to the competence of a country to extend its legal powers beyond its territorial boundaries, and to make, apply and enforce rules of conduct in respect of persons, property or events beyond its territory. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, for example, applies to foreign auditors and foreign companies whose securities are listed in a US stock exchange.
 Extraterritorial application of EU law is the application of EU provisions outside the territory of the EU, resulting from EU unilateral legislative and regulatory action. 
 For example, according to EUs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), non-EU data controllers and processors in any country, must comply with the GDPR obligations, if they offer goods or services to individuals in the EU. 
 Anu Bradford, Professor of Law in Columbia Law School, is the author of the book The Brussels Effect: How the European Union Rules the World (2020), that was named one of the best books of 2020 by Foreign Affairs.
 In 2012, she introduced the concept of the Brussels Effect, that describes Europes unilateral power to regulate global markets. 
 Anu Bradford explains why most global corporations choose to adopt the European laws, regulations and standards in the design and operation of their products and services.
 The EU standards are generally stricter, and in most cases, when you comply with EU rules, you comply with laws and regulations around the world.
 Even when this approach is more costly, global corporations prefer to have an enterprise-wide, single mode of production and operations, and to market their goods and services globally.
 Following the doctrine "you comply with EU rules, you comply around the world", global corporations and service providers need professionals that understand the EU laws, regulations, standards and guidelines.	
 When the European Commission determines that the regulatory or supervisory regime of a non-EU country is equivalent to the corresponding EU framework:
  - allows authorities in the EU to rely on supervised entities' compliance with equivalent rules in a non-EU country,
  - reduces or eliminates overlaps in compliance requirements for both EU and non-EU entities,
  - makes services and products of non-EU companies accepted in the EU,
  - allows third-country firms to provide services without establishment in the EU single-market.
  We will discuss what happens when the European Commission determines that the regulatory or supervisory regime of a non-EU country is not equivalent to the corresponding EU framework, or when the European Commission has not yet determined if the regulatory or supervisory regime of a non-EU country is equivalent.
  We can understand better equivalence decisions from the experience we have with the Accounting Directive, the Audit Directive, the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the Credit Rating Agencies Regulation, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR), the Prospectus Directive, the Solvency II Directive and the Transparency Directive.
 After this presentation, the Board and executive management will have a clear understanding or what is mandatory and what is "nice to have", and the consequences of non-compliance.

B1. An effective cybersecurity culture and the Board of Directors.
 Overview
The Board of Directors, as the culture owner, must ensure that the beliefs, the perceptions, the attitudes, the assumptions, and the norms regarding cybersecurity are in line with the mission and the vision of their organization. They must also ensure that information security considerations are an integral part of every employees and managers job, habits, and conduct.

The majority of data breaches within organisations are the result of human actors. Cybersecurity is not only a technical challenge. As long as managers and employees can provide access to systems and data, cybersecurity depends on them too. 

Employees that have access to critical assets of an organization, become targets. Those that have access to technology and organizational assets are also responsible for the protection of those assets. Are they fit and proper to handle this responsibility? Do they have the awareness and skills necessary to protect themselves and their organisation?
 
  The economic costs of cyberattacks and breaches are more important than many directors and managers believe. There are direct and indirect costs, that include downtime of services, compromise of confidential information, fines, decreased profits through reputational damage, supervisory scrutiny etc. 
  We must tailor the program, to include the organizations cybersecurity compliance obligations and their implications across all relevant jurisdictions, the specific threat actors the organization faces, and how is the organization more likely to be breached. 

Target Audience

B2. Social engineering and the Board of Directors
Overview
Cybersecurity is not only a technical challenge. It is also a behavioral challenge. As long as managers and employees can provide access to systems and data, cybersecurity depends on them too.
Employees that have access to critical assets of an organization, become targets. Those that have access to technology and organizational assets are also responsible for the protection of those assets. Are they fit and proper to handle this responsibility? Do they have the awareness and skills necessary to protect themselves and their organisation?
The Board and the CEO are high value targets, so they are high risk targets too. For them, standard security awareness programs are not going to suffice. The way they are being targeted is anything but standard. They are the recipients of the most sophisticated, tailored attacks, including state-sponsored attacks. These are attacks that are often well planned, well crafted, and employ advanced psychological techniques able to sway a target towards a desired (compromising) behavior without raising any alarms.
Are the Board members and the CEO equipped with the knowledge necessary to defend the organization and to protect themselves from well-funded, planned, and sophisticated attacks?

B3. Social engineering: the targeting and victimization of key people through weaponized psychology
 Overview
Threat actors are not interested in attacking everyone and anyone in an organization. High value individuals are the ones with elevated access to information, assets, and systems. Board members and the C-Suite become by default high-risk targets for cyberattacks. 
The most effective and frequent method to attack high value individuals is weaponized psychology. Board members and C-Level executives must learn the answers to the following questions: 
 - Which is the advanced psychological game that threat actors use to compromise their targets? 
 - How do they find their targets vulnerabilities? 
 - What can we do to avoid being exploited from a determined adversary with a carefully planned attack? 
High-value individuals must understand the threat, to protect themselves and their organisation from cyber attacks, industrial espionage, competitors, and other threat actors lurking online and offline.

B4. State-sponsored but independent hacking groups. The long arm of countries that exploit legal pluralism and make the law a strategic instrument


 Overview
According to Article 51 of the U.N. Charter: Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the
inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member
of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain
	 international peace and security.
But is a cyber-attack comparable to an armed attack?

There is no international consensus on a precise definition of a use of force, in or out of
			   cyberspace. Nations assert different definitions and apply different thresholds for what constitutes a use of force.

For example, if cyber operations cause effects that, if caused by traditional physical means, would
be regarded as a use of force under jus ad bellum, then such cyber operations would likely also be
			   regarded as a use of force.

Important weaknesses of international law include the assumption that it is possible to isolate
military and civilian targets with sufficient clarity, and to distinguish a tangible military objective
			   to be attained from an attack.

More than 20 countries have announced their intent to use offensive cyber capabilities, in line
			   with Article 2(4) and Article 51 of the United Nations (UN) Charter.

Unfortunately, these capabilities will not help when the attackers are State-sponsored groups, and
the States supporting them, claim that not only they are not involved, but also that their
adversaries (the victims) have fabricated evidence about it. This is a very effective disinformation
			   operation.

Adversaries have already successfully exploited weakness of non-authoritarian societies, especially the political and legal interpretation of facts from different political parties. It is difficult to use offensive cyber capabilities in line with democratic principles and international law, as it is almost impossible to distinguish with absolute certainty between attacks from States and attacks from State-sponsored independent groups.

Even when intelligence services know that an attack comes from a State that uses a State-sponsored independent group, they cannot disclose the information and the evidence that
supports their assessment, as disclosures about technical and physical intelligence capabilities and
initiatives can undermine current and future operations. This is the second attribution problem
			    they know but they cannot disclose what they know.

As an example, we will discuss the data breach at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management
(OPM). OPM systems had information related to the background investigations of current,
former, and prospective federal government employees, U.S. military personnel, and those for
whom a federal background investigation was conducted. The attackers now have access to
information about federal employees, federal retirees, and former federal employees. They have
access to military records, veterans' status information, addresses, dates of birth, job and pay
history, health insurance and life insurance information, pension information, data on age,
			   gender, race, even fingerprints.
But why?
Aldrich Ames, a former intelligence officer turned mole, has said: Espionage, for the most part,
involves finding a person who knows something or has something that you can induce them
	 secretly to give to you. That almost always involves a betrayal of trust.

Finding this person is much easier, if you have data easily converted to intelligence, like the data
stolen from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). This leak is a direct risk for the
			   critical infrastructure.

There are questions to be answered, and decisions to be made, not only about tactic and strategy,
			   but also political and legal interpretation.

B5. Deception, disinformation, misinformation, propaganda, and the role of the Board.

 Overview
Misinformation is incorrect or misleading information.
Disinformation is false information, deliberately and often covertly spread, in order to influence
public opinion, or obscure the truth.
Propaganda is a broader and older term. Propaganda uses disinformation as a method. While the
French philosopher Jacques Driencourt asserted that everything is propaganda, the term is most
often associated with political persuasion and psychological warfare.
Psychological warfare is the use of propaganda against an enemy (or even a friend that could
become an enemy in the future), with the intent to break his will to fight or resist, or to render him
favorably disposed to one's position.
In deception (according to Bell and Whaley), someone is showing the false and hiding the real.
Hiding the real is divided into masking, repackaging, and dazzling, while showing the fake is
divided into mimicking, inventing, and decoying.
People are remarkably bad at detecting deception and disinformation. 

They often trust what others say, and usually they are right to do so. This is called the truth bias.
People also tend to believe something when it is repeated. They tend to believe something they
learn for the first time, and subsequent rebuttals may reinforce the original information, rather
than dissipate it.
Humans have an unconscious preference for things they associate with themselves, and they are
more likely to believe messages from users they perceive as similar to themselves. They believe
that sources are credible if other people consider them credible. They trust fake user profiles with
images and background information they like.
Citizens must understand that millions of fake accounts follow thousands of real and fake users,
creating the perception of a large following. This large following enhances perceived credibility,
and attracts more human followers, creating a positive feedback cycle.
People are more likely to believe others who are in positions of power. Fake accounts have false
credentials, like false affiliation with government agencies, corporations, activists, and political
parties, to boost credibility.
Freedom of information and expression are of paramount importance in many cultures. The more
freedom of information we have, the better. But the more information we have, the more difficult
becomes to understand what is right and what is wrong. The right of expression and the freedom
of information can be used against the citizens. We often have the weaponization of information.
The Internet and the social media are key game-changers in exploiting rights and freedoms. In the
past, a secret service should work hard to get disinformation in the press. Today, the Internet and
the social media give the opportunity for spreading limitless fake photos, reports, and "opinions".
Many secret services wage online wars using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Instagram,
Pinterest, Viber etc. Only imagination is the limit.
Social media platforms, autonomous agents, and big data are directed towards the manipulation
of public opinion. Social media bots (computer programs mimicking human behaviour and
conversations, using artificial intelligence) allow for massive amplification of political views,
manufacture trends, game hashtags, add content, spam opposition, attack journalists and persons
that tell the truth.
In the hands of State-sponsored groups these automated tools can be used to both boost and
silence communication and organization among citizens.
Over 10 percent of content across social media websites, and 62 percent of all web traffic, is
generated by bots, not humans. Over 45 million Twitter accounts are bots, according to
researchers at the University of Southern California.
Machine-driven communications tools (MADCOMs) use cognitive psychology and artificial
intelligence based persuasive techniques. These tools spread information, messages, and ideas
online, for influence, propaganda, counter-messaging, disinformation, espionage, intimidation.
They use human-like speech to dominate the information-space and capture the attention of
citizens.
Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies enable computers to simulate cognitive processes, such as
elements of human thinking. Machines can make decisions, perceive data or the environment, and
act to satisfy objectives.
The rule of the people, by the people, and for the people, requires citizens that can make decisions
in areas they do not always understand. When citizens understand the online environment, they
will be way more prepared to protect their families, their working environment, and their country.

B6. Cyber espionage, intellectual property theft, and the role of the Board.

 Overview
 Intelligence is the collection of information that have military, political, or economic value.
Intelligence refers to both:
- information that is collected by clandestine means,
- information available through conventional means.
Espionage is a set of intelligence gathering methods.
The Oxfords English Dictionary defines espionage as the practice of spying or of using spies, typically by governments, to obtain political and military information.
The Merriam-Webster's Dictionary has a slightly different opinion. Espionage is the practice of spying or using spies, to obtain information about the plans and activities especially of a foreign government or a competing company.
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) defines economic espionage as "the act of knowingly targeting or acquiring trade secrets to benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent."
According to the 2019 Situation Report of the Swiss Federal Intelligence Service (FIS): "Espionage is driven by a variety of different motives and has more than one aim. For example, states strive, using information obtained by their intelligence services, to gain a fuller picture of the situation in order to improve the effectiveness of their actions.
It can furthermore be observed that information is increasingly being procured with the aim of influencing (in so-called influence operations) or damaging the actions of rivals. Both can be achieved through the selective publication of information. The aim of such activities is often to weaken the cohesion of international groups or institutions and thereby to restrict their ability to act."
Cyber is a prefix used to describe new things that are now possible as a result of the spread of computers, systems, and devices, that are interconnected. It relates to data processing, data transfer, or information stored in systems.
With the word cyber we also refer to anything relating to computers, systems, and devices, especially the internet.
The prefix cyber has been added to a wide range of words, to describe new flavors of existing concepts, or new approaches to existing procedures.
Intelligence gathering involves human intelligence (HUMINT - information collected and provided by human sources), signals intelligence (SIGINT - information collected by interception of signals), imagery intelligence (IMINT), measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), open-source intelligence (OSINT), financial intelligence (FININT), etc.
HUMINT is the oldest form of intelligence gathering. Cyber-HUMINT refers to the strategies and practices used in cyberspace, in order to collect intelligence while attacking the human factor.
Cyber-HUMINT starts with traditional human intelligence processes (recruitment, training, intelligence gathering, deception etc.), combined with social engineering strategies and practices.
Cyber espionage includes:
- unauthorized access to systems or devices to obtain information,
- social engineering to the persons that have authorized access to systems or devices, to obtain information.
Cyber espionage involves cyber attacks to obtain political, commercial, and military information.
Cyber espionage and traditional espionage have similar or the same end goals. Cyber espionage exploits the anonymity, global reach, scattered nature, the interconnectedness of information networks, the deception opportunities that offer plausible deniability.
Economic and industrial espionage, including cyber espionage, represents a significant threat to a countrys prosperity, security, and competitive advantage. Cyberspace is a preferred operational domain for many threat actors, including countries, state sponsored groups, the organized crime, and individuals. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) introduce new vulnerabilities.
Cyber economic espionage is the targeting and theft of trade secrets and intellectual property. It is usually much larger in scale and scope, and it is a major drain on competitive advantage and market share.
According to Burton (2015), cyber threats can be classified into four main categories: Cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyberterrorism, and cyber warfare.
Cybercrime is crime enabled by or that targets computers. Criminal activities can be carried out by individuals or groups who have diverse goals such as financial gain, identity theft, and damaging property. Usually cybercrime is financially motivated.
Cyber espionage activities are conducted by state-sponsored cyber attackers "for the purpose of providing knowledge to the states to obtain political, commercial, and military gain" (Burton, 2015).
According to Denning, cyberterrorism is the convergence of cyberspace and terrorism" that covers politically motivated hacking and operations intended to cause grave harm such as loss of life or severe economic damage.
Cyber Warfare involves the use of computers and systems to target an enemys information systems. The use of cyber power in military operations is an important force multiplier. Since the armed forces are highly dependent on information technologies and computer networks, disruption of these systems would provide great advantages.
Cyberspace is regarded as the fifth domain of warfare after land, sea, air, and space. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced in June 2016 that the 28-member alliance has agreed to declare cyber an operational domain, much as the sea, air and land are.
According to the 2019 Situation Report of the Swiss Federal Intelligence Service (FIS): "Espionage operations which have come to light reveal that cyber tools and other communications reconnaissance instruments are being used in parallel and in interaction with human sources.
Depending on the objective, information is also being procured exclusively via cyberspace. The latter has gained in importance insofar as the use of cyber-based information-gathering tools has proven successful for many actors.
Cyber espionage is difficult to detect, the perpetrators can hardly be successfully prosecuted, as the purported country of origin does of course not help to elucidate the affair and determination by the means of intelligence of the origins of the cyber-attack (attribution) can simply be denied based on the lack of provability."
A major challenge today is the lack of awareness and training. Many organizations and companies continue to believe that cyber security is a technical, not a strategic discipline. They believe that cyber security involves the protection of systems from threats like unauthorized access, not the awareness and training of persons that have authorized access to systems and information.

B7. Steganography in business intelligence and intellectual property theft, and the role of the Board.

 Overview
 Steganography is the art and the science of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file, and communicating in a way that hides the existence of the message and the communication. For example, a message can be hidden inside a graphic image file, an audio file, or other file format, in a way that it is difficult for steganography experts and impossible for all the others to find it.
The word steganography comes from the Greek words  (covered or concealed) and  (write). Payload is the data that has been hidden, and carrier is whatever (like a file) hides the payload.
Steganography is different from cryptography. Cryptography is the art of secret writing, it makes a message unreadable by a third party, but it does not hide the existence of the message. Steganography is about concealing the message.
It is relatively easy to identify an encrypted file, but it is usually not so easy to decrypt it. The analysts might be able to identify the encryption method by examining the file header, identifying encryption programs installed on the system, or finding encryption keys (which are often stored on other media).
With steganography, everything is more complex and difficult. The analysts must first find the file that hides another encrypted file (looking for multiple versions of the same image, identifying the presence of grayscale images, searching metadata and registries, using histograms, and using hash sets to search for known steganography software), then the analysts might be able to extract the embedded data, and they still have to find the encryption key (as the hidden file is usually encrypted too).
Steganography can be very useful. Using digital watermarking, an author can embed a hidden message in a file so that ownership of the intellectual property can be proved. Artists can post artwork on a website, and if others claim the ownership of the work, the artists can prove ownership as they can recover the watermark. Steganography has also a number of nefarious applications. Criminals can easier hide records of illegal activity and financial crimes, and terrorists can easier exchange messages.
Steganalysis is the analysis of steganography, and involves the detection of hidden data, the extraction of the hidden message, and sometimes the alteration of the hidden message so that the recipient cannot extract it, or receive a different message.
Many steganalysis tools are signature-based (similar to antivirus and intrusion detection systems). There are also anomaly-based steganalysis systems, more flexible and better for new steganography techniques.
New complex steganography methods continue to emerge. Spread-spectrum steganography methods are similar to spread-spectrum radio transmissions (where the signal is spread across a wide-frequency spectrum rather than focused on a single frequency, in an effort to make detection and jamming more difficult). In spread-spectrum steganography, small distortions to images are less detectable in bright colors, so the hidden message is stored in bright colors only, not each color. You can also check the Biosteganography link at the top of the webpage.

Case study, steganography used in espionage, organized crime, and terrorism.
Consider the following scenario. Every Friday afternoon (for the target's time zone) a member of a foreign state-sponsored group puts an item for sale on eBay, and posts a photograph of the item. The item for sale is real, and it will be sold according to the rules of eBay. Bids are accepted, money is collected, and items are delivered. The photograph of the item hides a message, but this is just one from so many millions of photos that can be found at eBay. Anybody in the world can download the photo, but only members of the same foreign state-sponsored group know how to extract the encrypted message and how to decrypt it.

What can we do?
Corporate security and acceptable use policies, that detail what employees are authorized to do within the corporate environment, can always help and must be in the first line of defense. Awareness training for all employees, that explains the reasons they have to respect policies and includes the modus operandi and risks of steganography attacks is of paramount importance.
User policies explain what is prohibited, and they provide an organization with the legal means to punish or prosecute violators.
We must clearly explain in policies that every line of code or piece of software that is not approved, is strictly prohibited. In this way, we will avoid most of the following:
- anti-forensics tools (used to thwart digital forensic investigations, like drive wiping tools, cache and history erasers, file property and time alternators, VPNs, e-mail, and chat log erasers),
- encryption or steganography tools (there are over 1,000 free steganography tools online, most of them very dangerous for everybody that downloads the "free" tool, or even visits these websites. In some websites we read: "This application does not require installation. You can copy the program files to an external data device, so as to run it on any computer you can get your hands on, with just a click of the button. It is not adding new items to the Windows registry or hard drive without your approval, as installers usually do, and it will not leave any traces behind"),
- exploit kits (programs designed to exploit a known vulnerability in a piece of software or online resource. They are often distributed as a package, which will enable attackers with limited knowledge to launch a sophisticated attacks),
- toolkits (that enable unsophisticated users to construct new malware applications, sometimes not detectable by standard signature-based virus scanning engines),
- keyloggers (designed to covertly monitor keystrokes on a device. Once a device has been compromised, all keystrokes, including passwords, can be monitored, and recorded),
- password cracking tools (designed to break password-protected files and accounts),
- sniffers (that capture and analyze network traffic. Many protocols, including FTP and chat, are not encrypted. These programs obtain cleartext information, and also collect packets that can be used to crack network passwords and find protected files, servers, and user accounts),
- spyware tools (for industrial espionage, unauthorized monitoring, and collection of proprietary data),
- piracy tools (that allow users to bypass copyright protection in various forms of media, making illegal copies, and saving to a storage medium).
There are unlimited methods of steganography, only imagination is the limit. We usually learn about encrypted messages hidden in large files (images, sound files, videos etc.), and nothing more. Although steganography is usually considered a technical problem, it is not. It is also a business intelligence (or just intelligence) problem. If we do not know where to look for hidden messages, it is very unlikely to find them. Only the cooperation of the public and the private sector can protect against these security threats.

B8. Cyber Proxies and the role of the Board.

 Overview
  The word proxy is interesting. In Latin, procuro means manage, administer - from pro (on behalf of) and curo (I care for).
  Today a proxy is a person or entity who is authorized to act on behalf of another person or entity. 
  Countries expand their global intelligence footprint to better support their growing political, economic, and security interests around the world, increasingly challenging existing alliances and partnerships. They employ an array of tools, especially influence campaigns, to advance their interests or undermine the interests of other countries. They turn a power vacuum into an opportunity. 
  Countries use proxies (state-sponsored groups, organizations, organized crime, etc.) as a way to accomplish national objectives while limiting cost, reducing the risk of direct conflict, and maintaining plausible deniability.
  With plausible deniability, even if the target country is able to attribute an attack to an actor, it is unable to provide evidence that a link exists between the actor and the country that sponsors the attack.
  According to Tim Maurer, proxy is an intermediary that conducts or directly contributes to an offensive cyber operation that is enabled knowingly, actively or passively, by a beneficiary who gains advantage from its effect. 
  Cyber proxies are valuable actors in political warfare.  This is the employment of military, intelligence, diplomatic, financial, and other means, short of conventional war, to achieve national objectives. It encompasses the exploitation of computer networks and platforms, electronic warfare, psychological operations, and information operations.
  For some countries, the main battlespace is the mind. With information and psychological warfare, these countries can morally and psychologically depress the enemys armed forces personnel and civil population. 
  In 2019, the United States spent $732 billion on defense, compared to Russias $65.1 billion. It is obvious that Russia and other countries in similar position will try to find less expensive means to counter big, expensive U.S. weapons and systems.
		  Cyber espionage is especially economical when countries conduct activities through proxies. 
	Countries actively create fertile grounds for malicious activities to occur. Cyber actors (which include cyber criminals, hacktivists, and political, economic and religious groups) are continually operating from within the sphere of influence of the sponsoring country with the understanding that their illegal activities will be tolerated, as soon as they will also support the objectives of the sponsoring country.
 As John Carlin, former Assistant U.S. Attorney General for National Security has stated, what youre seeing is the worlds most sophisticated intelligence operations when it comes to cyber espionage, using the criminal groups for their intelligence ends, and protecting them from law enforcement.
  Cyber threats posed by cyber proxies must be managed, and the laws must be changed in this area. Publicly attributing malicious cyber activity to a country in a timely manner and holding that country accountable is difficult, but necessary. If international law is unable to solve these problems, national policies will ignore international law and confront cyber adversaries through rapid attribution and offensive countermeasures, to deter future aggression. 

COVID-19 and cyber proxies
 The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted life worldwide, with far-reaching effects that extend well beyond global health to the economic, political, and security spheres. The economic and political implications of the pandemic will ripple through the world for years. It is raising geopolitical tensions, and many countries try to take advantage of the situation and increase their influence. 
  The economic fallout from the pandemic is likely to create or worsen instability in many countries, as people face challenges that include economic downturns, job losses, and disrupted supply chains. Some hard-hit developing countries are experiencing financial and humanitarian crises, increasing the risk of surges in migration, collapsed governments, or internal conflict.
  The COVID-19 pandemic is prompting shifts in security priorities for countries around the world. As the public and the private sectors try to cut budgets, gaps are emerging in training and risk management. These gaps are likely to grow.
Cyber proxies consider the Covid-19 pandemic a major opportunity to spread a cyber pandemic and infodemics (disinformation campaigns that use the pandemic as a vector). They can influence citizens around the world to question the policies in many countries and divide the population. They can also attack the health care sector and the institutions involved in the management of the crisis, to make governments weaker in responding to the crisis. 
Cyber proxies love the new "work from home" policies, and the exponential digitalization of our lives for work, education, communication and entertainment. Moving activities online creates new opportunities for malicious actors.

NIS 2 Training for the Healthcare Industry


Overview
The NIS 2 Directive of the European Union entered into force the 16th of January, 2023. 
In Article 1 (subject matter of the NIS 2 Directive), we learn that NIS 2 lays down cybersecurity risk management measures and reporting obligations for entities of a type referred to in Annex I or II.
In Annex I (Sectors of High Criticality), we find that "Healthcare providers", "EU reference laboratories", "Entities carrying out research and development activities of medicinal products", "Entities manufacturing basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations", and "Entities manufacturing medical devices considered to be critical during a public health emergency" are in the scope of the NIS 2 Directive.

More about the scope of the NIS 2 Directive
In Annex I, we find:
Sector: Health.
 - Healthcare providers.
Note: Healthcare provider means any natural or legal person or any other entity legally providing healthcare on the territory of a Member State.
 - EU reference laboratories.
Note: In the area of public health or of the national prevention, preparedness and response plans, the European Commission designates EU reference laboratories to provide support to national reference laboratories.  The EU reference laboratories shall be responsible for coordinating the network of national reference laboratories, in particular, in the following areas:
 (a) reference diagnostics, including test protocols;
 (b) reference material resources;
 (c) external quality assessments;
 (d) scientific advice and technical assistance;
 (e) collaboration and research;
 (f) monitoring, alert notifications and support in outbreak response, including to emerging communicable diseases and pathogenic bacteria and viruses; 
 (g) training.
 - Entities carrying out research and development activities of medicinal products.
 - Entities manufacturing basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations referred to in section C division 21 of NACE Rev. 2.
 - Entities manufacturing medical devices considered to be critical during a public health emergency (public health emergency critical devices list).

Important note: This is an overview, not a detailed list of activities. Depending on their products or services, and where their products or services belong in NACE (the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Union), entities must carefully consider if they must comply with the NIS 2 Directive or not. 
For example, in the scope of the NIS 2 Directive, we have the activity "entities manufacturing basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations referred to in section C division 21 of NACE Rev. 2". 
We have to visit section C division 21 of NACE Rev. 2, and find: 
21.1 - Manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products. This class includes manufacture of medicinal active substances to be used for their pharmacological properties in the manufacture of medicaments: antibiotics, basic vitamins, salicylic and O-acetylsalicylic acids etc., processing of blood.
21.2 - Manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations. This class includes manufacture of medicaments: . antisera and other blood fractions . vaccines . diverse medicaments, including homeopathic preparations - manufacture of chemical contraceptive products for external use and hormonal contraceptive medicaments - manufacture of medical diagnostic preparations, including pregnancy tests - manufacture of radioactive in-vivo diagnostic substances - manufacture of biotech pharmaceuticals.
This class excludes: - manufacture of herb infusions (mint, vervain, chamomile etc.), see 10.83 - manufacture of dental fillings and dental cement, see 32.50 - manufacture of bone reconstruction cements, see 32.50 - manufacture of surgical drapes, see 32.50 - wholesale of pharmaceuticals, see 46.46 - retail sale of pharmaceuticals, see 47.73 - research and development for pharmaceuticals and biotech pharmaceuticals, see 72.1 - packaging of pharmaceuticals, see 82.92.

What does it mean for entities in the scope of the NIS 2 Directive?
According to Article 20 (Governance), the management bodies of essential and important entities must approve the cybersecurity risk-management measures taken by those entities, oversee its implementation, and can be held liable for infringements.
 According to Article 20, Member States shall ensure that the members of the management bodies of essential and important entities are required to follow training, and shall encourage essential and important entities to offer similar training to their employees on a regular basis, in order that they gain sufficient knowledge and skills to enable them to identify risks and assess cybersecurity risk-management practices and their impact on the services provided by the entity.
 According to Article 21 (Cybersecurity risk-management measures), essential and important entities must take appropriate and proportionate technical, operational and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of network and information systems which those entities use for their operations or for the provision of their services, and to prevent or minimise the impact of incidents on recipients of their services and on other services.
 Taking into account the "state-of-the-art" and, where applicable, relevant European and international standards, as well as the cost of implementation, the measures referred shall ensure a level of security of network and information systems appropriate to the risks posed. When assessing the proportionality of those measures, due account shall be taken of the degree of the entitys exposure to risks, the entitys size and the likelihood of occurrence of incidents and their severity, including their societal and economic impact.
 The measures shall be based on an "all-hazards approach" that aims to protect network and information systems and the physical environment of those systems from incidents, and shall include "at least" the following:
 (a) policies on risk analysis and information system security;
 (b) incident handling;
 (c) business continuity, such as backup management and disaster recovery, and crisis management;
 (d) supply chain security, including security-related aspects concerning the relationships between each entity and its direct suppliers or service providers;
 (e) security in network and information systems acquisition, development and maintenance, including vulnerability handling and disclosure;
 (f) policies and procedures to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk-management measures;
 (g) basic cyber hygiene practices and cybersecurity training;
 (h) policies and procedures regarding the use of cryptography and, where appropriate, encryption;
 (i) human resources security, access control policies and asset management;
 (j) the use of multi-factor authentication or continuous authentication solutions, secured voice, video and text communications and secured emergency communication systems within the entity, where appropriate.

There are no entry requirements or prerequisites for enrollment. Our programs give the opportunity to individuals of all levels to learn, grow, and develop new skills without the need for prior qualifications or specific experience. 


4. I want to learn more about the exam.
You can take the exam online from your home or office, in all countries. 
It is an open book exam. Risk and compliance management is something you must understand and learn, not memorize. You must acquire knowledge and skills, not commit something to memory.
You will be given 90 minutes to complete a 35-question exam. You must score 70% or higher. 
The exam contains only questions that have been clearly answered in the official presentations.
All exam questions are multiple-choice, composed of two parts: 
a. A stem (a question asked, or an incomplete statement to be completed).
b. Four possible responses.
In multiple-choice questions, you must not look for a correct answer, you must look for the best answer. Cross out all the answers you know are incorrect, then focus on the remaining ones. Which is the best answer? With this approach, you save time, and you greatly increase the likelihood of selecting the correct answer.
TIME LIMIT - This exam has a 90-minute time limit. You must complete this exam within this time limit, otherwise the result will be marked as an unsuccessful attempt.
BACK BUTTON - When taking this exam you are NOT permitted to move backwards to review/change prior answers. Your browser back button will refresh the current page instead of moving backward. 
RESTART/RESUME  You CANNOT stop and then resume the exam. If you stop taking this exam by closing your browser, your answers will be lost, and the result will be marked as an unsuccessful attempt.
SKIP - You CANNOT skip answering questions while taking this exam. You must answer all the questions in the order the questions are presented.
When you are ready to take the exam, you must follow the steps described at  "Question h. I am ready for the exam. What must I do?", at: 



5. How comprehensive are the presentations? Are they just bullet points?
The presentations are not bullet points. They are effective and appropriate to study online or offline.


6. Do I need to buy books to pass the exam?
No. If you study the presentations, you can pass the exam. All the exam questions are clearly answered in the presentations. If you fail the first time, you must study more. Print the presentations and use Post-it to attach notes, to know where to find the answer to a question.


7. Is it an open book exam? Why?
Yes, it is an open book exam. Risk and compliance management is something you must understand and learn, not memorize. You must acquire knowledge and skills, not commit something to memory.


8. Do I have to take the exam soon after receiving the presentations?
No. You can take the exam any time. Your account never expires. You have lifetime access to the training program. If there are any updates to the training material and you have not passed the exam, you will receive the updated program free of charge.


9. Do I have to spend more money in the future keep my certificate of completion valid?
No. Your certificate of completion will remain valid, without the need to spend money or to take another exam in the future.


10. Ok, the certificate of completion never expires, but things change.
Recertification would be a great recurring revenue stream for Cyber Risk GmbH, but it would also be a recurring expense for our clients. We resisted the temptation to "introduce multiple recurring revenue streams to keep business flowing", as we were consulted. No recertification is needed for our programs.
Things change, and this is the reason you need to visit the "Reading Room" of Cyber Risk GmbH every month, and read the monthly newsletter with updates, alerts, and opportunities, to stay current. You may visit: 


11. Which is your refund policy?
Cyber Risk GmbH has a very clear refund policy: You have the option to ask for a full refund up to 60 days after the payment. If you do not want one of our programs for any reason, all you must do is to send us an email, and we will refund the payment after one business day, no questions asked.


12. I want to receive a printed certificate. Can you send me one?
Unfortunately this is not possible. You will receive your certificate via email in Adobe Acrobat format (pdf), with a scannable QR code for verification, 7 business days after you pass the exam. A business day refers to any day in which normal business operations are conducted (in our case Monday through Friday), excluding weekends and public holidays. 
The association will develop a dedicated web page for each certified professional (https://www.cyber-risk-gmbh.com/Your_Name.html). In your dedicated web page we will add your full name, all the certificates you have received from the association, and the pictures of your certificates. 
When third parties scan the QR code on your certificate, they will visit your dedicated web page, and they will be able to verify that you are a certified professional, and your certificates are valid and legitimate. 
Professional certificates are some of the most frequently falsified documents. Employers and third parties need an easy, effective, and efficient way to check the authenticity of each certificate. QR code verification is a good response to this demand. 
You can print your certificate that you will receive in Adobe Acrobat format. With the scannable QR code, all third parties can verify the authenticity of each certificate in a matter of seconds. 


13. Why should I choose your training programs?
I. There are many new Directives and Regulations in the EU, and our target audience is overwhelmed and has little time to spare. Cyber Risk GmbH has developed training programs that can assist them in understanding the new requirements, and in providing evidence that they are qualified, as they must pass an exam to receive their certificate of completion. 
II. Our training programs are flexible and convenient. Learners can access the course material and take the exam at any time and from any location. This is especially important for those with busy schedules.
III. The all-inclusive cost of our programs is very low. There is no additional cost for each program, now or in the future, for any reason.
IV. If you purchase a second program, you have a $100 discount. The all-inclusive cost for your second (and each additional) program is $197.
V. There are 3 exam attempts per year that are included in the cost of each program, so you do not have to spend money again if you fail.
VI. No recertification is required. Your certificates of completion never expire.
VII.  If you purchase the NIS2DTP program now, you can receive all the updated and amended NIS2DTP programs  at no cost  until January 31, 2028. 
Every time we have important developments that affect regulatory compliance with the NIS 2 Directive (NIS2), we will update and amend this training program, especially when we have important: 
- Joint final draft technical standards,  from the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs)  the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
 - Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS), 
 - Implementing Technical Standards (ITS), 
 -  Delegated Acts, that supplement or amend nonessential parts of EU legislative acts, and 
 -  Implementing Acts, that ensure that EU laws are applied uniformly.			
VIII. The marketplace is clearly demanding qualified professionals in risk and compliance management. Certified professionals enjoy industry recognition and have more and better job opportunities.
IX. Firms and organizations hire and promote fit and proper professionals who can provide evidence that they are qualified. Employers need assurance that managers and employees have the knowledge and skills needed to mitigate risks and accept responsibility. Supervisors and auditors ask for independent evidence that the process owners are qualified, and that the controls can operate as designed, because the persons responsible for these controls have the necessary knowledge and experience.
X. Professionals that gain more skills and qualifications often become eligible for higher-paying roles. Investing in training can have a direct positive impact on a manager's or employee's earning potential.

Healthcare - Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER)


Overview
The Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER) of the European Union (Directive (EU) 2022/2557) strengthens the resilience of critical infrastructure to a range of threats, including natural hazards, terrorist attacks, insider threats, or sabotage. 11 sectors must comply with the new requirements: energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructures, health, drinking water, wastewater, digital infrastructure, public administration, space and food. 
 Deadlines: By 17 October 2024, Member States shall adopt and publish the measures necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof. 
They shall apply those measures from 18 October 2024.

Must the healthcare industry comply with the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER)?
According to Article 2 (Definitions) of the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER),  critical entity means a public or private entity which has been identified by a Member State as belonging to:
		  
		  
	5. Health. 

 Healthcare providers. 

 EU reference laboratories. 

 Entities carrying out research and development activities of medicinal products. 

 Entities manufacturing basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations. 

 Entities manufacturing medical devices considered to be critical during a public health emergency (public health emergency critical devices list). 

 8 December 2022 - The Council approved the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER) and a recommendation which aim to reduce the vulnerabilities and strengthen the resilience of critical entities. 
To respond to the recent acts of sabotage against the Nord Stream pipeline and the new risks brought by Russias aggression against Ukraine, the recommendation adopted focuses on strengthening the resilience of critical infrastructure.
This recommendation aims to accelerate the preparatory work for the implementation of the objectives set out in the critical entities and NIS 2 directives and step up the EUs capacity to protect its critical infrastructure. It includes series of targeted actions covering key sectors such as energy, digital infrastructure, transport and space.
The recommendation covers three priority areas: preparedness, response and international cooperation. It invites member states to update their risk assessments to reflect current threats and encourages them to conduct stress tests of entities operating critical infrastructure, with the energy sector as a priority. 
It also calls on member states to develop, in cooperation with the Commission, a blueprint for a coordinated response to disruptions of critical infrastructure with significant cross-border relevance. The EU will support partner countries in enhancing their resilience and strengthen cooperation with NATO in this area.

According to Article 1 (Subject matter and scope), the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER):
(a) lays down obligations on Member States to take specific measures aimed at ensuring 
that services which are essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions or 
economic activities are provided in an unobstructed manner in the internal market, in particular obligations to identify 
critical entities and to support critical entities in meeting the obligations imposed on 
them;
(b) lays down obligations for critical entities aimed at enhancing their resilience and
ability to provide services in the internal market;
(c) establishes rules:
(i) on the supervision of critical entities;
(ii) on enforcement;
(iii) for the identification of critical entities of particular European significance and 
on advisory missions to assess the measures that such entities have put in place 
to meet their obligations under Chapter III;
(d) establishes common procedures for cooperation and reporting on the application of 
this Directive;
(e) lays down measures with a view to achieving a high level of resilience of critical 
entities in order to ensure the provision of essential services within the Union and to 
improve the functioning of the internal market.

2. Critical Entities Resilience Directive Trained Professional (CERDTPro) - online training, exam, certificate of completion.

Overview
With which Directive do we have to comply? The Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER), the NIS 2 Directive, or another legal act?
The NIS 2 Directive (2022/2555) addresses cybersecurity challenges. Cybersecurity is addressed sufficiently in the NIS 2 Directive, so the matters covered by the NIS 2 Directive are excluded from the scope of the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER). To make it as clear as possible, for cybersecurity challenges the NIS 2 Directive applies, given that the requirements laid down in the NIS 2 Directive are at least equivalent to the corresponding obligations laid down in the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER).
 Where provisions of sector-specific Union legal acts require critical entities to take measures to enhance their resilience, and where those requirements are recognised by Member States as at least equivalent to the corresponding obligations laid down in the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER), the relevant provisions of the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER) should not apply. The relevant provisions of sector-specific legal acts should apply. 
 What about challenges that affect both, the physical security and cybersecurity of critical entities? NIS 2 and CER will both be implemented in a coordinated manner, according to article 1.2 of the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER).
 CER covers a wide range or risks, not just cybersecurity risks. According to Article 13 of CER, (Resilience measures of critical entities), critical entities must take technical, security and organisational measures to ensure their resilience,  including measures necessary to:
(a) prevent incidents from occurring, duly considering disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation measures;
(b) ensure adequate physical protection of their premises and critical infrastructure, duly considering, for example, fencing, barriers, perimeter monitoring tools and routines, detection equipment and access controls;
(c) respond to, resist and mitigate the consequences of incidents, duly considering the implementation of risk and crisis management procedures and protocols and alert routines;
(d) recover from incidents, duly considering business continuity measures and the identification of alternative supply chains, in order to resume the provision of the essential service;
(e) ensure adequate employee security management, duly considering measures such as setting out categories of personnel who exercise critical functions, establishing access rights to premises, critical infrastructure and sensitive information, setting up procedures for background checks in accordance with Article 14 and designating the categories of persons who are required to undergo such background checks, and laying down appropriate training requirements and qualifications;
(f) raise awareness about the measures referred to in points (a) to (e) among relevant personnel, duly considering training courses, information materials and exercises.

There are no entry requirements or prerequisites for enrollment. Our programs give the opportunity to individuals of all levels to learn, grow, and develop new skills without the need for prior qualifications or specific experience. 


4. I want to learn more about the exam.
You can take the exam online from your home or office, in all countries. 
It is an open book exam. Risk and compliance management is something you must understand and learn, not memorize. You must acquire knowledge and skills, not commit something to memory.
You will be given 90 minutes to complete a 35-question exam. You must score 70% or higher. 
The exam contains only questions that have been clearly answered in the official presentations.
All exam questions are multiple-choice, composed of two parts: 
a. A stem (a question asked, or an incomplete statement to be completed).
b. Four possible responses.
In multiple-choice questions, you must not look for a correct answer, you must look for the best answer. Cross out all the answers you know are incorrect, then focus on the remaining ones. Which is the best answer? With this approach, you save time, and you greatly increase the likelihood of selecting the correct answer.
TIME LIMIT - This exam has a 90-minute time limit. You must complete this exam within this time limit, otherwise the result will be marked as an unsuccessful attempt.
BACK BUTTON - When taking this exam you are NOT permitted to move backwards to review/change prior answers. Your browser back button will refresh the current page instead of moving backward. 
RESTART/RESUME  You CANNOT stop and then resume the exam. If you stop taking this exam by closing your browser, your answers will be lost, and the result will be marked as an unsuccessful attempt.
SKIP - You CANNOT skip answering questions while taking this exam. You must answer all the questions in the order the questions are presented.
When you are ready to take the exam, you must follow the steps described at  "Question h. I am ready for the exam. What must I do?", at: 



5. How comprehensive are the presentations? Are they just bullet points?
The presentations are not bullet points. They are effective and appropriate to study online or offline.


6. Do I need to buy books to pass the exam?
No. If you study the presentations, you can pass the exam. All the exam questions are clearly answered in the presentations. If you fail the first time, you must study more. Print the presentations and use Post-it to attach notes, to know where to find the answer to a question.


7. Is it an open book exam? Why?
Yes, it is an open book exam. Risk and compliance management is something you must understand and learn, not memorize. You must acquire knowledge and skills, not commit something to memory.


8. Do I have to take the exam soon after receiving the presentations?
No. You can take the exam any time. Your account never expires. You have lifetime access to the training program. If there are any updates to the training material and you have not passed the exam, you will receive the updated program free of charge.


9. Do I have to spend more money in the future keep my certificate of completion valid?
No. Your certificate of completion will remain valid, without the need to spend money or to take another exam in the future.


10. Ok, the certificate of completion never expires, but things change.
Recertification would be a great recurring revenue stream for Cyber Risk GmbH, but it would also be a recurring expense for our clients. We resisted the temptation to "introduce multiple recurring revenue streams to keep business flowing", as we were consulted. No recertification is needed for our programs.
Things change, and this is the reason you need to visit the "Reading Room" of Cyber Risk GmbH every month, and read the monthly newsletter with updates, alerts, and opportunities, to stay current. You may visit: 


11. Which is your refund policy?
Cyber Risk GmbH has a very clear refund policy: You have the option to ask for a full refund up to 60 days after the payment. If you do not want one of our programs for any reason, all you must do is to send us an email, and we will refund the payment after one business day, no questions asked.


12. I want to receive a printed certificate. Can you send me one?
Unfortunately this is not possible. You will receive your certificate via email in Adobe Acrobat format (pdf), with a scannable QR code for verification, 7 business days after you pass the exam. A business day refers to any day in which normal business operations are conducted (in our case Monday through Friday), excluding weekends and public holidays. 
Cyber Risk GmbH will develop a dedicated web page for each professional (https://www.cyber-risk-gmbh.com/Your_Name.html). In your dedicated web page we will add your full name, all the certificates you have received from Cyber Risk GmbH, and the pictures of your certificates. 
When third parties scan the QR code on your certificate, they will visit your dedicated web page, and they will be able to verify that you are a certified professional, and your certificates are valid and legitimate. 
Professional certificates are some of the most frequently falsified documents. Employers and third parties need an easy, effective, and efficient way to check the authenticity of each certificate. QR code verification is a good response to this demand. 
You can print your certificate that you will receive in Adobe Acrobat format. With the scannable QR code, all third parties can verify the authenticity of each certificate in a matter of seconds. 


13. Why should I choose your training programs?
I. There are many new Directives and Regulations in the EU, and our target audience is overwhelmed and has little time to spare. Cyber Risk GmbH has developed training programs that can assist them in understanding the new requirements, and in providing evidence that they are qualified, as they must pass an exam to receive their certificate of completion. 
II. Our training programs are flexible and convenient. Learners can access the course material and take the exam at any time and from any location. This is especially important for those with busy schedules.
III. The all-inclusive cost of our programs is very low. There is no additional cost for each program, now or in the future, for any reason.
IV. If you purchase a second program, you have a $100 discount. The all-inclusive cost for your second (and each additional) program is $197.
V. There are 3 exam attempts per year that are included in the cost of each program, so you do not have to spend money again if you fail.
VI. No recertification is required. Your certificates of completion never expire.
VII.  If you purchase the CERDTPro program now, you can receive all the updated and amended CERDTPro programs  at no cost  until January 31, 2028. 
Every time we have important developments that affect regulatory compliance with the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER), we will update and amend this training program, especially when we have important: 
- Joint final draft technical standards,  from the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs)  the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
 - Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS), 
 - Implementing Technical Standards (ITS), 
 -  Delegated Acts, that supplement or amend nonessential parts of EU legislative acts, and 
 -  Implementing Acts, that ensure that EU laws are applied uniformly.			
VIII. The marketplace is clearly demanding qualified professionals in risk and compliance management. Certified professionals enjoy industry recognition and have more and better job opportunities.
IX. Firms and organizations hire and promote fit and proper professionals who can provide evidence that they are qualified. Employers need assurance that managers and employees have the knowledge and skills needed to mitigate risks and accept responsibility. Supervisors and auditors ask for independent evidence that the process owners are qualified, and that the controls can operate as designed, because the persons responsible for these controls have the necessary knowledge and experience.
X. Professionals that gain more skills and qualifications often become eligible for higher-paying roles. Investing in training can have a direct positive impact on a manager's or employee's earning potential.

 EU, Founding agreements  
The European Union is based on the rule of law. This means that every action taken by the EU is founded on treaties that have been approved voluntarily and democratically by all EU member countries. For example, if a policy area is not cited in a treaty, the Commission cannot propose a law in that area.
A treaty is a binding agreement between EU member countries. It sets out EU objectives, rules for EU institutions, how decisions are made and the relationship between the EU and its member countries.
Treaties are amended to make the EU more efficient and transparent, to prepare for new member countries and to introduce new areas of cooperation  such as the single currency.
Under the treaties, EU institutions can adopt legislation, which the member countries then implement. The complete texts of treaties, legislation, case law and legislative proposals can be viewed using the EUR-Lex database of EU law.


 The European Council  
In the Council of the EU, informally also known as the Council, government ministers from each EU country meet to discuss, amend and adopt laws, and coordinate policies. The ministers have the authority to commit their governments to the actions agreed on in the meetings.

The Council of the European Union:

 - negotiates and adopts EU laws, together with the European Parliament, based on proposals from the European Commission

 - coordinates EU countries' policies

 - develops the EU's foreign & security policy, based on European Council guidelines

 - concludes agreements between the EU and other countries or international organisations

 - adopts the annual EU budget - jointly with the European Parliament




 The European Commission 
The Commission is steered by a group of 27 Commissioners, known as 'the college'. Together they take decisions on the Commission's political and strategic direction.
A new college of Commissioners is appointed every 5 years.
The Commission is organised into policy departments, known as Directorates-General (DGs), which are responsible for different policy areas. DGs develop, implement and manage EU policy, law, and funding programmes. In addition, service departments deal with particular administrative issues. Executive agencies manage programmes set up by the Commission.


 The European Parliament 
The European Parliament is an important forum for political debate and decision-making at the EU level. The Members of the European Parliament are directly elected by voters in all Member States to represent peoples interests with regard to EU law-making and to make sure other EU institutions are working democratically.
The Parliament acts as a co-legislator, sharing with the Council the power to adopt and amend legislative proposals and to decide on the EU budget. It also supervises the work of the Commission and other EU bodies and cooperates with national parliaments of EU countries to get their input. See how it all works here.


 The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) 
Since the establishment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in 1952, its mission has been to ensure that "the law is observed" "in the interpretation and application" of the Treaties.
As part of that mission, the Court of Justice of the European Union:
 - reviews the legality of the acts of the institutions of the European Union,
 - ensures that the Member States comply with obligations under the Treaties, and
 - interprets European Union law at the request of the national courts and tribunals.
The Court thus constitutes the judicial authority of the European Union and, in cooperation with the courts and tribunals of the Member States, it ensures the uniform application and interpretation of EU law.
The Court of Justice of the European Union, which has its seat in Luxembourg, consists of two courts: the Court of Justice and the General Court (created in 1988). The Civil Service Tribunal, established in 2004, ceased to operate on 1 September 2016 after its jurisdiction was transferred to the General Court in the context of the reform of the European Unions judicial structure.
As each Member State has its own language and specific legal system, the Court of Justice of the European Union is a multilingual institution. Its language arrangements have no equivalent in any other court in the world, since each of the official languages of the European Union can be the language of a case. The Court is required to observe the principle of multilingualism in full, because of the need to communicate with the parties in the language of the proceedings and to ensure that its case-law is disseminated throughout the Member States.


 The European Court of Auditors  
The Court of Auditors shall carry out the Unions audit (TFEU, Article 285). 
The TFEU confers upon the European Court of Auditors the main task of carrying out the Unions audit with the dual aim of improving financial management and reporting to the citizens of Europe on the use made of public funds by the authorities responsible for their management.


 The European Ombudsman
Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, Article 228: "A European Ombudsman, elected by the European Parliament, shall be empowered to receive complaints from any citizen of the Union or any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State concerning instances of maladministration in the activities of the Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, with the exception of the Court of Justice of the European Union acting in its judicial role. He or she shall examine such complaints and report on them.

In accordance with his duties, the Ombudsman shall conduct inquiries for which he finds grounds, either on his own initiative or on the basis of complaints submitted to him direct or through a Member of the European Parliament, except where the alleged facts are or have been the subject of legal proceedings. Where the Ombudsman establishes an instance of maladministration, he shall refer the matter to the institution, body, office or agency concerned, which shall have a period of three months in which to inform him of its views. The Ombudsman shall then forward a report to the European Parliament and the institution, body, office or agency concerned. The person lodging the complaint shall be informed of the outcome of such inquiries."


The European Central Bank (ECB)  
The European Central Bank works to keep prices stable in the euro area. They contribute to the safety and soundness of the European banking system. 
The ECB is the central bank of the 19 European Union countries which use the euro. 
The first step towards creating the ECB was the decision, taken in 1988, to build an Economic and Monetary Union: free capital movements within Europe, a common monetary authority, and a single monetary policy across the euro area countries.


 The European External Action Service (EEAS)  
The European External Action Service (EEAS) is the European Unions diplomatic service. Since 2011, the EEAS carries out the EUs Common Foreign and Security Policy to promote peace, prosperity, security, and the interests of Europeans across the globe. 
The EU maintains diplomatic relations with nearly all countries in the world and undertakes a range of actions with strategic partners, key international players, and emerging and developing powers. 
In an increasingly interconnected world, Europes security starts abroad. European citizens expect and deserve to live in a safe and stable environment. In the face of increased global instability, the EU takes more responsibility for its own security and increase its capacity to act autonomously.


 The Delegation of the European Union in the United States of America  
The European Union is represented in the United States by the Washington, D.C, Delegation, which works in close coordination with the nearby embassies of the EU Member States.
The Delegation promotes EU policies in the United States, which includes presenting and explaining EU actions to the U.S. Administration and Congress. By engaging with political actors, the media, academia, business, and civil society, we raise awareness of EU issues and concerns and promote the importance of the EU-U.S relationship among the American public. 
The Delegation reports on the political, social, and economic situations in the United States to the headquarters in Brussels. Since 1964, the EU has also maintained an office in New York, serving as the EUs Mission to the United Nations.
