Operations underpinning realtime SNN execution are presented, including an event-based operating system facilitating efficient time-driven neuron state updates and pipelined event-driven spike processing. Preprocessing, realtime execution, and neuron/synapse model implementations are discussed, all in the context of a simple example SNN. Simulation results are demonstrated, together with performance profiling providing insights into how software interacts with the underlying hardware to achieve realtime execution. System performance is shown to be within a factor of 2 of the original design target of 10,000 synaptic events per millisecond, however SNN topology is shown to influence performance considerably. A cost model is therefore developed characterizing the effect of network connectivity and SNN partitioning. This model enables users to estimate SNN simulation performance, allows the SpiNNaker team to make predictions on the impact of performance improvements, and helps demonstrate the continued potential of the SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware.
Modelling and simulationThe pipeline ingests data from multiple measurement types of spatially organized neuronal activity, such as ECoG or calcium imaging recordings. The pipeline returns statistical measures to quantify the dynamic wave-like activity patterns found in the data. Individual parts of the snakemake-based pipeline are fully configurable.

It has functions that are tailored for conveniently controlling simulations, and presenting the results of real neurophysiological problems graphically in ways that are quickly and intuitively grasped. Instead of forcing users to reformulate their conceptual models to fit the requirements of a general purpose simulator, NEURON is designed to let them deal directly with familiar neuroscience concepts. Consequently, users can think in terms of the biophysical properties of membrane and cytoplasm, the branched architecture of neurons, and the effects of synaptic communication between cells.

The combination of brain research with supercomputing in large-scale, multi-disciplinary research collaborations has enabled an innovative approach to deciphering the brain, using powerful scientific technologies and data ressources. These developments open up new possibilities for brain research, medicine and technology. A position paper by over 100 authors, now published in the journal Imaging Neuroscience, summarises the current status and identifies the key points for further developments in digital neuroscience.Digital technologies have fundamentally changed neuroscience in recent years. The challenges posed by increasingly large and complex data have been met with innovative shared platforms and novel tools for scientific investigation. Large-scale research initiatives within Europe and worldwide have shaped these developments and enabled synergies in scientific efforts. Examples include the EU Flagship , and its digital research infrastructure EBRAINS, which enable scientists to integrate data from different scales according to FAIR principles, use models and software at EBRAINS for gaining new insights and working collaboratively on a larger scale. This change has led to significant progress and offers the opportunity to advance neuroscience, medicine and brain-inspired technologies.Against this background, the position paper titled  is primarily intended as a roadmap for digital neuroscience over the next ten years."It is crucial that we assess, anticipate and shape the changes occuring in neuroscience and its related fields. The position paper identifies points of convergence and common goals, and provides a scientific framework for current and future developments in digital brain research based on a structured process of discussion with the research community at large."Prof. Katrin AmuntsDirector at the Jlich Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine and Joint CEO of EBRAINSThe position paper lists a total of eight key areas for digital neuroscience research. Near-term, middle-term and long-term goals are discussed, as well as novel developments like digital twin-approaches, with their applicability, potential and limitations in brain science. A digital twin is a type of personalised computational brain model that can be continuously updated with measured data obtained from its real-life counterpart, i.e., the patient. While not aimed at being an exact replica, the increasing sophistication and predictive power of these models is bringing new clinical and research applications into reach.Further key areas described in the paper include ultra-high-resolution digital atlases and models of the brain that integrate multiple scales and modalities, neuro-derived artificial intelligence (AI) and computing innovations. EBRAINS has a key role in the interaction between brain research and computing, offering scientists access to the most powerful European supercomputers via the computing network  and to the brain-inspired computing systems  and . An  has been published on the website of the EBRAINS research infrastructure.How the position paper came aboutTwo years ago, the HBP initiated an open and community-driven process integrating the views of researchers around the world. A first version by around 40 authors was published on the open publication platform  in March 2022 with a call to scientists, in particular outside the HBP, to contribute further perspectives. Input from new authors led to new versions published in regular intervals and promoted for further comment. The fifth and final version has now been published in the journal Imaging Neuroscience with the contribution of over 100 authors, not only from Europe, but also from the USA, Canada and Asia.

In this interview, the lead author, internationally renowned brain researcher Prof. Katrin Amunts, gives an insight into the content and origins of the paper.Prof. Katrin Amunts is Director at the Jlich Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Director of the Ccile and Oskar Vogt Institute for Brain Research at Heinrich Heine University Dsseldorf and Joint CEO of EBRAINS. From 2016 to 2023, she was Scientific Director of the Human Brain Project.Prof. Amunts, why is brain research so demanding?Katrin Amunts: The brain is one of the most complex systems known to man. We study the brain on several spatial and temporal scales - from individual molecules to the whole brain and subject-level. Furthermore, it changes and adapts throughout life - this happens within milliseconds to over the entire lifespan. The many different scales must be considered together to develop a comprehensive understanding of brain structure and function.What changes have had a decisive impact on neuroscience in recent years?The way in which brain research is conducted has changed fundamentally. Digital technologies and new instruments, tools and methods have transformed the field. One example is our three-dimensional brain atlas, which has now become a kind of Google Maps. It does not only offer detailed maps of the brain, but also a large amount of data and software to work with. Digitalisation has opened many doors between the silos of the various subdisciplines in brain research and brain-related fields in recent years. In addition, new, large-scale collaborations within Europe and worldwide are creating synergies based on the shared use of data and instruments. They thus take account of the great dynamism in research. The change has led to important advances and opens up new opportunities to advance brain research, medicine and brain-inspired technologies.What is the background of the creation of the position paper?The development of new digital methods is changing research rapidly, and in the case of AI and most recently, large language models, this is happening faster than many of us expected. These advances were made possible by stronger and more powerful computers, and digitalisation. We now have the basis to delve much deeper into research. At the same time, this also opens up new questions. It is crucial that we evaluate, anticipate and help shape such developments. In this way, we can maximize the opportunities and overcome the challenges of the next decade for research and its application, taking into account the ethical and social aspects. The paper provides the framework for this, a kind of "scientific roadmap".The position paper was developed in several stages. How exactly?Two years ago, the HBP initiated an open and collaborative exchange of scientific opinions and data for researchers around the world, resulting in the position paper that has now been published. A first version by around 40 scientists was published on the open publication platform  in March 2022, with a call for researchers outside the HBP in particular to contribute further perspectives. The paper grew from edition to edition. The fifth and final version with over 100 authors has now been published in the journal Imaging Neuroscience. They come not only from Europe, but also from the USA, Canada and Asia.What are examples of goals for digital neuroscience in the coming decade?The paper identifies a total of eight key areas for research. One example of a medical application is the so-called "digital twin": twins are computer-based, mathematical brain models that can be continuously updated with measurement data. They are not as similar to the original as they sound, as a model always means an abstraction. But even simplified models can help us to better understand specific mechanisms and are making predictions that can be clinically relevant. Personalized models will increasingly enable us to improve diagnostics and therapy. For example, research originating from the HBP is the basis to investigate the use of the "digital twin" for better planning of surgical interventions for epilepsy. Virtual brains also enable us to test fundamental research hypotheses about the organization of our most complex organ, and at the same time pave the way for innovative neuro-inspired technologies.What role does the EBRAINS research infrastructure play in this?EBRAINS emerged from the work of the HBP. This new digital and collaborative research infrastructure enables the integration of data provided by different research groups from different countries and with different approaches and makes it accessible to others for their research projects. EBRAINS offers a wide range of different digital tools and services to support neuroscientists, that can be combined in a flexible way. Compute- and data- intensive workflows can make use of powerful European supercomputers such as those of the Jlich Supercomputing Center JSC, the CEA in France or CINECA in Italy, which are part of a dedicated compute infrastructure called Fenix.What will be the relation between artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscientific research over the next ten years?AI-based methods are becoming a more and more powerful tool for neuroscientists. Foundation models are changing research in a way that is expected to address completely new questions. At the same time, we should explore how to overcome some of the limits that these methods have, e.g., by learning from the brain. Such a transfer has happened already. Some neuro-inspired networks have already shown remarkable characteristics, for example, they learn faster and with less training data. Findings from brain research are also being applied to the development of new hardware - for example, in BrainScaleS and SpiNNaker, which are among the most powerful neuromorphic systems today. They emerged from the HBP and have shown very intriguing advantages in domains like real-time processing and energy efficiency. Now they are available on EBRAINS.Original publication:K. Amunts  L.

IMAGE: Heidelberg UniversityIn a new study enabled by the EBRAINS research infrastructure, a team at Heidelberg University (Germany) made advances in the field of neuromorphic engineering, enhancing the platform BrainScaleS-2 and paving the way for high-speed robotics.Their work, detailed in a , introduced a real-time spike interface to the neuromorphic platform BrainScaleS-2 (BSS-2). This innovation enables advancements in high-speed robotics applications, due to a 1,000-fold acceleration of the emulated nerve cells.The biological brain shows very high speed and efficiency when processing complex operations and enabling cognitive functions. Neuromorphic computing tries to replicate aspects of the structure and function of the brain to achieve this efficiency, and holds promise for robotics applications.Robotics can benefit from spiking neural networks (SNNs) due to them being more energy-efficient than traditional neural networks, and because their biological inspiration can lead to better cognitive capabilities in robotics systems. SNNs are also capable of processing information in precise timing, which is crucial for tasks such as motion detection or speech recognition in robotics.The BrainScaleS-2 system is a neuromorphic platform with versatile applications in the fields of computational neuroscience and spike-based machine learning. It is based on emulations of neurons, running at 1,000x biological real-time speed and available as a single-chip system. This acceleration allows the system to tackle robotic tasks far beyond human speed, enabling precise timing on a microsecond scale. Researchers have free access to the system via .In a demonstration of the capabilities of this new interface, the researchers used machine-learning techniques to train a spiking neural network (SNN)  an artificial neural network that mimics a biological one  emulated on the BSS-2 platform to control a type of electric motor.Yannik Stradmann, a researcher at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics (Heidelberg University) and author of the paper, emphasises the versatility of the newly enhanced system: The interaction of an artificial brain, processing information 1,000 times faster than humans, with the real world gives rise to many interesting scientific and technological questions. We envision this platform to enable future research on self-supervised and biologically inspired online learning for such applications.The interaction of an artificial brain, processing information 1,000 times faster than humans, with the real world gives rise to many interesting scientific and technological questions.
