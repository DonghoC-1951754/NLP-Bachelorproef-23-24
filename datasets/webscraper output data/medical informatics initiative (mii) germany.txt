MII was created to close the gap between research and healthcare.
The medical informatics initiative will unfold in three distinct phases. The first began in 2016, and the last is slated to end in 2026.
The aim of the medical informatics initiative is to ensure that, in the future, each doctor, patient and researcher has access to the information they require  while simultaneously allowing individuals to maintain control over their personal data.
The goal is to establish a way to exchange research and care data across university hospitals. If it proves successful  with the help of funding from BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research)  it will open up entirely new horizons. The solutions that will be developed are expected to create added value across the health system.

Medical Informatics Initiative


              Strengthening research and advancing healthcare             






The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) launched its medical informatics funding scheme to make data from healthcare and research more useful and meaningful. It provides around 500 million euros with the aim of strengthening medical research and improving patient care. All of Germanys university hospitals have joined forces with research institutions, businesses, health insurers, and patient advocacy groups to create a framework that harnesses research findings to the direct benefit of patients. 







At the German Portal for Medical Research Data (FDPG), researchers can centrally request access to health data and biospecimen from German university medicine for scientific research.


 








With the newsletter "MII Insights" the Medical Informatics Initiative provides regular information on project progress and results of the joint collaboration. The newsletter is only available in German language.











The Medical Informatics Initiative published a website to provide patients with clear and understandable information about the use of health data for medical research purposes.











With the online training platform "MII-Academy", researchers learn how to apply for and analyse medical data for their research project.


























              Template text for patient consent forms            


The conference of all German federal and state level data protection authorities has agreed on a uniform template text for patient consent forms for research with pseudonymised patient data - a milestone for Germany as a research centre. 

 







              Core data set            


All university hospitals have agreed on a shared core data set to be maintained as a minimum for all relevant patient data  irrespective of indication and of the research consortiums defined use case. This entails not just defined requirements for the scope of data, but also with regard to standardisation of medical content in line with international standards. 

 







              Contractual framework            


The MII member university hospitals have developed and agreed a contract that governs the terms and conditions of cross-site use of patient data and biosamples in individual cases within the scope of the MII.

About the initiative










              The medical informatics initiative was created to close the gap between research and healthcare. All of Germanys university hospitals have joined forces with research institutions, businesses, health insurers, and patient advocacy groups to create a framework that harnesses research findings to the direct benefit of patients.             




Consortia and participants of the Medical Informatics InitiativeThe digitisation of medicine is creating new opportunities for patient care and research; BMBF launched its medical informatics initiative to make the most of this transformation. In the initiatives first phase, university hospitals and partner organisations established and linked data integration centres. These centres allow research and healthcare data to be aggregated and integrated across multiple entities and sites. At the same time, innovative IT solutions for specific medical applications will be developed to demonstrate the benefits of high-tech digital healthcare services and infrastructures.Participating university hospitals and their partners have formed consortia. These are tasked with developing strategies for shared data use and exchange. They subsequently establish the data integration centres, and create IT solutions for concrete use cases.The BMBF is funding the consortia, data integration centres and the cross-consortia use cases with a total of more than 400 million euros in the establishment and networking phase (2018 to 2022) and the currently ongoing consolidation and extension phase (2023 to 2026).These activities are coordinated by a  (NSG), to ensure the interoperability of IT systems and data integration centres between the consortia. In addition, a dedicated coordination office supports cross-consortia collaboration. This office is managed jointly by   Technology, Methods and Infrastructure for Networked Medical Research,  (Medizinischer Fakulttentag  an association of German medical faculties), and  (Verband der Universtittsklinika Deutschlands, which represents 33 university hospitals in Germany).VisionThe aim of the medical informatics initiative is to ensure that, in future, each doctor, patient and researcher has access to the information they require  while simultaneously allowing individuals to maintain control over their personal data.This will lead to more precise diagnostics, and better treatment decisions. It will yield new insights for research and medicine. And it will improve patient care and help combat diseases more effectively. Specifically, the initiative is about harnessing the flood of data generated every single day in healthcare and research environments  to the benefit of individual patients, to better understand illnesses, and to tailor treatments to the needs of the individual.The goal is to establish a way to exchange research and care data across university hospitals. If it proves successful  with the help of funding from BMBF  it will open up entirely new horizons. The solutions that will be developed are expected to create added value across the health system.Digitisation can make personalised medicine a reality. But we have to make the switch now. Digital products and applications, not only in healthcare but also in medical research, are generating more and more data, and at an accelerating pace. These data must be aggregated and analysed  then they can help us to better understand and treat diseases. Our goal is a learning, digital and connected health system, where the right information is available at the right time, to the right person. With the launch of the medical informatics initiative, weve taken a major step in the right direction.Federal Minister of Education and Research Johanna Wanka | Download information leaflets: [PDF | 300 KB] [PDF | 296 KB]Interview film with patients, doctors and researchers:

Goals










              The aim of the Medical Informatics Initiative of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research is to make data from routine care available digitally, reliably and quickly for medical research. Through IT-supported analyses of this data, research helps to better recognise and treat diseases and to prevent them as effectively as possible. In the future, information about comparable medical cases or the results of current studies can also be made available to the treating physicians. In this way, this information can be used for the best possible therapy decision.             

Consolidating patient-oriented clinical data
Patients often visit multiple doctors and hospitals. However, medical professionals are not always informed of the latest treatments or diagnoses made by their peers on other premises. Where the patient has given informed consent, relevant data will be consolidated digitally. This will provide doctors with a better, more complete picture of the patients situation and the progression of their illness. The result will be improved treatment and increased patient safety  because diagnoses will be faster and more precise, an unnecessary second examination can be avoided, and unwanted side effects from medication prevented, for example.
Establishing the IT framework for tailored treatments
For the best results, it is vital to choose the right therapy for the specific patient. New technologies enable increasingly personalised patient characterisation. And this, in turn, allows medical professionals to determine the best approach to treating the patient prior to starting the therapy. These highly tailored treatments have the potential to raise success rates and curb side effects. However, this requires doctors to be adept at managing large volumes of data. In addition, it entails the analysis of patient data in the context of systems medicine, to lead to reliable insights and clear treatment choices. Against this background, methods from clinical epidemiology, medical statistics and biometry, and bioinformatics must be leveraged to develop corresponding evidence-based decision support systems.
Acquiring insights from patient data
Data generated from routine clinical practice in Germany are rarely used for research. And yet combining data sets from research (e.g. biobanks, genetic databases, data from studies) and patient care can reveal correlations  between genes, lifestyles, diseases or complications, for instance. The combined use of data fuels innovation in diagnostics, treatment and prevention. In addition, large sets of clinical data may help doctors to quickly recognise rare complications, risks and side effects, for example from drug therapies. Plus, more data are available for researching rare diseases.
Making new findings immediately available for patient care
Currently, it often takes too long to apply proven scientific findings to patient care. In many cases, recently acquired knowledge is not universally available to inform treatment decisions. Therefore, a key aim of the medical informatics initiative is to help ensure verified research findings are quickly brought to the bedside.
Strengthening medical informatics in Germany
Growing volumes of data can only be effectively analysed with the aid of specialised data scientists  who wield state-of-the-art informatics tools, and are familiar with medical terminology. Consequently, the medical informatics funding scheme will strengthen data science education for the up-and-coming generation of scientists. In all, medical informatics in Germany is to be positioned as a progressive field in research, education and training  and that entails a focus on the future. As an incentive to create new professorships, BMBF will fund junior research groups at universities that commit to establishing these positions.

Phases










              The medical informatics initiative will unfold in three distinct phases. The first began in 2016, and the last is slated to end in 2026.             




Before the data integration centres can be established, and IT solutions developed, a number of critical questions have to be addressed. Against this background, BMBF initially funded a nine-month conceptual phase. The most attractive concepts were chosen in July 2017 for implementation in the subsequent four-year development and networking phase.
The solutions that proved successful in the developing and networking phase can then be applied on a broader scale, and at other locations, during the consolidation and extension phase. There will also be additional funding modules at the same time as this phase. The  will provide guidance throughout.
Conceptual phase (2016-2017)
A total of seven  were funded during the nine-month conceptual phase. Each comprises multiple university hospitals, plus various partners from higher education and research institutions, non-university hospitals, and healthcare organisations.
The consortia created solutions for shared data use and exchange, worked on concrete applications for data exchange (use cases), and developed plans for data integration centres, to be implemented during the subsequent phase.
All groups are actively involved in cross-consortia collaboration and coordination via the national steering committee, and in various working groups.
Development and networking phase (2018-2022)
In the four-year development and networking phase, the chosen  received funding to implement their solutions.
Each participating university hospital and, where applicable, other partners in the consortia established a data integration centre, and developed their IT solutions for the use cases.
Towards the end of this phase, the consortia were subjected to an external audit. This determined whether the groups had successfully added value for research or patient care, and verified that data exchange was possible between consortia.
The consortia were also expected to recruit additional university hospitals as network partners, paving the way for successful solutions to be shared at a later date.
The aim of consortia activities is to strengthen medical informatics in Germany. As an incentive to create new professorships, BMBF is funding junior research groups at universities that have committed to establishing these positions.
Cooperation between and beyond consortia via the national steering committee, and in working groups for specific topics, has been continued. Guaranteeing the interoperability of the IT systems, and the existence of uniform data security, protection and quality standards is vital.
Consolidation and Extension phase (2023-2026)
Solutions that have proven viable will be made available to additional university hospitals, and potentially to other hospitals and research institutions. To ensure researchers, doctors and, ultimately, patients benefit from these advances as much as possible, further actors will be involved in data exchange. These could include outpatient care and private clinics, for example.

Explore the initiative interactively










              On behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the DLR Project Management Agency (DLR Projekttrger) has developed an interactive map which provides information about the medical informatics initiative.            

The map explains how the initiative aims to concretely improve patient care - from more precise cancer and intensive care medicine to combating hospital infections. It points out which university hospitals, academic partners and companies collaborate in the four consortia throughout Germany.
Via mouse click all locations can be accessed that are dedicated to a specific use case, for example in the field of heart or lung diseases (heart failure, asthma, COPD) or neurological diseases (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's). One click on a map point leads to detailed information on the selected location and its role in the medical informatics initiative.

About the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII):
The aim of the MII is to digitally network routine data from patient care throughout Germany and make it available for medical research in order to be able to treat diseases faster and more effectively in the future. All German university medical centres are working on this together with non-university hospitals, research institutions, companies, health insurance companies and patient representatives in the four consortia DIFUTURE, HiGHmed, MIRACUM and SMITH.
TMF (Technology, Methods and Infrastructure for Networked Medical Research) manages the MII coordination office, which it operates together with the German Association of Medical Faculties (MFT) and the German Association of Academic Medical Centers (VUD).
The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is funding the MII with a total of over 480 million euros up to and including 2026. Data protection and data security are of the highest priority.

Consortia










              The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is to provide funding to several consortia within the scope of its Medical Informatics Initiative (MII). Each consortium comprises multiple university hospitals, plus additional partners such as research and higher education institutions, businesses, and non-university hospitals. The consortia work together to create a cross-organisational basis for the exchange of data from research and patient care.             








The initial focus is on university hospitals, since this is where patient care and clinical research are most closely connected. There are a minimum of two, but typically more, university hospitals in each consortium. Other partners include research organisations, enterprises, universities, and non-university hospitals. Key to the initiative is the establishment and interconnection of  by each consortium. These centres are tasked with creating technical and organisational solutions for the exchange of data between healthcare professionals and clinical/biomedical researchers. Critically, the data are not stored centrally in the centres themselves. Instead, they reside locally at the site where they were captured.The consortia are also developing IT solutions for specific , with the aim of sharing research and clinical data across multiple locations and organisations. Examples of these use cases include IT-based support for diagnosing and treating rare diseases  plus recruiting patients for clinical studies, creating personalised cancer therapies, and similar tasks in day-to-day healthcare and research. These concrete use cases demonstrate the added value of the consortias data-sharing and IT solutions.Furthermore, the consortia are working to strengthen medical informatics in Germany. Measures include the development of curricula, and the establishment of professorships and junior research groups.To this end, initial ideas were developed during the first  (conceptual phase, from 2016 to 2017). The best solutions were selected, and are being implemented (development and networking phase, from 2018 to 2022). The solutions will be made available to other (university) hospitals (consolidation and further development phase, from 2023 to 2026). Consortia coordinate their activities and communicate with other stakeholders via . The goal is to ensure interoperability of the IT solutions. Additionally, the new infrastructures must meet very high standards of quality, data protection and security.

Data integration centres
DIFUTURE data integration centres are modular, extensible, and standards-based. Specifically, data integration encompasses the harmonisation of data and processes, with a focus on ensuring high data quality. In order to guarantee interoperability, DIFUTURE deploys commercially available components with open source software. Privacy and protection play a central role, e.g. via security by design, data minimisation, and layered data security. DIFUTUREs analyses and studies will employ distributed approaches  and will therefore prioritise method transfer rather than data transfer.
Use Cases
Use case 1: multiple sclerosis (MS)
The consortiums doctors and scientists are active in MS research, in basic research, and in national and international groups. Data have already been integrated to enable distributed analyses. A key focus is the identification of markers and algorithms to predict the course of the disease, and allow targeted, personalised treatment from an early stage. The spectrum of integrated data is broad, ranging from clinical and laboratory data on multi-dimensional images to genetic information. It is possible to make use of extensive, largely standardised data collections.
Use case 2: Parkinsons disease (PD)
DIFUTUREs use cases are designed for broad applicability. For example, the integration and analysis methods employed for the MS use case can be transferred to the work on Parkinsons disease. The latter project, too, will entail the harmonisation, quality assurance and integration of diverse types of data. These data can be used for analyses within and beyond the consortium. All DIFUTURE use cases  including for rare illnesses, cancer, stroke, and cardiovascular disease  are aimed at enabling precision medicine. The goal is to significantly improve treatment, (early) diagnoses, prevention and aftercare.
Data use and access concept
Data use is based on Germany-wide agreements for the Medical Informatics Initiative, and on in-depth preliminary work at national and international levels. DIFUTURE will follow the principles of the GO-FAIR initiative  i.e. data findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability. Patient trust, free choice, and personal data sovereignty are central elements. To guarantee very high standards of data protection, the consortium deploys innovative methods, such as distributed computing and machine learning, plus systematic risk analyses.

              Conceptual phase            

During the conceptual phase, DIFUTURE harnessed the expertise of four partners  Technical University of Munich, Ludwig Maximillian University Munich, Eberhard Karl University Tbingen, and University of Augsburg  to improve the use and exchange of data from healthcare and clinical/biomedical research across multiple institutions, and to verify value added. 
To this end, it was vital to develop corresponding organisational and technological solutions. DIFUTURE created concepts for data integration centres (DICs) and for use cases that would demonstrate the tangible value of data exchange. In preparation for the conceptual phase, the consortium defined eight use cases. Disease-focused cases included neurology, cancer and cardiology. A neurology use case will be audited. Furthermore, DIFUTURE will strive to generate synergy across the chosen fields.
The conceptual phase culminated in a funding application for the initiatives development and networking phase. DIFUTURE submitted detailed plans for further evolving the consortium partners relevant infrastructures. This included technological and organisational measures, and actions to strengthen medical informatics.

Data integration centres
The partners collaborate across organisations and institutions in order to establish a network of data integration centres and to expand this network in terms of quality and quantity in the following years. In doing so, they aim to develop innovative and interoperable data integration solutions and methods on the basis of international standards and to prove their benefits for research and health care.
Based on three scientifically challenging clinical use cases in the fields of oncology, cardiology and infection control, the data integration centres will show exemplarily how data, information and knowledge from health care as well as clinical and biomedical research can be connected for the benefit of patients across locations. For the efficient use of data between the facilities, the consortium will focus on open, standardised and interoperable solutions that can be transferred to other clinical use cases and sustainably integrated into the operation of university hospitals. Data protection and data security have top priority.
Use Cases
The oncology use case will address the challenges of incorporating huge data volumes (omics data) from genome sequencing and radiology into clinical practice. A virtual oncology centre will visualise the course of cancer treatment, and serve as a platform for sharing information between hospitals, research institutes, doctors and patients. The virtual centre will play a significant role in identifying similar cancer cases, and enabling tailored, patient-centred care  as demonstrated by examples involving tumours of the pancreas, liver and bile ducts.
In the cardiology use case, data from wearable, implanted and connected medical devices will be transferred to the data centres. New, mobile diagnostic devices will have a major impact on medical practice and research. They capture data from long-term monitoring and measurements, generating highly specific and comprehensive data sets. As a result, high-risk patients could be identified early, hospital stays reduced, and mortality rates lowered.
The infection control use case will develop an automated early-warning and cluster-analysis system to support the algorithmic detection of pathogen clusters in hospitals. This includes the identification of multidrug-resistant organism clusters, and their transmission routes within and between hospitals. It will also help determine whether clusters represent genuine outbreaks, and identify potential causes.
Data use and access concept
HiGHmed is developing a comprehensive data protection concept. This takes into account the location-specific principles and policies of the data integration centres, plus the requirements of its three use cases. The consortium has also drawn on the generic data protection concepts published by TMF as part of its book series in 2014.the conceptual phase of the Medical Informatics Initiative to determine details of its data protection concept  for example, on data flow, identifying applicable legislation, origin and determination of data, and on applying technical and organisational solutions. HiGHmed continues to evolve and adapt its data protection concept, taking into account German legislation that has yet to be amended in line with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Presentation and discussion will be via TMFs data protection working.

              Conceptual phase            

The goal of the HiGHmed (Heidelberg - Gttingen - Hanover Medical Informatics) consortium is to develop and apply innovative information infrastructures  to enhance the efficiency of clinical research, and to accelerate the translation of these results into verifiable improvements in patient care.
During the conceptual phase of the initiative, HiGHmed developed concepts to establish four coordinated data integration centres (DICs) at the consortiums locations. These would be compatible across organisations and institutions, and suitable for international cooperation. Moreover, the DICs are to be expanded both qualitatively and quantitatively in the following years.
This work is aligned with HiGHmeds goal of developing innovative, internationally interoperable data integration solutions and methods, and proving their added value for research and patient care. In addition, the consortium intends to establish a programme to strengthen education and promote young medical informatics professionals  with a focus on new learning methods that incorporate digital media.
Concepts ready for implementation were developed in five work packages (WPs):
WP1 defined how data integration centres would be implemented and interconnected in greater detail. 
WP2 formulated research strategies on the basis of three medical use cases. These were developed in detail with corresponding experts from the consortiums three sites to improve the chances of future validation of the data integration centres. The oncology use case focuses on the incorporation of omics data into clinical practice. The cardiology use case is based on data from wearable or implantable sensors, and the infectiology use case on data from healthcare.
WP3 described the education/support programme for young professionals in medical informatics.
WP4 focused on data protection, ethics and legal issues.
In addition to coordinating HiGHmed, WP5 developed concepts for external communications and roll-out.

              MIRACUM Consortium: Medical Informatics for Research and Care in University Medicine

MIRACUM unites ten university hospitals, two universities, and a partner from the healthcare industry, from seven German states. Its goal is to make clinical, image and molecular/genomic data available for use in innovative research projects  both within and across multiple institutions, via modular, scalable and federated data integration centres (DICs). These DICs provide an opportunity to conduct feasibility and observation studies, and evaluate real-world pathways on a large scale. MIRACUM will also support the recruitment of patients for clinical studies, the development of predictive models, and precision medicine. In an effort to strengthen biomedical informatics and medical data science, ten new professorships have already been advertised at the MIRACUM sites, with additional positions to follow. It will also set up a joint, multi-site masters programme on biomedical informatics and medical data science.
MIRACUM is funded by BMBF during the development and networking phase since January 2018.

Data integration centres
The establishment of data integration centres and their federated use is based on MIRACOLIX: an ecosystem of modular and reusable open-source tools. Over the coming years, these tools will be designed, developed and modified step-by-step in line with MIRACUM requirements. They will then be integrated into the infrastructure of the consortiums eight data integration centres.
Data flows, beginning with routine systems in healthcare, are established in strict accordance with recommendations from TMFs generic data protection concept, and with patient consent. They populate research repositories with data types that lend themselves to a variety of analysis methods.
The use and analysis of data across multiple sites is based on federated and decentralised data storage  as well as the philosophy of bringing the analysis to the data.
Use Cases
IT support for patient recruitment: Many clinical studies fall at the first hurdle because they lack enough participants. To improve the recruitment process using IT and available routine data, MIRACUM will integrate corresponding platforms into the healthcare information system (HIS) infrastructure at each of its university hospitals. Regular evaluation and feedback loops help increase the quality and completeness of the corresponding data.
From data to knowledge  clinico-molecular predictive knowledge tool: MIRACUM data integration centres enable the identification and stratification of patient cohorts based on clinical parameters, biomarkers and molecular/genomic data  with the goal of developing predictive models. Smart, FHIR-based apps integrated into healthcare information system (HIS) environments help put these models into practice, and support doctors with diagnostics and treatment decision-making. The initial focus will be on lung diseases and brain tumours.
From knowledge to action  support for molecular tumour boards: In the context of tumours, precision medicine is already very advanced. Many tumours can now be identified by driver mutations, and therefore treated in a targeted way. Moreover, clinical information, images, and molecular/genetic test results are compiled and shared via molecular tumour board meetings to aid interdisciplinary decision-making. MIRACUM will develop innovative IT solutions to improve quality assurance, data processing, data integration and information research that is required between high-throughput genetic analyses and treatment decisions. Additionally, hospitals will benefit from efficient data-visualisation tools that help them choose the right therapies.
Data use and access concept
During the conceptual phase, representatives of the MIRACUM consortium played an active role in the working groups established by the Medical Informatics Initiatives National Steering Committee (NSG). The aim is to ensure all forms of data use are based closely on centrally defined recommendations and interoperability standards. Bearing this in mind, MIRACUM has established eight data-use and -approval committees, and related policies. The first clinical questions and use requests (including cross-consortia analysis within the scope of the NSG's demonstrator study) have already been evaluated and approved. This has enabled corresponding federated analyses to be conducted. MIRACUM has already published its first papers using these results.
Measures to strengthen medical informatics in Germany
Establishment of a multi-site masters programme in biomedical informatics and medical data science designed for individuals already employed in related fields; part time as a non-consecutive masters programme. The degree qualifies graduates for scientific research and leadership roles in the healthcare sector
Joint PhD programme in biomedical informatics and medical data science; for professionals in medicine, biomedical informatics, natural sciences, and biomedical technology
Training programme/online exercises in medical data science for doctors and medical researchers
Special summer schools for MIRACUM members, and for interested members of other consortia
Training programme for MIRACUM members, including regular webinars, online exercises and the opportunity to be an observer at other MIRACUM sites

              Conceptual phase            

The MIRACUM consortium created detailed concepts for the establishment of data integration centres, for cross-institutional data use, for the development of modules to support use cases, for the evaluation of use cases, and for strengthening medical informatics in research and education.
For long-term success of the project as a whole, ongoing support for young professionals is vital. Consequently, MIRACUM developed a training/skills development programme for medical informatics, with a focus on data science in medicine. The goal was the creation of a comprehensive project plan that takes into account the current situation at each of the eight sites, and the latest international developments.
To gain visibility into the global state of the art, MIRACUM members travelled the USA on a fact-finding trip, and visited facilities with proven excellence in data sharing/integration.
The consortium performed tasks in three working groups: data integration centres, use cases, and strengthening medical informatics. The corresponding work was finalised at a steering board workshop at the end of the conceptual phase.

              Development and networking phase            

In the SMITH medical informatics consortium, more than 300 clinical, epidemiological and systems medicine employees are working to link research and healthcare systematically for the first time. For this purpose, the data generated daily in routine care are processed with the patients' consent and made available to medical research in a standardized form. This enables researchers to better understand and analyse healthcare processes. Patients benefit from reliable research results, more precise diagnoses and better treatments.The prerequisites for linking healthcare data with research data are new technical interfaces between healthcare and biomedical research at clinical sites. To this end, the 19 consortium partners are jointly establishing a data architecture that enables interoperable data use from patient care and research across the boundaries of institutions and sites. Within this framework, the university hospitals participating in the consortium have established sustainable data integration centers (DIC) in Aachen, Bonn, Essen, Halle, Hamburg, Jena and Leipzig. The network partners Ruhr University Bochum, the Dsseldorf University Hospital and the University Medical Center Rostock are preparing to establish a DIC.The consortium demonstrates the functionality and added value of intelligent and responsible data use through one methodological use case and two clinical use cases in the areas of intensive care and infectious medicine.SMITH is one of four consortia of the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and is supported by the BMBF in the development and networking phase from 2018 to 2022.SMITH at a glance:1 methodical use case to support clinical evaluation projects2 clinical use cases for targeted care in intensive and infectious medicine19 partners from science and industryPartners include 9 German university hospitals, 4 Universities, 4 industrial partners and 2 non-university research institutionsOver 300 project membersApprox. EUR 55 million total funding volume (2018  2022)Data integration centresSeven of the ten university medical sites participating in the consortium have established a Data Integration Center (DIC) so far, and three network partners are preparing the structure. The centers enable the cross-institutional and cross-site use of digital health data from patient care and biomedical research.The DIC act as intermediaries in advising on the use of data, organizing corresponding projects and facilitating the provision of data. To this end, they establish interoperable directories with quality-assured, internationally harmonized data and metadata. These are made available anonymously via trustees. Data protection and data security have the highest priority.The Data Integration Centers are established with identical functionality. All centers are embedded at university medical sites with access to patient data. Within the scope of their work with clinical and research data, the DIC contribute to the establishment of a research-compatible electronic patient record for the German health care system.The added value of this data use is demonstrated by the consortium in one methodological and two clinical use cases.Use casesMethodological Use Case: PheP  Phenotyping Pipeline supporting Clinical Evaluation ProjectsIn the methodological Use Case Phenotyping Pipeline, PheP for short, SMITH develops innovative data analytical methods that automatically extract medical information from electronic patient records. Evaluation projects and calculations on existing data lead to ever new patient-related information and to a differentiated characterization of human attributes, so-called phenotypes. The rich data pool enables long-term optimization of clinical research and patient care.SMITH demonstrates the procedure in two clinical use cases.Clinical Use Case 1: ASIC - Algorithmic Surveillance in Intensive CareWith the ASIC Use Case, the consortium promotes the improvement of patient care by using already existing clinical routine data. This will be shown using the example of the therapy of patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a disease from which about 40 percent of all affected patients still die today. The ASIC App developed for this purpose functions as an early warning system by alerting doctors to potential ARDS before the patient's condition threatens to become critical.Clinical Use Case 2: HELP  Guideline-based Use of Antibiotics in Infectious MedicineThe HELP Use Case focuses on the guideline-based and recommended use of antibiotics for early and targeted control of certain bacterial infections. The main focus lies on the support of infectiology in normal and intensive care units using the HELP App developed for this purpose. This provides medical staff with rapid information and recommendations for responsible antibiotic therapy in staphylococcal bloodstream infections.Data usage conceptData is used locally via the Data Integration Centers (DIC), which have access to the Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and thus to the use of patient data. The patient data is individually analyzed and commented on in the hospital. This data can only be accessed by authorized employees of the Data Integration Centers via the locally operating HIS system. Research into patient data is only possible with the patient's consent. In this respect, the Data Integration Centers set up an independent trustee office.Measures to strengthen medical informaticsConception of coordinated, joint training, advanced training and continuing education modulesOffers for curricula in the area of "Master of Science" (M.Sc.) medical informatics and in the postgraduate areaEstablishment of a professorship for Medical Informatics at the University Hospital BonnEstablishment of a professorship for Data Science at the Essen University HospitalEstablishment of a professorship for Biomedical Data Science at the University Hospital HalleEstablishment of a professorship for Applied Medical Informatics at the University Medical Center Hamburg-EppendorfEstablishment of a professorship for Medical Informatics at the Jena University HospitalEstablishment of a professorship for Medical Data Science at the Leipzig UniversityEstablishment of junior research groups in connection with the establishment of professorshipsConcept phaseThe aim of the SMITH Consortium is to develop an innovative structure for cross-institutional networking and the exchange of research and care data between the funded sites and beyond the consortium.The project proposal envisages that cooperating generic Data Integration Centers (DIC) will be established at the locations. The DICs will ensure the transfer of data from primary systems and the consolidation and preparation of data. A further task is to ensure data protection and data quality.For the practical demonstration of the data exchange, methodological and clinical use cases have been conceptually developed to prove the effectiveness of the Data Integration Centers. Thus, a concept for a methodical Phenotyping Platform was developed, whose task is to build a new data set for specific human attributes, so-called phenotypes, from patient-related information. This rich data set will enable the support of clinical evaluation projects and in the long run a patient-centered care. In addition, the concept development for clinical use cases in the fields of intensive care and infectious medicine was performed.In addition, a joint training, further education and continuing education module was designed for the locations, which offers similar and modular curricula in the "Master of Science" medical informatics area and in the postgraduate area. The project proposal was approved by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in July 2017. Since 2018, the SMITH-Consortium is in the building and networking phase.

              Conceptual phase            

The aim of the SMITH Consortium is to develop an innovative structure for cross-institutional networking and the exchange of research and care data between the funded sites and beyond the consortium.The project proposal envisages that cooperating generic Data Integration Centers (DIC) will be established at the locations. The DICs will ensure the transfer of data from primary systems and the consolidation and preparation of data. A further task is to ensure data protection and data quality.For the practical demonstration of the data exchange, methodological and clinical use cases have been conceptually developed to prove the effectiveness of the Data Integration Centers. Thus, a concept for a methodical Phenotyping Platform was developed, whose task is to build a new data set for specific human attributes, so-called phenotypes, from patient-related information. This rich data set will enable the support of clinical evaluation projects and in the long run a patient-centered care. In addition, the concept development for clinical use cases in the fields of intensive care and infectious medicine was performed.In addition, a joint training, further education and continuing education module was designed for the locations, which offers similar and modular curricula in the "Master of Science" medical informatics area and in the postgraduate area. The project proposal was approved by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in July 2017. Since 2018, the SMITH-Consortium is in the building and networking phase.

Data integration centres










              The consortia of the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) have established data integration centres (DIC) at their university medical sites. In these new facilities, data from healthcare and research of a university hospital are collected, whereby data quality and data protection are essential.            




The DIC is usually an institution within the hospital and is generally closely linked to the clinical IT units, thus ensuring a close connection to the systems of patient care. The tasks of the DIC include the transfer of data from a wide range of data-providing systems, the integration and processing of this data, and ensuring data quality and data protection. The processed data is then made available for use in medical research and research results are fed back into the health care system via the DIC.The DIC thus create the technical and organisational prerequisites for data use processes between patient care and medical research across multiple sites. The DIC thus enable medical data to be recorded, integrated and exchanged in such a way that they can be used effectively in health care and research - even repeatedly. Standardisation, reusability and interoperability of data are key factors here. In the future, researchers should be able to use harmonised data from all German university hospitals with a single query within a uniform legal framework. The DIC will be maintained as a permanent, sustainable infrastructure, thus improving digital, targeted health care and preparing the federal research system for the future.Locations of the data integration centres of the Medical Informatics Initiative:DIFUTUREUniversity Hospital Augsburg (UKA) Technical University of Munich (TUM)/University Hospital rechts der Isar (MRI)Hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) Munich University Hospital Regensburg (UKR) Saarland University/Saarland University Medical Center (UKS)University Hospital Tbingen (EKUT) Ulm University Medical Center (UKU)HiGHmedCharit - Universittsmedizin Berlin Carl-Thiem-Klinikum Cottbus gGmbHUniversity Medical Center GttingenHannover Medical SchoolHeidelberg University Hospital and the Medical Faculty of HeidelbergUniversity Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH) University Hospital Cologne (UKK) University of MnsterUniversity Hospital of Wrzburg/Julius-Maximilians-Universitt (JMU) MIRACUMKlinikum ChemnitzTU Dresden/University Hospital DresdenFriedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg/University Hospital Erlangen Goethe University Frankfurt/Main/University Hospital FrankfurtUniversity of Freiburg/Medical Center  University of Freiburg Justus Liebig University Giessen/University Hospital Giessen/MarburgGreifswald University Hospital Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg/University Hospital MagdeburgUniversity Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University MainzMedical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University/University Medical Centre Mannheim Philipps-Universitt Marburg/University Hospital Giessen/Marburg SMITHUniklinik RWTH AachenUniversity Hospital BonnEssen University Hospital University Hospital Halle (Saale)University Medical Center Hamburg-EppendorfUniversity Hospital JenaLeipzig University Medical Center

Use Cases and Projects










Consolidation and extension phase
Use cases of the MII
In January 2023, the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) entered the consolidation and extension phase to further advance digitalisation in health research. In the new funding phase, the cooperation between the university hospitals is to be expanded and extended to include new partners, especially from regional care.
So-called data integration centres (DICs) have been established at the university medical sites throughout Germany. In these centres, health care data are to be made available for medical research in accordance with data protection regulations. The functionality of the DICs is now being tested and further developed in new clinical use cases of the MII.
Structural projects of the MII
In addition, eight MII projects are being funded. They pursue the purpose of advancing the harmonisation of health data and IT solutions at the university hospital sites in cooperation with the "Network of University Medicine" (NUM).
Digital Hubs: Advances in Research and Health Care







In addition, the BMBF is funding six Digital Hubs within the framework of the MII with around 50 million euros (2021-2025). Their task is to integrate the pioneering work of the MII into further areas of the health system: from outpatient care in GP practices to healthcare in rehabilitation and nursing facilities.




Development and networking phase
Use cases of the consortia
In the development and networking phase (2018-2022), the consortia of the Medical Informatics Initiative have developed IT solutions for concrete use cases  to demonstrate the possibilities offered by advanced digital services and infrastructures in healthcare. The use cases address either clinical or infrastructural/methodological topics.
Cross-consortia collaborative projects
In addition, numerous German university hospitals and partner institutions were involved across consortia in the following collaborative projects within the framework of the Medical Informatics Initiative:

Use Cases (Consolidation and extension phase)










              In the data integration centres (DIC) of the MII, health care data are to be made available for medical research in a data protection-compliant manner. During the consolidation and extension phase, the functionality of the DIC will be tested and further developed in new use cases of the MII. Eight clinical use cases and three methodology platforms are being funded.            

Clinical Use Cases
ACRIBiS


For the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, physicians use so-called risk scores for the individual risk assessment of patients. In the project, routine cardiological clinical documentation shall be structured and standardized across sites. In addition, the infrastructure for automated analysis of biosignal data, such as the ECG, is to be expanded and integrated into the DIC infrastructure at the clinics. These data sources shall be used to improve risk models that can predict the development and course of cardiovascular diseases and thus support better treatment in the future.








CALM-QE


In order to better diagnose and individually treat patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the factors influencing the clinical pictures and their interactions should be better understood. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will be used to develop multidimensional models to predict the risk for important clinical outcome parameters.







EyeMatics


The project aims to make clinical data from patients with common eye diseases receiving IVOM (intravitreal drug administration) therapy available for scientific evaluation to improve treatment outcomes. Intravitreal injection involves administering a drug directly into the vitreous humor of the eye. This is intended to preserve or improve vision. An analysis platform will be provided for EyeMatics to integrate data from various inpatient and outpatient care systems.








INTERPOLAR


When patients use many different medications, drug interactions can occur. The aim of INTERPOLAR is to detect these automatically in order to prevent adverse effects. To achieve this, patients with a particularly high risk of medication errors and side effects are identified. In this way, the limited resources of ward pharmacists can be directed to the high-risk patients in order to achieve maximum patient benefit.








PCOR-MII


The project will help to ensure that the subjective health status of patients ("Patient Reported Outcome") can be easily measured in all German university hospitals with the help of questionnaires and evaluated together with outcome-relevant clinical parameters. The benefit of this systematic recording will be investigated on the basis of three clinical examples: Patients with anorexia nervosa, with permanent physical complaints and after kidney transplantation.








PMOnco


The project aims to create a permanent infrastructure to integrate and exchange data from clinical and biomedical research. This is to lay the foundation for establishing personalized medicine in cancer treatment.








RISK PRINCIPE


The goal is to develop and implement a data-driven, risk-stratified infection control system to most effectively and efficiently reduce the number of bacteremias (presence of bacteria in the bloodstream) occurring in the hospital. To this end, an automated surveillance system will be established and validated.







Somnolink


If breathing pauses (apneas) occur during sleep more than five times an hour, this is known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Somnolink aims to optimise patient-centered diagnosis and treatment of OSA. In particular, it aims to improve the detection of OSA among female patients. In addition, decision support systems using artificial intelligence shall provide a better understanding of the individual causes of OSA, the associated health risks and the most suitable therapy.







Methodenplattformen
GeMTeX


The project aims to make medical texts from patient care available for research in anonymised form. To this end, a large annotated text collection of German medical texts from the daily patient care is to be created.








PrivateAIM


The goal is to develop a federated platform for privacy-compliant machine learning and data analytics for MII. In doing so, the analyses should come to the data and not the data to the analyses.








OMI


The methodology platform for "Open Medical Inference" (OMI) aims to simplify the use of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in order to perform time-consuming and repetitive tasks in medicine using AI methods in the future. In order to relieve clinics with regard to the maintenance, provision and operation of diverse AI models, the OMI project is establishing a network of users and providers of AI models who offer their models as "turnkey" services.

Structural projects of the MII










              In Module 2b of the consolidation and extension phase of the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII), eight projects (baseTraCE, DSF, EVA4MII, FDPG-PLUS, fit4translation, MII_NUM, SU-TermServ and TRANSIT) are being funded as overarching measures of the MII. They pursue the purpose of advancing the harmonisation of health data and IT solutions at the university hospital sites in cooperation with the "Network of University Medicine" (NUM).            

baseTraCE - Basic services for the training andfurther education within the MllThe baseTraCe project serves as a central hub for the MII's further education and training measures. A sustainable and flexible platform is intended to ensure that the education-related developments and information structures created within the consortia are maintained and made available to the entire MII community.start of project: 01/07/2023


DSF - Data Sharing Framework CommunityThe DSF network coordinates the digital exchange of research data from various partners in medicine. To this end, communication processes are to be harmonised across all locations, making data exchange easier. In addition, the networking of all the expertise in the medical informatics initiative should be promoted.start of project: 01/01/2023


EVA4MII  Evaluation research on the basis ofdata from routine clinical careThe EVA4MII project is dedicated to establishing an infrastructure to support evaluation research based on clinical data that is routinely collected within the MII. To this end, the network is developing a consulting service (EVA4MII platform) that supports researchers in the development and implementation of research projects. The focus is on advising MII projects. However, new user groups are also to be supported, for example projects of the GB-A Innovation Fund or the Health Technology Assessment of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG).start of project: 01/04/2023


FDPG plus - Extension of the MII's German Portal forMedical Research DataThe FDPG plus project serves the further development, continuous improvement and robust provision of the central MII German Portal forMedical Research Data (FDPG). The gradually growing functionalities of the FDPG are to be defined, prioritised and implemented on the basis of new requirements from the public, patients, new clinical use cases and the MII working groups.start of project: 01/01/2023


fit4translation - Enhancing expertise and supportin the development of medical software under theregulatory framework of the MDR and IVDR in theacademic environmentClinical decision support systems or other systems, that use artificial intelligence to process medical data for better treatment or targeted detection of diseases, can only be used in everyday practice, if they fulfil certain safety requirements. This is regulated, for example, by the European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) or the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR). The fit4translation project aims to raise researchers' awareness of these regulatory aspects. The network develops cross-MII teaching materials, organises workshops and seminars and advises research projects on the implementation of regulatory requirements.start of project: 01/07/2023


MII_NUM  Cooperation between MII and NUMThe MII-NUM project is entirely dedicated to strengthening and expanding cooperation between the MII and the Network of University Medicine (NUM). Its objectives include the establishment of joint training measures in the areas of IT security and consent management as well as the increased involvement of the NUM clinical community in the work within the MII. In particular, this also includes the joint use and further development of mutually funded infrastructures as well as the establishment of overarching working groups between MII and NUM. Another core task of the project is to establish cooperation and convergence between MII and NUM at the governance level.start of project: 01/01/2023


SU-TermServ  Service Unit 'Terminological Services'for MII and NUMThe SU-TermServ project aims to further develop and research a central terminology server and supplementary IT solutions. The aim is to (further) develop, test and establish an important element for extended data exchange and the joint re-utilisation of health-related data across institutional and consortium boundaries. The expanded structures are to be used as a service unit for medical research and to improve patient care and quality management.start of project: 01/01/2023


TRANSIT  Data Management UnitThe TRANSIT project is dedicated to the sustainable consolidation and integration of centralised and decentralised infrastructure components of the MII for the purpose of data exchange and data provision in the context of secondary data usage projects. For this purpose, the network is developing a Data Management Unit (DMU), which bundles activities and functionalities for the provision and archiving of data sets and results from federated data analyses as a central system with a standardised user interface. The DMU provides essential services for scientists in their role as data consumers.start of project: 01/01/2023

"Digital Hubs: Advances in Research and Health Care










              Enhance regional care and strengthen data-driven research            




Using data helps to treat diseases. Not only at university clinics, but also in general practitioners' practices, hospitals, care and rehabilitation facilities, digital innovations are to help improve health care in the future. The University Medicine has done important pioneering work throughout Germany in the Medical Informatics Initiative funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Since mid-2021, the "Digital Hubs: Advances in Research and Health Care, also funded by the BMBF, will take the next step: they will develop exemplary solutions to transfer digital innovations into regional care and optimise them in practice. In addition, regional health care data will in future also help research to improve health care concepts and therapies in a targeted way, while respecting data privacy. The BMBF is funding the Digital Hubs with 50 million euros from 2021 to 2025.
Focus on innovations that benefit people in many ways
In 2021, Federal Minister of Research Anja Karliczek explained: "The 'Digital Hubs: Advances in Research and Health Care' will demonstrate the benefits of digitalisation in medicine in concrete use cases that will benefit many people - especially in rural regions. For example, several Digital Hubs are dedicated to the field of cancer medicine and support the goals of the National Decade against Cancer, which was launched by the BMBF in 2019. Pandemic management also lies within the topic spectrum of the Digital Hubs. The solutions developed and tested here should help the health care system to be even better equipped against future crises." (Editor's note: Original quote in German.)

How Digital Hubs work



Data from different sources - university hospitals, clinics, outpatient providers and rehabilitation facilities - will support health research to develop better therapies and follow-up care concepts. Copyright: DLR Projekttrger/BMBFThe starting point of a Hub is the data integration centre of a university hospital. These centres are currently being established as IT infrastructures at almost all university hospitals as part of the Medical Informatics Initiative. The data integration centres network with regional partners - including hospitals, doctors' practices, rehabilitation and care facilities as well as emergency services. Research institutions and health insurance companies are also partners of the Hubs. They all share and use their data together. Science, IT, care providers, doctors, nursing staff and patients work closely together.
Objectives and main focus of the Digital Hubs

Use Cases of the Consortia










              The consortia of the Medical Informatics Initiative have developed IT solutions for concrete use cases during development and networking phase (2018-2022)  to demonstrate the possibilities offered by advanced digital services and infrastructures in healthcare. The use cases address either clinical or infrastructural/methodological topics.            

Clinical use cases
Multiple sclerosis


The  consortiums doctors and scientists are active in multiple sclerosis (MS) research. The scope of data that have already been integrated is broad, ranging from clinical and laboratory data, to multi-dimensional images, to genetic information. Furthermore, there are extensive, largely standardised data collections available. Distributed analyses will be conducted with the aim, in particular, of identifying markers and algorithms to predict disease progression  and to allow targeted, personalised treatment from an early stage.







Parkinsons disease
For the Parkinsons disease (PD) use case, the  consortium will build upon the integration and analysis methods employed for the MS use case. The PD project, too, will entail the harmonisation of diverse types of data  and their integration in conjunction with robust quality control, making them available for analysis. This use case and others  including for rare illnesses, cancer, stroke, and cardiovascular disease  are aimed at enabling precision medicine. The goal is to significantly improve treatment, (early) diagnosis, prevention and aftercare.
Oncology


In the oncology use case, the  consortium will address the challenges associated with incorporating huge data volumes from genome sequencing (omics data) and radiology into clinical practice. A virtual oncology centre will visualise cancer treatment, and serve as a platform for sharing information between hospitals, research institutions, doctors and patients. The virtual centre will play a significant role in identifying cancer cases of similar kinds, and enabling tailored, patient-centred care  as demonstrated by examples involving tumours of the pancreas, liver and bile ducts.




Cardiology


In the cardiology use case, the consortium will import data from wearable, implanted or connected medical devices to the IT architecture of the data integration centres. New, mobile diagnostic devices will have a major impact on medical practice and research. They capture data from long-term monitoring and measurements, generating highly specific and comprehensive data sets. As a result, high-risk patients could be identified early, hospital stays reduced, and mortality rates lowered.




Infection control


In its infection control use case, the  consortium will develop an automated early-warning and cluster-analysis system to support the algorithmic detection of pathogen clusters in hospitals. This includes the identification of multidrug-resistant pathogen clusters, and their transmission routes within and between hospitals. It will also help determine whether clusters represent genuine outbreaks, and identify potential causes of outbreaks and transmission.




ASIC - Algorithmic Surveillance in Intensive Care


With the ASIC use case, the  consortium promotes the improvement of patient care by using already existing clinical routine data. This will be shown using the example of the therapy of patients with acute lung failure (ARDS), a disease from which about 40 percent of all affected patients still die today. The ASIC app developed for this purpose functions as an early warning system by alerting doctors to potential ARDS before the patient's condition threatens to become critical.




HELP - Guideline-based Use of Antibiotics in Infectious Medicine


With the HELP use case, the  consortium focuses on the guideline-based and recommended use of antibiotics for early and targeted control of certain bacterial infections. The main focus lies on the support of infectiology in normal and intensive care units using the HELP app developed for this purpose. This provides medical staff with rapid information and recommendations for responsible antibiotic therapy in staphylococcal bloodstream infections.




Infrastructural and methodological use cases 
Patient recruitment for clinical studies
Many clinical studies fall at the first hurdle because they lack a sufficient number of participants. To improve the recruitment process using IT and available routine data, the  consortium will  in the use case Alerting in care  IT support for patient recruitment  integrate corresponding platforms into the healthcare information system (HIS) infrastructure at each of its university hospitals. Regular evaluation and feedback loops will help continuously improve the quality of documentation and ensure the completeness of data elements used for recruitment.
Predictive models for clinical decision-making
The gradual expansion of MII data integration centres lays the foundations for identifying and stratifying patient cohorts into subgroups based on clinical parameters, biomarkers and molecular/genomic data  with the goal of developing subgroup-specific predictive models. In the use case From data to knowledge  clinico-molecular predictive knowledge tool, the  consortium will integrate smart, FHIR-based apps into healthcare information system (HIS) environments. This will help put these predictive models into practice, and support doctors with diagnostics and treatment decision-making. The initial clinical focus will be on lung diseases and brain tumours.
Data visualisation for the support of treatment decision-making
In the context of tumours, precision medicine is already very advanced. Many tumours can now be identified by driver mutations, and therefore treated in a targeted way. Moreover, clinical information, images, and molecular/genetic test results are combined and shared via molecular tumour boards (MTB) to aid interdisciplinary decision-making. In this context, the consortium will develop innovative IT solutions to improve the complex processes associated with quality assurance, data processing, data integration and information research that take place between high-throughput genetic analyses and treatment decision-making. Additionally, hospitals will benefit from efficient data-visualisation tools that help them choose the right therapies.
PheP  Phenotyping pipeline supporting clinical evaluation projects
In the methodological use case Phenotyping Pipeline, PheP for short,  develops innovative data analytical methods that automatically extract medical information from electronic patient records. Evaluation projects and calculations on existing data lead to ever new patient-related information and to a differentiated characterization of human attributes, so-called phenotypes. The rich data pool enables long-term optimization of clinical research and patient care.

Collaboration










              The Medical Informatics Initiative encompasses multiple regions in Germany. Participating institutes and groups must coordinate their activities, and interact with diverse stakeholders. Various committees have been established to organise structured dialogue and collaboration.            




Project structure of the Medical Informatics InitiativeThe central vision of the initiative is the development and deployment of IT solutions to strengthen research and enhance patient care in university hospitals.
The goal is to ensure that locally developed IT solutions are interoperable with other systems. Furthermore, the new infrastructures must meet very high standards of quality, data protection and security. It is especially important to understand the aims, requirements, and concerns of diverse stakeholders  including scientists, doctors, patients, representatives of regulatory bodies, and many others  and to incorporate these insights into the initiative.
The core tasks of the medical informatics initiative will be carried out primarily by the university hospitals. Each  comprises a minimum of two university hospitals, plus various partners. In addition, the funding scheme allows additional organisations to  at a later stage.
All consortia are represented in the corresponding , with the aim of aligning activities and agreeing parameters and to avoid siloed solutions and make significant headway at a national level.
These shared parameters are developed and discussed in dedicated working groups: , ,  and .
Additionally, the  allows representatives from the various groups to exchange ideas and information. Participants include patient advocacy groups, policy makers, government agencies, research centres and other scientific institutions, associations, and healthcare IT industry organisations. The forum ensures that strategic planning is discussed, agreed and supported by all stakeholders.
The members of the advise the National Steering Committee on overarching topics that either have an impact on the Medical Informatics Initiative as a whole or the external framework of reference.
Collaboration between and beyond consortia is supported by a coordination office jointly managed by ,  (Medizinischer Fakulttentag  German Association of Medical Faculties), and  (Verband der Universtittsklinika Deutschlands German Association of Academic Medical Centers).

National Steering Committee










              All consortia are represented in the corresponding National Steering Committee, with the aim of aligning activities and agreeing parameters. Concept papers, defined requirements, and template texts will be jointly prepared and discussed in dedicated working groups, and consented by the National Steering Committee.


Representatives of all funded consortia meet regularly within the national steering committee (NSC) of the medical informatics initiative in order to coordinate activities and agree key parameters. The NSC is a platform that enables the requirements of the scientific and research community to be consolidated, discussed and jointly acted upon. Members are also multipliers, communicating NSC decisions to the consortia and supporting implementation.

Coordination Office










              The coordination office, jointly managed by TMF (Technology, Methods and Infrastructure for Networked Medical Research), MFT (German Association of Medical Faculties), and VUD (German Association of Academic Medical Centers), promotes cross-consortia collaboration.


The office is in Berlin, making use of the facilities of TMF. The support structure teams work and meetings are held in TMFs rooms. This facilitates close cooperation and coordination with the working groups, projects and strategic activities of TMF as the umbrella organisation for medical IT infrastructure and research data management.
The medical informatics initiative is jointly managed by the Executive Director of TMF, and the managing directors of MFT and VUD. MFT and VUD use their own resources to finance and enable their activities within the initiative (and receive no dedicated funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF). The directors jointly oversee the national steering committee (NSC), and discuss the strategic development of the initiative amongst themselves and with the ministry. Together, they have a single vote on the NSC.
Tasks
Supporting the work of the national steering committee and chairing NSC meetings
Making available their expertise in infrastructure implementation and medicine; development of concepts and papers
Organisation of and participation in all medical informatics initiative meetings, including drawing up an agenda, recoding minutes, and follow-up activities

Consent working group










              The consent working group focuses on the design of the consent declaration signed by patients to allow healthcare data to be used in future medical research.             

Goals and tasksA key objective of the Medical Informatics Initiative is to ensure routinely captured patient data are available for research and to improve medical care. Scientific use is only permissible where the patient has given their explicit consent. In particular, the structure and wording of patient information and any declaration of consent must take into account that the concrete purpose of future research is not known at the time the data are captured.The consent working group is currently identifying the legal parameters for the design of corresponding information and consent forms, and is developing solutions and template documents for discussion and agreement amongst project participants and relevant stakeholders.ResultsStandardised template document, comprising preamble, declaration of consent and patient information; preliminary work performed by the working group and finalisation by the writing groupWorking group chairpersons:Dr Sven Zenker (University Hospital Bonn)Gabriele Mller (Technische Universitt Dresden)

Data sharing working group










              The data sharing working group is developing a legally robust framework for data access and usage within the scope of the Medical Informatics Initiative.            

Goals and tasks
A central goal of the previous development and networking phase of the Medical Informatics Initiative was to define a standardised framework for data access and usage across all of Germany. In order to implement this goal, the Data Sharing Working Group (WG) developed legally secured framework conditions and corresponding contracts for data access and data usage. In addition, the prerequisites for cross-site queries were developed and created, and the specification of cross-consortium use cases was defined. In addition, audit criteria were developed to serve as evidence of functioning data exchange. In the Use & Access Task Force, the tasks and processes of data use were defined in a uniform and binding manner in the MII's use regulations.
In the current consolidation and extension phase, a central task of the Data Sharing WG is to further develop the governance of data use within the MII. Consideration must be given to expansion to new, additional institutions and support for new scenarios and data types. The coordination office is responsible for coordinating the content of the work together with the representatives of the consortia. Individual tasks are taken over by task forces, which also require central coordination. Certain tasks, in particular the examination of legal issues in the further development of contractual bases, will also be taken over by the coordination office.
Activities
The Data Sharing Working Group coordinates its activities in meetings and web conferences. Within the Data Sharing WG, the following task forces have been established:
Audit Preparation Task Force
Data Protection Task Force
Use & Access Task Force
Distributed Analyses Task Force

External data working group










              The External Data Working Group (WG) establishes the administrative and organizational framework for incorporating and linking data from external sources such as health insurance companies, registries, and other data-centric initiatives.            

Goals and Tasks
Beginning with the Broad Consent's "Health Insurance Data" module, the focus will be on performance data from the statutory health insurance system, which will enable a longitudinal view of patients' use of health care (patient journey) in outpatient care (prescription data, procedures), inpatient care, and rehabilitation.
The WG will be the MII's point of contact with other data holders. In addition, the WG will design solutions for the scientific use of health insurance data in clinical and health services research. To achieve its goals, the WG will work closely with existing working groups of the German Network of University Medicine (NUM), the German Network Health Service Research (DNVF), and the German Society for Epidemiology (AGENS group).
The External Data WG is jointly coordinated by the Medical Informatics Initiative and the Network of University Medicine.

The Medical Informatics Initiative is a complex project involving diverse actors and target groups. The communication working group is tasked with developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy for effective communication across the initiative. The aim is to define consistent core messages, and to establish communication activities for various target groups. In addition, the working group is creating umbrella branding, and coordinates communication channels within MII.

DIC Management Forum










The operational management of the existing  or those currently being set up are represented in the DIC Management Forum. This includes 40 DIC locations.One of the forum's tasks is to coordinate and position the DIC, which is necessary for harmonising infrastructure development across consortia and locations.The DIC is usually an institution within the hospital and is generally closely linked to the clinical computer centres, which ensures a close connection to the healthcare systems. The tasks of the DIC include the transfer of data from various data-providing systems, the consolidation and processing of this data as well as ensuring data quality and data protection. The processed data is then made available for use in medical research.Spokespersons of the DIC Management Forum:Dr Michaela Hardt, University Hospital TbingenTimo Fuchs, University Hospital Regensburg

Health Research Data Infrastructure Coordination Group (GFDI)










              Health research data infrastructures support the collection, aggregation, quality assurance and provision of personal data from routine care and health research. The challenges of such an infrastructure are diverse: complex data collection and storage, technical, legal and cultural hurdles as well as fragmentation and the formation of silos.             

In order to overcome these challenges, the MII and NUM coordination offices have set up a national coordination group for publicly funded health research data infrastructures. Its aim is to promote transparency about existing and planned infrastructures, develop a common approach and draw up a model for the usage of health-related data. The activities of the coordination group are supported by the BMBF's "Forum Gesundheitsforschung".

Dialogue Forum










              The Dialogue Forum allows representatives from the various groups to exchange ideas and information. Participants include patient advocacy
groups, policy makers, government agencies funding organisations, research centres and other scientific institutions, and healthcare IT industry organisations. The forum ensures that strategic planning is discussed, agreed and supported by all stakeholders.


The dialogue forum is an external body that advises the national steering committee. It is a means of involving all relevant stakeholders in strategic planning and ongoing development of the medical informatics initiative.
Dialogue forum members are appointed by the national steering committee. They include representatives of patient advocacy groups, policy makers, government agencies, research centres and other scientific institutions, and healthcare IT industry organisations. The first meeting took place on 26 January 2017 within the scope of the annual general meeting of the medical informatics initiative, and successfully initiated highly constructive exchange.

Patient participation










              Medical Informatics Initiative in dialogue with patient representatives            

The aim of the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), is to enhance research and patient care through innovative IT solutions. These will enable the sharing and use of data from healthcare and from clinical and biomedical research across multiple entities and sites.
Workshop 2019: "Health data for medical research: How can patients participate?"



But how do citizens in Germany feel about their health data being used for research? Are they willing to provide it in the form of a "data donation"? How can and do patients want to participate in data-driven medical research? And how will new technologies influence their opportunities for participation?
These questions were the focus of an MII workshop on patient participation organised by the TMF - Technology, Methods, and Infrastructure for Networked Medical Research, which took place on 27 August 2019 in Berlin, Germany. Approximately 150 experts in ethics, law, research and patient organisations discussed the willingness of patients to participate in medical research.

Interactive online dialogue event series 2020/21



Based on the results of this first MII workshop on the topic of patient participation, the MII launched the interactive online event series "Medical Informatics Initiative in dialogue with patient representatives" in September 2020 to actively engage in an exchange with patient advocacy groups and patient representatives in Germany. The aim of the format is to provide transparent information about the use of data and research in the framework of the MII and to integrate ideas and feedback from patient organisations at an early stage.

National Release Center










              From January 1st, 2021, Germany is a member state of SNOMED International. The medical terminology makes it possible to clearly map medical terms in different computer systems internationally. SNOMED CT thus creates the prerequisite for the electronic exchange of health data. From January 1st, 2021, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) is responsible for the provision and further development of SNOMED CT in Germany as the National Release Centre. Obtaining a sublicense for SNOMED CT is free of charge for users in Germany.

Further information on the introduction of SNOMED CT in Germany within the framework of the Medical Informatics Initiative:



Since mid-March 2020, SNOMED CT has been available for the first time in Germany via the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII). As participants in the MII, almost all German university hospitals and other partners in the initiative have received a SNOMED CT license. The license fees in this pilot phase were borne by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The TMF - Technology, Methods, and Infrastructure for Networked Medical Research, head office of the MII coordination office, acted as the National Release Centre during this phase.

Participation










              The medical informatics initiative is open in nature. The goal is for funded consortia to recruit additional partners over the course of the project, and share successful solutions with others at a later date.            

Moreover, other sites or organisations - including non-university sites - that would like to establish a data integration center and join the MII research data infrastructure can contact the MII consortia or the MII coordination office for this purpose.
To ensure researchers, doctors and, ultimately, patients benefit fully from these advances, further actors  for example outpatient care and private clinics  will be increasingly involved in data exchange.
Funding is modular in structure and divided into phases to enable responsiveness to realworld developments and changing needs in the coming years. There will also be additional funding modules from the commencement of the development and networking phase; if necessary, the BMBF will publish specific funding policies.

Template text for patient consent forms










The challenge:


Detailed consent provided by a patient or clinical study participant plays a decisive role in determining how personal health data can be used for future research. For the consistent use of data for medical research across Germany, it is critical to ensure essential elements of patient information and consent forms are standardised. Not all future research goals are known at the time the data are captured. It is therefore necessary to describe potential future use of data for research and healthcare in very general terms when a patient/participant declares consent (broad consent). German legislation governing data protection and hospital activities varies from state to state in terms of what research can be conducted using patient-care data without explicit consent. Similarly, there is no consensus among state oversight agencies with regard to how broad consent should be worded.Achievements to date:All participating university hospitals have agreed on a strictly consent-based approach: while in hospital, the patient is asked to consent to future use of clinical data on the basis of clearly expressed information. They have agreed on a standardised template text for both patient information and consent. This includes identical consent options for patients, enabling data to be used consistently across sites and consortia at a later date. The expertise of recognized actors and organizations throughout Germany, such as the Biobanks Working Group of the Medical Ethics Committee and the Data Protection Working Group of the TMF, has been incorporated into the development and coordination of the template text.  Established dialogue procedures between the relevant working groups and the TMF - Technology and Methods Platform for Networked Medical Research e.V. as an association of scientific experts were used for coordination with the data protection authorities of the federal states.Explanatory film for patients:

The Medical Informatics Initiatives core data set










The consortia of the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) and all participating university hospital sites have agreed upon a common set of core data. This is based on international IT and terminology standards, and is the prerequisite for shared use of data. Within the MIIs corresponding working groups, the university hospital sites across all consortia defined what data records must, at a minimum, be captured and stored by the MIIs data integration centres for all in-patients  independent of medical indication and of each consortiums specific use case. This guarantees interoperability between data integration centres despite their diverse underlying concepts.



Patient care data are highly diverse. They originate from multiple source IT systems, and are sometimes structured, and sometimes unstructured. They differ in scope, defined format and content (medical significance, semantics). As a result, the proposed data integration centres face not just the challenge of consolidating data from multiple sources from a purely technical standpoint, but also of achieving a degree of standardisation that enables data analysis at acceptable effort and expense, and with transparent data quality  making them available for a variety of medical research purposes. This requires harmonisation across all sites and consortia to enable data to be effectively utilised in data integration centres throughout Germany.
The MII core data set is divided into basic and extension modules. The  are generic in nature, and are not confined to any one discipline. The extension modules model data for specific areas of application or disciplines, and are included in data requests/applications in line with the needs of the research topic. The MII core data set is subject to continuous and sustainable development in line with real-world needs, and on the basis of international consultation and agreement.



Block diagram of the core data set: References from individual modules can be made to individual treatment cases or to the person only. Cross-references between modules are possible (and desirable). The structural data module contains data without references to patients and therefore has no connections to the other modules.The first version of the MII core data set was approved in March 2017 in the form of a text description. The inclusion of any given module in the set was made dependent on the following criteria:
Relevance to research and patient care
Relevance to the consortia use cases
Availability and accessibility of the corresponding data at MII sites
The degree of data structuring and the availability of terminology
The core data set not only prescribes the scope of data, but more importantly standardises the medical content in line with international standards. For example, it was agreed that the core data set be represented by the HL7 FHIR format. For the data sets (further) development, the following tools will be employed: ART-DECOR for data set modelling and Forge/Simplifier.net for the generation and publishing of profiles in HL7 FHIR. The terminology to be used for semantic encoding depends on the specific module, e.g. LOINC for the laboratory test results module.

Contract governing the use of patient data, biosamples, analytical methods and routines within the framework of the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII)













The challenge:
It is a central goal of the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) to create a harmonised framework and standardised rules throughout Germany for the exchange and use of patient data and biosamples for medical research purposes. To guarantee secure and ethical data usage and robust data protection for medical research, it is necessary to establish the corresponding technical and organisational means, in particular the appropriate legislative basis.
Achievements to date: 
To this end, the MII member university hospitals have developed and agreed a contract that governs the terms and conditions of cross-site use of patient data and biosamples in individual cases within the framework of the MII.
The contract was agreed with all legal departments of the funded university hospital sites and was approved by the MIIs National Steering Committee (NSG) on 6 October 2020. The MII has therefore taken an important step towards achieving consensus on the legal framework for cross-site data use for medical research. The contract comprises a (main) contractual document and an appendix of general terms and conditions (Version 1.3). It is currently being trialled under real-world conditions. Notes on the contract, providing an overview of the structure and goals of the MII, and the key basis of, background to, and origins of the contracts development, can be found in the corresponding hand-out.
The contract drew on the extensive expertise of the legal departments of participating university hospital sites, and of leading research facilities, study centres, national research associations and cross-site research projects.
In addition, the NSG has approved an MII-agreed hard-copy form, developed for capturing the content required for the standardised data use application (Version 1.0). This will serve as the basis for the technical implementation and further development of the content of the digital application template for the MII.

Using routine medical data for research projects










              Online learning platform"MII-Academy" bundles knowledge for clinical researchers            

Berlin, 08/04/2024. The Medical Informatics Initiative (MII), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, has established structures and processes to make healthcare data accessible for research. These infrastructures represent considerable added value for clinical researchers. With the online learning platform "MII-Academy", the MII supports clinical researchers in using the opportunities created for their own projects in a targeted manner. In video-based learning units, researchers learn how to apply for and analyse medical data for their research project. The learning platform is now available online.The Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) and the associated establishment of Data Integration Centres (DIC) at (university) hospitals are creating new opportunities to use routine healthcare data for research purposes across disciplines and locations. The tasks of the DIC include the transfer of data from various data-providing systems, the consolidation and processing of this data as well as ensuring data quality and data protection. The processed data is then made available for medical research. Based on the data volumes obtained, research with clinical care data can help to identify diseases more precisely and optimise patient care.MII-Academy creates knowledge transfer


The aim of the MII-Academy is to raise awareness of the structures and opportunities created in the MII and to support clinical researchers in using them. This complements other supporting measures such as the call for proposals for data use projects and general offers for the public. The online learning platform uses video tutorials to provide practical background knowledge and recommendations on the services and usage processes of the MII. Based on the experience of the SMITH Academy, which was developed in the SMITH consortium during the first funding period of the MII (2018-2022), the MII-Academy follows a modular concept. The modules are divided into four main topics: Overview, Basic knowledge to support in-house research, Advanced methods of data analysis and Special topics of data preparation and analysis. The topics build on each other, increasing in complexity step by step. Users can determine the order in which they work through the topics according to their own level of knowledge and repeat modules several times, regardless of time and place.With the MII-Academy, we teach doctors and researchers how to use the MII infrastructure to answer innovative medical research questions with routine data from patient care, i.e. real world data," explains Prof. Dr. Toralf Kirsten, Professor of Medical Data Science at Leipzig University, who was in charge of developing the MII-Academy concept.Continuous expansion and ongoing updates are plannedThe MII-Academy will be continuously expanded and improved by contributions from MII stakeholders in order to provide a comprehensive range of content that meets the needs of clinical researchers. Currently, there is an initial selection of videos and topics at each level of the learning platform. New learning materials are constantly being developed to increase the variety of topics available. Self-tests are also being planned to help participants deepen their understanding and check their knowledge independently. There are also plans to set up regular online consultation hours. This will give users the opportunity to ask questions about the content and discuss specific problems. The MII-Academy sees itself as a comprehensive support service and is accessible to all interested parties without participation restrictions. The learning platform is operated by the University of Leipzig and is closely integrated into the MII's other training and advisory activities.Further information and access to the MII-Academy can be found at:.Press contact:Sophie Haderer, Tel.: 030  22 00 24 732, Mobil: 0173 4054214, E-Mail: Hintergrundinformationen zur MII:The aim of the MII is to digitally network routine data from patient care throughout Germany and make it available for medical research in order to treat diseases faster and more effectively in the future. All of Germany's university medical centres are working on this together with non-university hospitals, research institutions, companies, health insurance companies and patient representatives in the four consortia DIFUTURE, HiGHmed, MIRACUM and SMITH. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is funding the MII with a total of over 480 million euros up to and including 2026. Data protection and data security are top priorities.The MII has been building data infrastructures at university hospitals since 2018. The MII partners have already demonstrated the benefits of their IT solutions in practice using a wide range of use cases - from intensive care to oncology. The focus of the consolidation and extension phase (2023-2026) is on extended collaboration between the university hospitals and their cooperation with new partners, particularly from regional healthcare.An important component of this infrastructure is the German Portal for Medical Research Data (FDGP). It is intended to serve not only MII partners, but also all researchers as a central point of contact if they want to use data and biosamples from university medicine. The FDPG is also aimed at the general public. It makes transparent which projects are conducting research with patient data and what results have emerged.In addition, the BMBF is funding six "Digital Hubs: Advances in Research and Health Care (2021-2025) as part of the MII. Their task (initially in pilot projects) is to integrate the pioneering work of the university hospitals into other areas of the healthcare system: from outpatient care in practices to rehabilitation and aftercare. To strengthen research and teaching in the field of digital health, the BMBF is also supporting newly established professorships with a total of 21 junior research groups (2020-2026).A coordination office is responsible for the national coordination of developments within the MII, which is operated by the TMF (Technology, Methods and Infrastructure for Networked Medical Research) together with the MFT (German Association of Medical Faculties) and VUD (German Association of Academic Medical Centres) in Berlin.To the online learning platform "MII-Academy":
