Via data derived from various primary and secondary healthcare settings, we are able to predict efficacy and possible side effects of medication. In this way PHARMO Institute wants to contribute to health innovation and health optimization. For our observational studies disease-specific cohorts are created from the various databases.

Our mission is to achieve greater insights into the real world of healthcare, through the collection and expert analysis of patient-centric information.

Our internal standardised procedures and quality guidelines are in accordance with the ENCePP Guide on Methodological Standards in Pharmacoepidemiology and the ENCePP Code of Conduct (www.encepp.eu) to guarantee high quality services.

We are performing pharmacoepidemiological studies including project management, methodology, data quality and stakeholders communication at an European level. We perform post-authorisation safety or effectiveness studies (PASS + PAES), drug utilisation studies (DUR), studies on safety outcomes and many other types of studies

At PHARMO Institute we have been studying the use, effectiveness and side effects of medicines, as they are used in daily practice for many years. We use large files of data from millions of patients to investigate why and how often medicines are less effective or even cause side effects. 

PHARMO Institute is the place you turn when you need substantiated, authoritative evidence.

 PHARMO Institute is dedicated to the study of epidemiology, drug utilization, drug safety and health outcomes. 



As an independent research organization, we study the effects of drug treatments in real life to enhance the health of people using medication. In that way we contribute to drug safety and are able to find unwanted side effects in advance.We base our studies on databases derived from general practitioners, hospitals, labs, different disease related databases and in- and out-patient pharmacies, which are anonymized by STIZON and used to follow the disease course and effects of medication during and after the treatment.

PHARMO Data 















 PHARMO DataThe longitudinal nature of the data that the PHARMO Institute has access to, enables the follow-up more than 10 million persons of a well-defined population in the Netherlands for an average of twelve years. Currently, over 7 million active persons out of 17 million inhabitants of the Netherlands are captured. Data collection period, catchment area and overlap between data sources differ. Therefore, the final cohort size for any study will depend on the data sources included. As data sources are linked on an annual basis, the average lag time of the data is one year. All electronic patient records include information on age, sex, socioeconomic status and mortality. Other available information depends on the data source.

Data sources 



The PHARMO Institute has access to study-specific datasets derived from a network of electronic healthcare databases encompassing anonymous data from different primary and secondary healthcare settings in the Netherlands. These different data sources are linked on a patient level through validated algorithms. To ensure the privacy of the data, the collection, processing, linkage and anonymisation of the data is performed by STIZON. STIZON is an independent, ISO/IEC 27001 certified foundation, which acts as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) between the data sources and the PHARMO Institute.

Recent studies suggest that women are more susceptible to diuretic-induced hyponatremia resulting in hospital admission than men. The aim of this study was to confirm whether these sex differences in hyponatremia related hospital admissions in diuretic users remain after adjusting for several confounding variables such as age, dose, and concurrent medication.

A high degree of adherence to direct oral anticoagulants is essential for reducing the risk of ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, owing to the rapid decline in anticoagulation activity when doses are omitted (i.e. rebound effect).

Due to established teratogenicity of valproates, the EU risk minimisation measures (RMMs) with a pregnancy prevention programme (PPP) for valproate were updated in March 2018.

GPs have been shown to be important providers of medical care during pregnancy, however, little evidence exists on their awareness of pregnancy when prescribing medication to women. AIM: To assess GPs awareness of pregnancy and its association with prescribing medication with potential safety risks.

The COVID19 pandemic has a large impact worldwide and is known to particularly affect the older population. This paper outlines the protocol for external validation of prognostic models predicting mortality risk after presentation with COVID19 in the older population. These prognostic models were originally developed in an adult population and will be validated in an older population ( 70 years of age) in three healthcare settings: the hospital setting, the primary care setting, and the nursing home setting.





			4 April 2023		










The large-scale COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in 2021 and 2022 led to a rapid increase in numbers of received adverse event reports in spontaneous reporting systems. As background incidences of naturally occurring medical events became increasingly relevant for causality assessment of potential associations with the vaccines, a novel approach for signal detection was warranted. The O/E method is a useful approach for signal detection of potential adverse reactions when handling large numbers of ICSRs. Further research is needed to attest to the causality on a clinical basis.

Low-dose rivaroxaban has been indicated for the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) after recent (2019-2020) updates to European guidelines. We aimed to describe prescription trends of low-dose rivaroxaban in ASCVD patients over the period 2015-2022 in two European countries, to compare the trends before and after guideline changes, and to determine the characteristics of users

The safety and effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus vitamin K antagonists (standard of care [SOC]) for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) was evaluated in Europe. Observational studies were conducted in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden. Primary safety outcomes were hospitalization for intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, or urogenital bleeding among new users of rivaroxaban and SOC with NVAF; outcomes were analyzed using cohort (rivaroxaban or SOC use) and nested casecontrol designs (current vs nonuse). Statistical analyses comparing rivaroxaban and SOC cohorts were not performed.





			16 February 2023		










Patient characteristics of new rivaroxaban users with non-valvular atrial fibrillation changed between 2011 and 2016/17, but changes differed between countries. These patterns have methodological implications. They have to be considered in the interpretation of observational studies comparing effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulants, especially regarding potential bias due to unmeasured confounding.

Myocarditis and pericarditis associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
Together with colleagues across Europe we have recently published our work entitled Myocarditis and pericarditis associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: a population-based descriptive cohort and a nested self-controlled risk interval study using electronic health care data from four European countries in Frontiers in Pharmacology.
In this multi-country study that used data from four countries, the researchers studied first myo-/pericarditis diagnosis after exposure to first and second dose of Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines. The study followed the design of a population-based cohort study with nested self-controlled risk interval (SCRI). Individuals were followed from 01/01/2020 until end of data availability (31/12/2021 latest).
Over 35 million individuals (492% women, median age 3949years) were included, of which 574% received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Baseline incidence of myocarditis was low. Myocarditis IRRs were elevated after vaccination in those aged < 30years, after both Pfizer vaccine doses (IRR = 33, 95%CI 12-9.4; 78, 95%CI 26-235, respectively) and Moderna vaccine dose 2 (IRR = 61, 95%CI 11-335). An effect of AstraZeneca vaccine dose 2 could not be excluded (IRR = 242, 95%CI 096-607). Pericarditis was not associated with vaccination. Important to note is that the absolute incidence of myocarditis remains low.
Please read the  to check more detailed methodology and results.

Stichting Informatievoorziening voor Zorg en Onderzoek (STIZON)
The PHARMO Database Network is created by , in which STIZON acts as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) between the data sources and the PHARMO Institute. STIZON is authorised by the data providers to manage and process the identifiable patient data. STIZON collects and maintains the identifiable patient data retrieved from the various healthcare providers (e.g. general practitioners and pharmacists) and links the data on a patient level. Before the PHARMO Database Network can be used for research by the PHARMO Institute the data is depleted of personal information that may be traced back to persons (such as date of birth).

 At some point in our lives, we all have to use a form of medication. An aspirine against a headach, a vaccination to resist a virus, antibiotics to eliminate a bacterial infection or perhaps a longer trial te fight cancer. Some chronical diseases have patients bound to medicines for the rest of their lives. Medicines do not always do what they promise to do. Due to physical differences and differences in our daily use of medicine, the effects of medicine can vary strongly.At PHARMO Institute we have been studying the use, effectiveness and side effects of medicines, as they are used in daily practice for many years. We use large files of data from millions of patients to investigate why and how often medicines are less effective or even cause side effects.PHARMO Institute is the place you turn when you need substantiated, authoritative evidence. We are scientists firstacademically trained, credentialed researchers who know how and when to apply the appropriate research methodologies to your realworld applications and situations. We care about doing whats right and whats relevant, so medical professionals and patients can make good, safe, and timely decisions about pharmaceutical products.

Privacy policy
Using PHARMO data
The use of the PHARMO data is controlled by the independent Compliance Committee STIZON / PHARMO Institute. The Compliance Committee STIZON / PHARMO Institute consists of representatives of the participating data suppliers and a privacy expert (chairman of this committee). Each study requires permission from this Committee. Prior permission is required dependent on the detail of use of data. For each study, the research question, the data used for the study, the methods used to analyze the data, and the people/organizations who commissioned the study have to be described.
All decisions of the Compliance Committee STIZON / PHARMO Institute are based on the applicable legislation in the Netherlands, e.g. the Personal Data Protection Act and the Medical Treatment Contract Act. Within this legal framework, the Code of Conduct Use of Data in Health Research is an important document for the interpretation of the use of this kind of data for scientific research in the Netherlands, and is approved by the Dutch Data Protection Authority ().
Informed Consent
As soon as any form of intervention or change in routine care is involved in a study, informed consent must be obtained. In addition, explicit ethical approval of a certified Ethical Committee must be obtained. If, for example, patients are to be enrolled in studies, or if additional tests need to be performed in the context of a study, Dutch law mandates informed consent. That is, there is a clear distinction between the analysis of routinely collected data, and conducting a study that requires additional tests or procedures.
Any study that involves additional tests or procedures is submitted to a certified Ethical Review Board in the Netherlands.
