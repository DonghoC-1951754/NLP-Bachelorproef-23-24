Data and information























How we look after your information
Collecting data on health and care is an important part of our role in the health service. We collect and store some information from people's health and care records so that it can be used to run the health service, manage epidemics, plan for the future and research health conditions, diseases and treatments. We always make sure data we collect is handled securely and in line with the law. We don't hold your medical records.

internal

All health and social care organisations connecting to the NHS Spine must have a valid NHS Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate in place to ensure encrypted patient data is transmitted securely.  First generation (G1) certificates are expiring in 2024.   All certificates should be updated to the second generation (G2) certificates by 2nd May 2024 to avoid any loss of service.   NHS E will be making changes to their internal services week commencing the 6th May where spine and associated services will only be accepting and issuing on the G2 certificates. If you have not made the required changes, you will lose service.

Improving the NHSs most fundamental process

















Feature

Improving the NHSs most fundamental process
A new service is making registering with a GP easier for patients and for practices. A quarter of GP practices in England are already on board.















For Adelina Pashova, the benefits of the were summed up in a very quick conversation. 



There was a mum sitting in the waiting room. She had just given birth, says Pashova, digital and transformation lead at the Harrow East Primary Care Network. When I told her about the new digital application form, she went straight on her phone and she had completed her childs registration in 3 to 5 minutes. Thats it.
There were more than 6.8 million GP registration applications by patients last year. While seemingly routine, Pashova says, the Register with a GP surgery services simplification and systematisation of this most fundamental of NHS processes  the gateway into NHS care  is a major time-saver for providers like hers and a boon for patients.
They can register at any time, day or night, without having to fit in with practice opening times. They no longer need to be physically present at the surgery, which is especially helpful for those who may have mobility issues, live further away from the practice, or have busy schedules. It is accessible. Its easier for people without English as a first language as it can be used with online translation tools and there are standardised paper forms for people who need those. Its just better, she says. 










                    More than 650,000 patient submissions
                







About 20,000 new registrations are submitted each week 






Growing fast
            

Register with a GP surgery was launched in August 2022. The central offering is a simple and standardised online registration form that is fully integrated with patient-facing digital services like the NHS App, NHS login and NHS Find a GP.
More than 1,900 GP practices are now live and the service is processing about 20,000 patient submissions a week.
William Leachman, an enrolment lead with the service, says integration with NHS digital services is a key part its appeal.
A patient registration doesnt really start with completing a form. The patient has to find the GP in the first place. Were connected with the NHS Find a GP service. So, when they put their post code into Find a GP, links will come up showing relevant practices and, for those that have signed up to Register with a GP surgery, patients can just click through and start registering, according to Leachman. 










                    93% patient satisfaction rating
                







across all age groups 





Integration with the NHS App adds approximately 33 million recorded app users with swift access and NHS login users have information such as their NHS number automatically available from their accounts.
Leachman says many 16 to 35 year olds expect a digitised service and adopt it immediately, but that the service's 93% patient satisfaction rating across all age groups shows a strong general appeal. For the minority of patients for whom a digital service isnt appropriate, Register with a GP surgery offers a standardised and accessible paper form. 










We spend less time on tasks such as photocopying, scanning paper registration forms and manually uploading them onto clinical systems.                


Adelina Pashova,
                        Digital and Transformation Lead,
                            
Harrow East Primary Care Network









Less admin
            

From practices point of view, the service not only helps their patients but saves lots of time. Register with a GP surgery is matching patients to their NHS numbers with a 90% match rate and enrolled practices are experiencing about 3-times fewer exceptions requiring resubmission to Primary Care Support England (PCSE), the national body processing new patient registrations. This reduction in practice staff detective work saves a lot of time that can be used for other things.
Pashova says, the efficiencies are obvious in the back office: We spend less time on tasks such as photocopying, scanning paper registration forms and manually uploading them onto clinical systems. Its saved a huge amount of admin time and has made the process faster  and, of course, it reduces the time that patients need to wait for the surgery to process their registration application. 






AdelinaPashova in Honeypot Medical Centre, Greater London







Nicola Frisby, a digital services manager with NHS South Central and West Commissioning Support Unit with long experience of working with registrations in primary care, says that, while many registrations are straightforward, they can take a lot of time when problems arise.
Sometimes necessary information is not filled in, is inaccurate or illegible, she says: Its not unusual to not be able to read the email or the phone number and, if you have problems with contacting people, it really does take a lot of time getting the information you need.
The new systems automatic catchment area checks take out more admin for practices who need to check patient's locations.
The service is still working to achieve the full integration with GP clinical systems that would allow a direct flow of data from the digital form into GPs records. Currently, a standardised PDF is generated and sent by email to the practice, allowing staff to easily paste information into their system. There are also paid-for 3rd party services that  




Supporting ICBs
            

Gary McFegan, Digital First Project Manager at North Central Integrated Care Board (ICB), says full integration would receive a roar of approval from the user base, but he says the existing system is already an obvious step forward.
We previously ran an 18-month digital registration pilot with 45 practices in North Central London using a different solution and were thrilled with the 22,000 new digital registrations we achieved. All of the practices involved have now transitioned to the Register with a GP surgery service because it matched or exceeded their experience with our previous solution.
Even before we decided as an integrated care board to implement the national service, some of our practices had signed up independently, as they viewed the national tool to be a better option for them. When you have something that is a patient-friendly digital registration option and can also reduce practice admin, its going to be a winner. 










It just lets our practice staff do other things for patients.                


Gary McFegan,

There had been initial scepticism from some practices but their doubts tended to reduce with use.
Some questioned the time saved by registering the patient digitally compared to the traditional method. Some preferred a face-to-face process with ID checking due to concerns about identity. The national services use of NHS login has helped address the ID issue and the time saved is clear  although it rapidly gets absorbed. It just lets our practice staff do other things for patients, McFegan says. 




No practice left behind
            

A dedicated implementation team is working with ICBs, primary care networks (PCNs) and individual practices to switch on Register with a GP surgery access  in a matter of minutes, in many cases.
Support is tailored to the local context. For example, when working with an ICB with many practices within its area with differing needs, the central team might take part in an initial call with practices to explain the service and take questions. Support on communications is provided, with  and web-based information provided centrally, and theres practical support for surgeries that are struggling to get online.

If an ICB is wondering about bringing this to their area, we can now tell them it's already in their area, says Nick Hopkinson, associate director of strategy and engagement on the project. Were live in all 42 ICBs across the country and in some areas about 75% of practices are already signed up. We have a  that allows you to look up your own area and see which practices near you have already signed up. So, colleagues can find out who you can talk to locally about this.
Recent improvements have been made to make it even easier for ICBs to adopt the service across their area. All that is needed is 3 pieces of information  practice name, ODS code and a shared inbox email address  to enable bulk enrolment with the support of the NHS England onboarding support team.

                                Kerrie Hughes, Lead Service Designer for the new Register with a GP surgery service, says registration is more than just paperwork  its about giving more people access to healthcare and helping GP practices to provide great care.

I took part in the second panel discussion of the day, Priorities for improving data management and utilising innovation to improve clinical research outcomes. During this session we covered the digitalisation of clinical trials and platforms to improve accessibility, wearable technology and remote monitoring, and increasing collaboration between patients, research funders, the NHS and research industry. It was an inspirational event and here are my 3 main takeaways. 



                    1.
                Stronger partnerships for better research outcomes
            

While we all acknowledge the significance of more collaborative working to achieve better research outcomes, it requires effort and needs to be anchored in the practicalities of service delivery. However, what struck me during this discussion was the opportunity for NHS DigiTrials, during our current pilot phases, to activate 1 or 2 key partnerships to explore and leverage our collective strengths for greater impact.
Consider, for example, a recruitment of participants for a specific clinical trial, perhaps funded by a medical research charity. NHS DigiTrials would typically work directly with the Clinical Trial Unit, which means we may be inadvertently overlooking the valuable insights and expertise a medical research charity can offer too. This may include direct engagement with expert patient groups such as collaborating on how best to engage with patients in this clinical area, which could in turn enhance sign-up rates and ensure recruitment strategies are tailored to relevant patient populations. The importance of patient-centric approaches was eloquently set out by Dr Sagair Hussain, Director of Research from DEBRA UK.
This way of working is an approach I will take back to the team as we discuss the new tranche of clinical trials scheduled to be onboarded over the next 18 months. 



                    2.
                Decentralised trials removes barriers and releases resource
            

As we continued our discussions around the future of clinical trials, it became clear how important decentralised clinical trials are to improving the diversity of participants and releasing the burden on the NHS. The potential benefits are substantial.
NHS DigiTrials already supports decentralised trials as we can recruit participants from across England, regardless of their location. One of our pilot trials, ASCEND PLUS, exemplifies this approach. It is a virtual trial that tests whether taking a daily tablet that contains semaglutide can help to protect people with type 2 diabetes from suffering heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular events. The 20,000 participants conveniently track their progress by completing questionnaires online or via phone, eliminating the need for 20,000 individuals to travel to an NHS clinic for monitoring.
By making further use of new technologies to remotely monitor patients, such as measuring blood pressure and blood sugar levels at home, we remove barriers that traditionally deterred individuals from participating in trials. Factors like time off work, travel expenses, and associated costs are reduced, which widens participation opportunities and encourages greater participant diversity. 



                    3.
                People centred approach is a positive step forward
            

As we focus on delivering the , it was encouraging to see the continued work from the Health Research Advisory (HRA) on , which identifies 9 hallmarks of what good looks like. I am also looking forward to seeing the published guidance from the HRA on how we can make it easier for people to take part in clinical trials, as this will help shape the NHS DigiTrials service going forward. 
This builds on the work NHS England, HRA and other stakeholders are doing to support the delivery of the government's vision: , specifically at a local level where NHS Englands Research Engagement Network Development programme is developing research engagement networks across the 42 ICBs, with communities who are often underserved by research, read more about how we are .
It was truly inspiring to share a platform with leaders from across the research industry, all united by a common goal: to enhance the speed and diversity of clinical trials in the UK, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes. It's crucial to be part of these discussions to ensure NHS DigiTrials evolves and aligns with the wider clinical research ecosystem and I look forward to future opportunities for the team.

How were transforming our digital service catalogue





























Blog

How were transforming our digital service catalogue
Thasmim Ali describes the changes weve made to our digital service catalogue to make it easier for our stakeholders to find out and understand what national digital services are available for NHS staff and organisations to use.



Author:




                            , Product Owner
                    




Date:

                                        7 March 2024
                                














NHS England provides more than 100 national digital services for the NHS. Theyre listed in the  on the NHS England Digital website.
However, after speaking with digital leaders across the system, our Who Does What programme team identified two important problems. 













First, our stakeholders were unaware of the different types of digital services available to them in the NHS. We know that local NHS organisations want to know about these central services so they don't end up duplicating efforts by creating or buying something similar  but theyre not clear whats on offer.
Second, our stakeholders didnt understand what our national services do. The way they were being described in the catalogue wasnt working well, leading to a lack of understanding and connection between the services offered nationally and the local healthcare bodies. This meant that stakeholders were less likely to invest in a digital service that they didnt fully understand.
Our goal was to solve these problems by transforming the service catalogue. 




Our approach
            

We approached this problem by talking directly to users through user research and collaborating with internal stakeholders.
This is what were doing: 



                    1.
                Enhancing the service catalogue
            

Drawing inspiration from the , we upgraded the service catalogue by incorporating tags, filters, and an in-page search function.
We did this to provide a more navigable and user-friendly experience. Finding information about the services is now easier. 



                    2.
                Standardising service pages
            

Recognising the importance of clarity and consistency, the team introduced a standardised template for service pages. The template acts like a guide, making sure the information meets users needs, and keeps a clear and consistent presentation of services throughout the catalogue.
We have successfully implemented these enhancements on 24 out of 105 service pages so far, and were doing more every month. 



                    3.
                Collaborating with service-owning teams
            

An important part of the service catalogue transformation has been our collaboration with service-owning teams. We worked closely to update their service pages and transition to the new standardised template, using their expertise in the service and understanding of their audience. Though it takes time and effort, this process makes sure our service descriptions are consistent and make sense to the reader.
It's worth noting that, in our ongoing work, the team recognises that the standard template may not be a one-size-fits-all solution. As we collaborate with more services, we understand that flexibility is key.
If the content doesn't align with or suit a specific audience, teams are encouraged to use the template loosely or adapt it accordingly to better meet their service's unique needs and objectives. 



                    4.
                Discovery research and testing
            

We are conducting several types of user research to gain a full picture of the problem space. We are speaking directly to users in interviews to fully understand their goals and what is stopping them from achieving them. We have also been using tools such as surveys and heat mapping to observe how users interact with our content and what their user journey looks like.
To make sure our upgrades are solving a problem or meeting a need, we're doing real user testing. Surveys and user research help us fine-tune the catalogue based on what users want and need. 



                    5.
                Working with the Digital Partnering team
            

We work closely with the Digital Partnering team, who help NHS digital leaders to problem-solve and introduce new centrally built digital services. They also facilitate engagement with regional trusts for beta pilots.
Acting as a vital link between us and the broader NHS, these relationship managers showcase the service catalogue to the correct audience.
The relationship managers also work closely with NHS England product teams, following a shared plan from the . Wider NHS organisations can see whats on offer in this central hub to avoid buying into products that already exist. They also have the opportunity to get support from central NHS England product teams. 



                    6.
                Meeting web team requirements
            

We collaborate closely with the web team, who oversees the NHS England Digital website where the service catalogue is hosted. When we make changes like adding new tags or filters, it can have a broader impact on the site and use up the web team's resources. So, we need to be mindful of the effects of our actions on their workload. Our objective is to fulfil their requirements and ensure that our contributions align with their strategic plans. 




Outcomes so far
            

Measuring progress is an essential aspect of this transformative journey. Our team can now provide a tangible count of the number of service pages successfully transformed. The user research conducted by the team continues to help us shape our design approach, based on the feedback and insights gathered from our internal and external audiences.
However, the true measure of success lies in the outcomes achieved. For our service, that means reducing the time it takes for people to discover and learn about our services, and more importantly, getting our national services adopted (for free) instead of NHS organisations buying their own product. 




What's next
            

Were committed to improving the service based on user feedback. Right now, we're giving extra attention to continuously improving our service pages. This includes the incorporation of extra filters, such as care settings and status (for example, in development, live or retired) to further refine the user experience.
Decision makers in integrated care systems want clear information on what's coming up, whats right for their organisations, and how the services are going to develop. Weve got to make sure roadmaps are reliable, on track, and aligned across different services. We're asking users and service teams for their ideas on how to improve them.
In terms of new features, we are looking particularly at potential collaboration with the Digital Partnering Hub, which brings together relevant information and data together for the CIO community and programmes. 
Looking ahead, our goal is to offer reliable and user-friendly digital solutions for integrated care board decision makers, service teams and users that, ultimately, improve healthcare.

We had to follow the data, not our users





























Blog

We had to follow the data, not our users
Chiara Garattini and Kate Burn explain how working in our Data and Analytics sub-directorate has challenged the assumptions of our user-centred design team.



Authors:




                            , Lead User Researcher, NHS England
                    


                            , Lead Service Designer, NHS England
                    




Date:

                                        27 February 2024
                                














A big part of early work on projects typically involves helping our colleagues to focus a bit less on the characteristics of their products and the requirements of their internal processes, and to instead start by involving users to understand their needs.
Therefore, it's been interesting to work on projects that required our team to get deep into the weeds of the process in order to, ultimately, put the focus back on users. 













Working with NHS data
            

We started working in Data and Analytics (at the time, part of NHS Digital) 3 years ago, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. NHS data  in the response to that national crisis  and continues to be central both to the future of our health and care system and the day-to-day delivery of services.
We are at the centre of this work: the custodian of health and care data in England. Sounds simple, but it actually encompasses a very wide range of processes and types of information, many touch points with many different people.
We first needed to understand what services we deliver, who uses each of them and what for. The answer from our colleagues very often seemed to be that our services are for "everyone", and that isnt specific enough to be useful. When we dug further, the answer had become: "everyone who has a role in providing or using health data for the benefits of the public and the health and care system". Again, not an identifiable user group with actionable needs. 










They needed different things from us depending on their task rather than necessarily on their roles and competencies.                









We asked, "what are the tasks that people who use data for the benefit of the health and care system do?" and started coming up with various categories of people and their expertise. For example, data skills, technology proficiency and clinical knowledge. From there, we were able to get to some large categories of users, such as clinical and clerical staff, analysts and data specialists, scientists and researchers, and policy and service planners and decision makers.
But even this didnt help as much as we expected. These user groups tended to crop up across the services we were seeking to understand. They had very different and discrete needs depending on where we encountered them.
Similar users were coming from a wide variety of different organisations, from academic research institutions, to service providers and commercial entities, and they needed different things from us depending on their task rather than necessarily on their roles and competencies. It wasnt as simple as clinical and clerical staff needing one set of things from us, and academics needing something else. 




Following the data
            

We took a different tack. Could we understand the process by following the thing we were working with? Instead of looking at the journey taken by the people using and interacting with our data, would looking at the data instead help us make sense of our services and users?
We started following what we called the life-course trajectory of the data. First, we looked at the birth and development of data. We mapped how it was created in a particular context; how some of this data was then submitted to us via different technical means and forms; how the data was stored, cleaned, curated, processed, and readied for use; how it was moved again in this new form into another place where it could be accessed and analysed; and finally, how it was transformed and published as different artefacts: dashboards, articles and visualisations.
We mapped what we knew of the kinds of people inside and outside our organisation who were involved at each of these stages. Who were they? What were their skills? What were their needs? 






Major steps in the data journey







Using the insights gained from this detailed investigation, we were able to establish that we had 4 large service areas:

Data provision and ingestion
Data transformation and curation
Data access provision and dissemination
Data-outputs publication

A new operating model was implemented in 2022 with these 4 areas at its backbone and our technical colleagues responded well to the division. We started making headway in our conversations: "Yes, now I can tell you who our users are for this and for that area of service" is what we started to hear. 




Returning to our users
            

We are aware that our focus on the data and its journey raised the risk of designing services and making technology decisions that would benefit the data, its quality, its speed, and its timeliness over actual benefits to users. In the end, the goal must be to focus on what people need.
By following the data and mapping where it flows through our organisation, we were able to establish a common view among senior stakeholders and service owners of what our services are, where they start and end, which products they involve, and who uses these services for what. This map became a go-to tool to agree and communicate where work sat. It allowed colleagues with different expertise and perspectives to come together and coordinate efforts to deliver great data services that will increase the potential for data to save lives.
Health data is wonderfully complex, and working and designing for it  and with it is hard. A lot of things are fixed or unchangeable and trying to do user-centred design in this area can sometimes be confusing and even overwhelming. But it is important, interesting, and fascinating work and critical to the future of our health and care system.

NHS Digital slavery and human trafficking statement
















NHS Digital slavery and human trafficking statement
NHS Digital does not tolerate modern slavery in any of its forms of slavery and servitude, forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking within our activities or our supply chain.
We continue to fully support the government's objective to eradicate modern slavery and human trafficking and we acknowledge our role in both combating it and supporting victims. We are committed to ensuring our supply chains and business activities are free from ethical and labour standards abuse.











Page contents










































About NHS Digital
            

The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), known as NHS Digital, was set up by the Department of Health and Social Care in April 2013 and is an executive non-departmental public body.
Our teams design, developand operate the national IT and data services that support clinicians at work, help patients get the best care, and use data to improve health and care. 




Current policies and initiatives
            






People
            

Our Human Resources (HR) policies provide processes and procedures to ensure that our employees and those employed in our supply chain are treated fairly at all times.
These include:

confirming the identities of all new employees and their right to legally work in the United Kingdom and appointing staff subject to references, immigration checks and identity checks. This ensures that we can be confident, before staff begin employment, that our staff have a legal right to work within the organisation
having a set of values and behaviours that staff are expected to comply with, with all candidates expected to demonstrate these attributes as part of the recruitment selection process
adopting the national pay, terms and conditions of service means that we have the assurance that all staff will be treated fairly and that pay, terms and conditions will comply with the latest legislation. This includes the assurance that staff received, at least, the National Minimum Wage from 1 April 2022
implementing employment policies and procedures designed to provide guidance and advice to staff and managers and to comply with employment legislation. These are accessible to all staff via our intranet
committing to creating and ensuring a non-discriminatory and respectful working environment for our staff, in line with our corporate social responsibilities
providing a platform for our employees to raise concerns about poor working practices, through the implementation of policies covering equality, diversity and inclusion; grievance; respect and dignity at work; and whistleblowing
implemented a Safe to Challenge reporting service which provides staff with an additional independent, confidential route to raise concerns and seek advice
implemented a network of Freedom to Speak Up Guardians with appropriate training, who will act as agents of equity and inclusion within the business.
ensuring appropriate mechanisms to regularly review and track progress on promoting and supporting diversity and inclusion, both as an employer and service provider. This includes the publication and monitoring of trends in our Workforce data as well as our use of Equality Impact Assessments (EIA) to inform the development of people processes and the services we provide
requiring all staff to undertake mandatory training in relation to diversity and inclusion
 




NHS Digital Whistleblowing policy
            

Our Whistleblowing policy gives a platform for employees to raise concerns for further investigation and offers support to individuals that have suffered fiscal or professional detriment as a result of whistleblowing. 




Procurement and our supply chain
            

Over the last year we have continued to take steps to identify, prevent and mitigate modern slavery in our procurement and supply chains. We have adopted the Procurement Policy Note 05/19: Tackling Modern Slavery in Government Supply Chains through updated policy, process and training.

We have supported the compliance of modern slavery and human rights awareness and prevention standards amongst our staff. We have provided access to relevant training for procurement and commercial staff at all levels, including ethics training accredited by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS); 100% of commercials permanent team members had completed this training at the point of the CIPS Kitemark renewal in November 2021. New members of staff, joining since this date, are required to complete the training by November 2022 to ensure compliance to this standard. This training supports staff in understanding how to identify modern slavery and how to tackle it effectively in supply chains, both in existing contracts and new procurement activity. As such, we hold CIPS Ethics accreditation.

Our standard contracts for the supply of goods, service and works contain terms regarding modern slavery principles and are reviewed during our due diligence and assurance process. We also use Government framework agreements including the Crown Commercial Service frameworks, to procure common commodity goods and services, as well as the NHS Terms and Conditions where applicable. These each set out the behaviours that buyers and suppliers can expect of each other throughout procurement and supply chain relationships, including specific provisions on modern slavery and compliance with relevant legislation. Additionally, we have updated our Commercial Policy and supporting processes to provide awareness of the Modern Slavery Helpline

We look to provide continuous improvement to be more resilient to modern slavery and the focus this in 2022 will be on implementing and incentivising responsible business practices to protect workers in our supply chains. This will be achieved by using the Government guidance as part modern slavery due diligence checks for both new and existing suppliers. 




Diversity and Inclusion policy
            

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that we realise our ambition to create an inclusive culture and work environment, where everyone feels that they can be themselves and are valued for the difference that they bring.
This furthers our commitment to having a diverse and representative workforce, alongside ensuring that our actions demonstrate a zero-tolerance approach to inappropriate behaviour and unequal treatment and where it is safe to challenge at all levels. 




Code of Business Conduct
            

The Code of Business Conduct fulfils the dual role of protecting our interests and protecting staff from any possible accusation that they have not acted properly. All employees and all staff are provided with a copy of this document and, where necessary, can refer to the detailed provisions.
This Code makes clear the duties and obligations of all staff. It outlines the support available in NHS Digital to protect staff from accusations of inappropriate conduct in carrying out their work. It sets the boundaries of acceptable business conduct and behaviour. 




Review of effectiveness
            

Our goals for the next financial year form part of our efforts to continuously improve how we protect workers from exploitation. In line with our commitment to comply with the Governments commercial policy and standards, we will put in place appropriate measures to do this effectively.
To achieve this, in 2022/23 we will:

apply effective and strengthened ongoing contract management and quality assurance through collaborative engagement with suppliers to assess risks during selection and approvals processes and put mitigation plans in place if red flags are raised, including monitoring and audits throughout the commercial life cycle
require suppliers to evidence strong social values by including social value evaluation criteria (where relevant and proportionate) to achieve improved social value awareness and compliance across all our activities
continue to support our staff to understand what steps they should be taking to prevent modern slavery, including increasing awareness of reporting mechanisms for raising concerns and focus ongoing efforts in delivering/making available appropriate annual training to our procurement and commercial staff, to build their capability to identify and address modern slavery risks; and
strengthen our risk identification and due diligence measures by mandating, where appropriate, suppliers to complete the Modern Slavery Assessment Tool                           
 




Adoption of statement
            

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and applies to NHS Digital. The Board approved this statement at its meeting on 8 June 2022.

This website undergoes automated testing against the W3C WAIusing the automated  tool weekly.This tool scans 100% of our web pages, and tests against all the criteria in the guidelines which are possible to automate.
The weekly report is reviewed by the website development team, with any actions taken and prioritised into our future work.We aim to fix all high priority issues with one week of them being identified.
In addition, we conduct internal testing against known accessibility issues which are not able to be found through automated testing, on a sampled basis.We last conducted an accessibility check on these areas in August 2020.  

























                            About this chart
                    


This chart shows the compliance as measured by our automated testing tool, Sitemorse against the A, AA, and AAA standards of the WCAG 2.1 specification.
Each standard has its own points of compliance, so those scores are shown separately.
However, you cannot claim a higher standard if you do not meet the lower ones, which means that the number of pages meeting AA or AAA is limited to the number of pages also passing the A standard. 















                            What automated testing tells us
                    


We use automated testing to drive most of our improvements to accessibility on the site. 
Automated testing can't find everything that could be improved, but is rarely wrong about what it does find.
This means we have fixed tens of thousands of accessibility problems which manual checking would have missed.
We do also undertake manual testing, including testing with real users with accessibility needs. We follow best practice across the industry, and try to keep up with the latest techniques for making our site accessible. 















                            Accessible features we test manually
                    


There are a number of accessibility features which we test manually, which include:

, which is done at design stage by using tools to check we meet the AAA standard of a 
, which feature across the site
suitability for , including aiming for areading age of 12
manual check against the W3C validator
ensuring that page elements render correctly at all sizes, including when zoomed to 500%
assessing content for readability using a mixture of tools which use mathematical methods to assess readability, and manual expert checking
checks of colour contrast
examining  markup and alt text using special tools
checking content in a text-only browser
using screen readers to read text aloud
using disability simulation tools to browse the website
 






What we are doing to improve
            

We are actively looking to improve the accessibility on our website.
