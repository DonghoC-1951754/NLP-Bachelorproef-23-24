a secure, sovereign system of data sharing in which all participants can realize the full value of their data.

The International Data Spaces (IDS) initiative aims at cross-sectoral data sovereignty and data interoperability. It sets forth a Reference Architecture
Model basing on open standards and contributing to global standards. By specifying data usage constraints, it defines the terms and conditions for
the data economy and by describing an open software architecture and publishing open source software codes it ensures maximum adoption.

IDSA is also an integral part of GAIA-X which is aiming at a Federated Data Infrastructure for European ecosystems.

IDSA is offering the following:
 Contribute knowledge and technology to the envisaged high impact project on European data spaces;
 Provide data infrastructure services to the operations of the nine European data spaces through its support organization;
 Provide advisory, knowledge and expertise to the European Data Act
 Provide a community of practice and a network of hubs and collaborations to support knowledge sharing and build up required skills in the data economy across Europe and beyond European borders.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Our mission and vision

IDSA is on a mission to create a digital future in which all players can realize the full value of their data through equal access to secure and sovereign data sharing among trusted partners.









Our mission and vision

It is time to change the way data is shared. We want to pave the way for a data economy in which every company and every person keeps full control over their data treasures. We believe in a data economy in which you do not rely on a solution that is owned by one big player. This is why we create the required standards for data spaces which grant data sovereignty to all participants to share data without regret.
Our mission is to advance the IDS standard and drive innovation, awareness and global adoption of data spaces to ensure data sovereignty, meaning staying in control of access and usage of your data, for all participants.







Data Sovereignty

IDSA aims toenable people, organizations, and governments to have control over their data, including collecting, storing, sharing, and use. This means making rules for data sharing and use, like data policies and contracts, with varying levels of control. We call thisdata sovereignty. IDSA offers guidelines and a framework for ensuring data sovereignty in data spaces.















Data Spaces

Our vision depends ondata spaces  which comprise relationships between trusted partners that are governed by IDSA standards for secure and sovereign data sharing, certification and governance for business and industry across Europe and around the world.










International standards
We aim to create international standards for data spaces, as well as fostering technologies and business models that will drive the data economy.Our standardization efforts are fueled by the IDSA members and technical staffs commitment, who actively shape and lead the development of data spaces. Central to these efforts are the IDS Reference Architecture Model, the IDSA Rulebook, and the Dataspace Protocol.















IDSA is transforming the data economy and realizes its promises, advocating for a world where every individual and organization retains control over their data. Our goal is to drive innovation, awareness, and global adoption of International Data Spaces (IDS), creating guidelines that guarantee data sovereignty for all participants.

Data Sovereignty

Youdecide howyour data gets used!

What is data sovereignty? Today, organizations of all types and sizes collect and store huge amounts of every kind of data. IDSA enables you to self-determine how and when others may use it across the value chain. We call this data sovereignty.















Why does this matter?








Control over data
Data sovereignty ensures that organizations, governments, and individuals have control over their data. This control allows them to self-determine how their data is collected, stored, shared, and used by others. Data sovereignty is a spectrum; its about finding the right balance between keeping data safe and sharing it to gain added value.











Innovation and trust
In a data-driven economy, trust is essential for fostering innovation and encouraging participation in data-sharing ecosystems. By establishing data sovereignty and enforcing rules for data management, such as data usage policies and contracts, organizations can create an environment of trust and reliability. When participants feel confident that their data is handled securely and self-determined, they are more likely to engage in collaborative initiatives, leading to innovation, knowledge sharing, and economic growth.











Interoperability and collaboration
Data sovereignty promotes interoperability among participants in data spaces. By adhering to common technical standards, organizations can share data seamlessly and collaborate effectively across different platforms and domains. The growing number of industrial cloud platforms and the heterogeneity of the platform landscape underscore the need for data sovereignty standards to ensure secure and trusted data exchange between different platforms.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Data Spaces

Where the future of data happens

Our vision depends on data spaces which comprise relationships between trusted partners that are governed by the IDSA standard for secure and sovereign data exchange, certification and governance for business and industry across Europe and around the world.





The basis for fruitful collaboration

Companies hold vast amounts of valuable data that they have been unable to safeguard, share or monetize. The IDSA standard enables data sharing through data spaces characterized by uniform rules, certified data providers and recipients and trust among partners. Data spaces provide the basis for fruitful cooperation, lowered barriers to entry and limitless innovation in the data economy of the future.
That future truly arrives when more companies implement IDS as their preferred mode of data exchange and when official standards and governance bodies adopt it as the binding global standard.

International Standards

Worldwide access, European principles

Our vision for shaping the future data economy requires international standards for data spaces. Such standards are crucial for enabling sovereign and trustworthy data sharing, as demanded by European stakeholders, and are essential for ensuring interoperability across the global landscape.





Standardization  the key to interoperability

Standardization is crucial for global exchange because it enables interoperability, reduces technical barriers, and enhances trade. It helps businesses reduce costs, enter global markets, and ensure quality products for consumers. It facilitates innovation, minimizes R&D risks, and supports environmental protection. Additionally, it allows companies to influence regulations and stay competitive by adapting to market trends.
Given the established position of IDS as de facto standards, it is vital to improve go-to-market strategies and increase maturity by aligning IDSA assets with relevant standardization bodies.
This effort is at the forefront of everything we do at IDSA. Our members, the IDSA working groups and the standardization coordination group, as well as the IDSA technical team, work diligently with key bodies at ISO, CEN/CENELEC and W3C and advise the European Commission on advancing global standards for data spaces.








IDSA engagement in European and International Standardization bodies






How it all comes together

Our standardization efforts are fueled by the IDSA members and technical staffs commitment, who actively participate in standards committees to shape and lead the development of data spaces. Central to these efforts are the IDS Reference Architecture Model, the IDSA Rulebook, and the Dataspace Protocol, which are key in setting technical specifications and fostering interoperability.

Eclipse Foundation  new working group on data spaces

In collaboration with the Eclipse Foundation, weve launched the Eclipse Dataspace Working Group (EDWG) to spearhead the creation of open-source software, components and specifications for data spaces. This partnership accelerates the development of the Dataspace Protocol (DSP), aiming to establish it as an ISO Standard and enhance global data sharing and sovereignty. The EDWG aligns technical efforts with universal standards, leveraging global developer networks to ensure interoperability and trust in data spaces.

ISO, IEEE, CEN/CENELEC  international & European standardization activities

On the international front, initiatives like IEEE P3800 and various ISO JTC1 activities underscore the growing importance of data spaces in global standardization, requiring collaboration across sectors. In Europe, the focus is on aligning with regulations such as the Digital Markets Act and the Data Governance Act, with collaborative efforts in CEN/CENELEC addressing the regions specific needs through initiatives like the Data, Dataspaces, Cloud and Edge Focus Group, aiming to harmonize standards across the digital economy.

European Commission  regulation state of the art

The European Commission (EC), through the Multi-Stakeholder Platform on ICT Standardization and the Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC), works to align EU policy priorities with standardization efforts. IDSAs contributions to data interoperability and the Dataspace Protocol are integrated into broader regulatory and standardization frameworks.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Working Group Rulebook
TheIDSA Rulebook serves multiple purposes that are instrumental in shaping how sovereign data sharing in data spaces work. At its core, it provides a clear understanding of mandatory rules and optional guidelines, encompassing functional, technical, operational, and legal dimensions for data sharing. This governance framework lays down guidelines for common service functionalities, defining processes, and outlining specific roles and services within data spaces.





Activities of the working group
The IDSA Rulebook working group is responsible for creating and maintaining the IDSA Rulebook, which addresses all relevant aspects of secure, fair, and trustworthy cross-organizational data sharing. This encompasses data spaces within specific sectors as well as across various industries.
The working group takes the lead in discussing mandatory and optional elements within data spaces and continually improves guidelines concerning their development and operation. This is done through close collaboration with other IDSA Working Groups and Task Forces.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Communities

The industries of tomorrow: IDS communities

International data spaces work across all industries and domains of activity. To that end, technologies, methods, organizational concepts and governance structures must be designed generically, to work with all. At the same time, IDS concepts must be adaptable to important cross-sector domains of activity that have specific requirements. Thats where IDS Communities come in.





IDS Communities are aligning tomorrows data solutions with common business needs

There are currently four IDS Communities, consisting of relevant stakeholders from industry, research and government, that are developing blueprints for data sovereignty inthe areas of mobility, industry, logistics and medicine.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Liaisons

Connecting the dots

Major digital initiatives around the world are working with IDSA to connect IDS concepts and standards with broad-based national and industry digital strategies, business needs and specific applications.





What our liaisons do

Industries need to agree on functions and interfaces for platforms, reference architectures and interaction protocols that have the potential to create markets and opportunities for the data economy of the future. This is not only true for the manufacturing sector but also for agriculture, healthcare, energy, public administration, municipalities and much more.
Our liaisons are partner organizations and initiatives with whom we collaborate to align our common work, share best practices and support each other in standardization activities. Some companies are members of multiple initiatives, so there is strong demand and support for the alignment of these approaches. Find out more about them below.


Big Data Value Association (BDVA)
BDVA is an industry-driven, international, not-for-profit organization that is working with IDSA to enable a European solution for Big Data and the AI-driven data economy. BDVA offers expertise and people who bring a functional point of view to the table, complementing IDSAs international approach and expertise in data sharing in a data economy. The liaison relationship has the potential to help build an onboarding community, enabling users to implement IDS components in an ecosystem of trust, and integrate BD/AI applications and platforms into the ecosystem to deliver functionality to potential customers.

Data Intelligence Offensive  (DIO)
The Data Intelligence Offensive is a cooperative platform of individuals, companies, organizations and public authorities to promote data management and the optimized use of technologies. The liaison with IDSA is based on our shared goal of a data economy based on trust and ethics; security and data sovereignty; data quality and interoperability; and establishing a cross-domain data ecosystem.

Data Sharing Coalition 
The Data Sharing Coalition is an open and growing international initiative that is working to unlock the value of cross-sectoral data sharing. The group aims to drive sovereign cross-sectoral data sharing by enabling interoperability between data-sharing initiatives and strengthening individual initiatives. IDSA is a founding member.

Data Society Alliance (DSA) / DATA-EX
The purpose of DSA is to set up technical and systematic environments so that users can easily judge, collect and utilize data that they seek.
The aim of the liaison relationship with IDSA is to focus on data quality for cross-company data exchange and on certification and architectures for data sharing. Part of that is to promote DATA-EX, a platform for cross-disciplinary data collaboration, that links existing data collaboration efforts.
Furthermore, IDSA and DSA will intensively consult on questions and developments with respect to data exchange, data catalogs and data marketplaces.

FIWARE
FIWARE is a curated framework of open-source platform components that can be assembled together with other third-party components to accelerate the development of smart solutions. The liaison between IDSA and FIWARE is designed to expand and actualize Europes focus on the secure and sovereign exchange of data between companies and organizations in a way that is agnostic with regard to technologies, platforms and vendors. IDSA is a member.

Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) 
The IIC is a global, non-profit partnership of industry, researchers and academics, bringing together the organizations and technologies to accelerate the growth of the industrial internet. Data is a key economic factor in the success of the industrial internet, making collaboration between the IIC and IDSA critical on standards and certification for data spaces. The IDS provides valuable resources for applications that are compliant with IICs reference architecture, and IIC helps extend the effectiveness of key aspects of IDS.

Industrial Valuechain Initiative (IVI)
The Industrial Valuechain Initiative is working to design a new society in which manufacturing and IT are integrated. The IVI is specifically concerned with the human factor and how manufacturing with people will change in the IoT era.
Industrial data sharing is key to a number of IVI initiatives, so alignment between IVI and IDSA concepts is critical. Although the two organizations approaches are not identical, they are complementary, and the in-depth analysis of data privacy and security elements by the IDSA enables the business-related considerations proposed by IVI.

iSHARE
iSHARE is a not-for-profit initiative that has developed a data sharing scheme to enable organizations to provide access to their data to other parties.
iSHARE focuses on defining data usage rules around identification, authorization and authentication. The basic principle underlying iSHARE, as it is for IDSA, is data sovereignty. Today, iSHARE implements legal contracts for the enforcement of the data usage terms.
iSHARE has been live since 2018, so its protocol can kick-start IDS implementations by specifying iSHARE as a trust option in order to achieve the first and conditional level of data sovereignty. This serves as a strong foundation for the market adoption of IDS. IDSA is a member.


OPC Foundation
OPC is the interoperability standard for the secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial automation space and other areas of industry. The OPC Foundation and IDSA work together to develop the infrastructure necessary for the two organizations to promote systemwide interoperability. The goal is to deploy an interoperability standard that is platform-independent and ensures the seamless flow of information among devices from multiple vendors.

Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international non-profit consortium aiming to make geospatial (location) information and data services FAIR  Finadable, Accessable, interoperable, Reusable.
The collaboration between OGC and IDSA aims to synchronize the activities of both organizations, fostering a collaborative environment for technical standards to seamlessly interoperate.This will be achieved in part through joint participation in potential future projects and initiatives, particularly in the areas of global supply chains, intelligent transport, and smart city data spaces.
The two organizations have already identified several ongoing or completed projects relevant to their work together, including:,,,&,,,, and others.

Robot Revolution & Industrial IoT Initiative (RRI)
The RRI is a private-led organizational platform to promote the Robot Revolution as described in The New Robot Strategy. This document defines robot as a system that executes tasks by using digital and network technology, advanced sensors, and artificial intelligence.
One of the organizations key goals is to use IoT technology to demonstrate the viability and commercial potential of the new robot age. The parallels and synergies with IDSA concepts are clear.

Real systems, real standards  connect to all the technical specifications for implementing IDS

Unlocking the power of data across the globe takes brains, and heres where youll find the brains of our operation. Next-level, federated data exchange ecosystem blueprint  check. Super-secure connector design  check. Rigorous, transparent certification process based on European values and standards  check. But dont take our word for it. Its all here so you can check









The IDS Reference Architecture Model

Data is rapidly becoming businesss most valuable asset  but it can only deliver on its full value when you put it into use and share it in ways that you, as the data provider, determine and control. International data spaces (IDS) are where this kind of trustworthy, self-determined exchange can happen, and our Reference Architecture Model (IDSRAM) sets the standard for building data-driven ecosystems, products and services. Heres where youll find everything you need to know to get started.







IDS reference testbed

The IDS concepts, architecture, and components form the standard for sovereign data sharing. To move from theory to practice and to achieve large-scale adoption, technical components must be tested for interoperability compliance. For this reason, we have created the IDS Reference Testbed.















Data connector report

The Data Connector Reportcomprehensively documents all existing implementations of data connectors and offers valuable information on their present state of development and usage.










Certification
Our goal is to establish international data spaces that guarantee data sovereignty and safe collaboration between partners. The foundation of IDS is trust, which must be established through a rigorous, transparent certification process. Find out more here.















Our keyword is data sovereigntythe IDS architecture ensures data sovereignty for those who make data available in data ecosystems. This means that data providers always keep control. They decide who uses their data for how long, for which application and according to which terms & conditions.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Reference Architecture

Lets Get Real: The IDS Reference Architecture Model

Data is rapidly becoming businesss most valuable asset  but it can only deliver on its full value when you put it into use and share it in ways that you, as the data provider, determine and control. International data spaces (IDS) are where this kind of trustworthy, self-determined exchange can happen, and our Reference Architecture Model (IDS-RAM) sets the standard for building data-driven ecosystems, products and services. Heres where youll find everything you need to know to get started.





Data is your most valuable asset

Data will increasingly be a key source of competitive advantageforthe future ofglobal business  but only if you can share it securely while confidently self-determining how it can be used. Data spaces are where this kind of secure exchange can happen, and IDS-RAM sets the standard for building IDS ecosystems, products and services.
The IDS-RAM is the beating heart of the IDS  it comprises the standards for secure and sovereign data exchange, certification and governance for across Europe and around the world.

What is the IDS-RAM?

To build the IDS Reference Architecture Model, companies collaborated with scientists, technologists and policymakers. The result is a conceptual framework for designing and implementing IDS-compliant data spaces.It defines the key components, their interactions, and the principles that govern the architecture of an IDS data space.











Role model
Role model: IDS-RAM serves as a practical blueprint, but also as an exemplar of the ethical and design principles that well ensure trustworthiness in data exchange and true data sovereignty in the data economy of the future.






Data sovereignty
Data sovereignty: in the open, federated data marketplace we envision, the IDS-RAM enables self-determination and control over data usage to remain in the hands of those who collect, store and provide it, rather than passing to large data exchange platforms and others, as is often the case today.






Information model
The IDS-RAMs information model is open, agnostic with regard to technologies and domains. This approach enables data exchange within a trusted ecosystem while preserving data sovereignty. The information model enables the comprehensive description of data assets and interoperability required for this kind of exchange.






Usage policy enforcement
The IDS-RAM provides a framework for technically enforced agreements for data sharing in addition to existing, legally binding contracts. This serves to underwrite trust in the system.












The working version of the IDS-RAM 4.0 is available on GitHub. Whether you have a question, want to request a change, or contribute to the text: Just join IDSA on GitHub.











Next version of the IDS Reference Architecture Model: RAM 5

We have started working on the next version of the IDS-RAM, which will be more modular and flexible, providing architectural guidance and support for building a dataspace, participating in one, or providing vale added data space services. RAM 5 will be aligned with the latest developments in IDSA and Data Spaces.








Aligned
RAM 5 is aligned with the latest developments in the Dataspace protocol, IDSA Rulebook, DSSC blueprint and more.







Decentralized
RAM 5 includes all variants of data space authorities: centralized, federated/distributed, decentralized, e.g. in the trust framework.







Diverse
RAM 5 provides architectural guidance for all roles in data spaces: Data space authorities, participants, service providers.







Modular
RAM 5 will have a modular approach instead of a linear approach for structuring the five layers and three perspectives.

Dataspace Protocol overview

Advancing interoperability:the Dataspace Protocol

The Dataspace Protocol is at the very core of the technical implementation of every data space component and guarantees interoperability between components and data space participants.





What is the Dataspace Protocol

Are you familiar with the Internet Protocol? At some point, everyone agreed on the HTTP standard to transport data between a web server and a browser. Now, picture a similar need for data spacesa universal protocol that doesnt favor specific business models or technical components.
Enter the . This detailed set of rules is designed to facilitate seamless data sharing between data space components and participants. The Dataspace Protocol ensures trust and interoperability, defining the needed schemas and protocols for cataloging data, negotiating contracts and usage agreements within a data space.
Organizations using this protocol can align with industry standards, foster best practices, and unlock new data-driven business models and opportunities.










is version () of the Dataspace Protocol specification is the release candidate and considered to be stable. Further changes shall not affect conformity. Since  the specification is stable with changes in details.
The user-friendly version of the Dataspace Protocol is accessible in the IDSA Knowledge Base.







For the version history and changes, refer to the GitHub Repository.












Relation to the IDS-RAM
The  provides guidance on implementing functional requirements and design choices for components within a data space, guaranteeing essential data sovereignty for reliable data exchange.
The Dataspace Protocol effectively puts into practice the principles and guidelines outlined in the IDS-RAM. It sets forth technical specifications and mechanisms for standardized , ensuring consistent interactions among components. This promotes interoperability and maintains data sovereignty within data spaces.






Relation to the IDSA Rulebook
In the , IDSA describes at an organizational level the interaction of roles and components in a data space, which create the foundation for trust and core functions of a data space. It clarifies the business level structures and processes of a data space.
The Dataspace Protocol provides the  to implement the compliance, trust, and security measures dictated by the IDSA Rulebook, ensuring that data transactions adhere to the standards and policies detailed in IDSA Rulebook.






Relation to standardization
The Dataspace Protocol provides a standardized set of rules and formats for data exchange. This is necessary for interoperability, allowing different systems and organizations to communicate in a seamless way.
As part of IDSAs goal to establish the Dataspace Protocol as an ISO standard, plans are underway to integrate the specification document IDSA has created for the Dataspace Protocol with a compatibility kit  an essential software component, crafted by the developer community.
This integration is set to take place within the .








Why we need the Dataspace Protocol

When organizations or companies want to share data, they need to provide details about the data to enable its transfer. The Dataspace Protocol explains how this information is provided:



It outlines how  are presented as  and how rules about data usage are expressed.
It defines how  governing data usage are written and negotiated electronically.
It explains how datasets are accessed using specific protocols.



The interactions within a data space involve , which implement the described protocols. While most interactions occur between data connectors, some involve other systems. An identity provider validates the identity of a connector, with its structure and content varying between different data spaces.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Certification

Certification: the basis of trust

How can you gain from your valuable data?  by sharing it with others in trustworthy partnerships. These partnerships are based on data spaces. It is therefore our goal to establish data spaces that guarantee a safe collaboration between partners.







Entrusting data to IDS

The foundation of IDS is trust, which is established through a rigorous, transparent certification process. The most important component of a data space is the IDS Connector. To make sure that each IDS Connector behaves as it should, it is certified against specific security standards and so is any participant in data sharing. On this basis of trust the participants can start their actual exchange of data.






Transparency through clear processes

For the certification of participants and components, we are using a certification scheme which defines the rules, and standards of the certification process. The IDS certification scheme follows best practices from internationally accredited certification concepts.


a











Two complementary types of certification

IDS certification has two parts: First, you prove that the IDS component you are using is built correctly. Second, you need to make sure your IDS components operational environment is supporting data sharing according to the requirements and rules. While the certification of your operational environment focuses on security and trust, the component certification also ensures interoperability.











Core component certification
Here we evaluate and certify the core components of IDS. Do they provide the required functionality and security?




a











Operational environment certification
This evaluation provides an assessment of the trustworthiness of the physical environment, defined processes, and organizational rules.




a


























There are two assurance levels available
Different companies and organizations have different data sharing needs, timelines, and budgets. For that reason, we offer two types of assessments to allow for more flexibility. Have a look at the first and simpler one below to the left and see a more complex variant below to the right.






a















The assurance level 1 checklist approach covers basic requirements for taking part in IDS. It allows you to prove that your IDS Connector is not only interoperable with any other connector in a data space but also complies with the IDS Reference Architecture Model. It is prepared by yourself and focuses on basic implementation but also on efficient, non-bureaucratic processes.



Before starting the assessment, your component needs to go through the IDS reference testbed
The assessment is based on a questionnaire, which can be accessed via the IDS Certification portal
Youll receive your certificate after youve filled in the questionnaire, uploaded the testing log files to the portal and have been assessed based on that information



The checklist approach certification generates significant value for companies; it is the beginning of a journey towards trustworthy and interoperable data spaces to grow your business.







All IDS components must meet a list of certification criteria to prove the provision of the required functionality, interoperability, and level of security.


a










The IDS assurance level 2 concept review certification is a wonderful way to show your partners in data sharing that you are committed to giving them the highest level of trust. It is proof that your IDS component complies with all requirements in terms of functionality and security. The concept review certification is performed by an independent third party: the IDS evaluation facilities. All IDS evaluation facilities must go through an extensive approval process for added security.
The external concept review includes the examination of documentation as well as the practical testing of the Connector, to ensure the correct implementation of the functional and security requirements. IDS Assurance Level 2 strikes the right balance between an independent review and the corresponding costs. This level can be combined with all three trust levels.
Receiving the third-party IDS certificatedemonstrates:



 comprehensive reviews and testing
 independent validation
 credibility by data sharing partners










All IDS components must meet a list of certification criteria to prove the provision of the required functionality, interoperability, and level of security.

The self-assessment covers basic requirements for taking part in IDS. This allows smaller companies to clear the first hurdle to IDS Certification and try out data spaces participation. It is prepared by yourself and focuses on basic but also on efficient, non-bureaucratic processes



The assessment itself is based on a questionnaire, which can be accessed via the IDS Certification portal.
Youll receive your certificate after youve filled in the questionnaire and have been assessed based on that information

IDS evaluation facilities

IDSA implementations should be reliable and robust. To this end, data sharing between certified entities using certified core components is encouraged. IDS evaluation facilities are accredited laboratories for validating IDS components according to standards formulated by IDSA.
The evaluation facilities independently oversee the validation of commercial IDS components developed by companies in various industries. They are also responsible for preparing the corresponding evaluation report, which is sent to IDSA for subsequent certification.

IDS certification scheme

Any organization or individual seeking permission to operate components in the International Data Spaces needs to pass the Operational Environment Certification which ensures secure processes and management of components.
Comparably, each IDS component is expected to behave in adherence with IDS specifications and to protect the data which is transferred and processed. It shall allow participants to assess the possible consequences of data sharing and provide transparent information. Therefore, components need to pass the Component Certification before they may be used in the IDS.
While the certification of organizations and individuals focuses on security and trust, the certification of components additionally refers to compliance with technical requirements ensuring interoperability.To ensure a consistent process in the certification of participants and core components, the IDS uses a certification scheme comprising all processes, rules, and standards governing the certification process. The IDS Certification Scheme follows best practices from internationally recognized certification concepts.










IDS Certification is described in the IDS Reference Architecture Model (IDS-RAM), a practitioner-oriented guide to designing and implementing architectures for data spaces.









Roles in IDS Certification

The realization of the IDS certification scheme requires different roles responsible for different tasks:

applicants,
evaluation facilities, and
certification body


Certification body
The certification body oversees the certification process regarding quality assurance and framework governance. It defines standard evaluation procedures and supervises the actions of the evaluation facilities. A certificate is granted only if both, the evaluation facility, and the certification body have concluded that all preconditions for certification are fulfilled.

Evaluation facility
Contracted by an applicant, the evaluation facility is responsible for carrying out the detailed technical and/or organizational evaluation work during a certification process. The evaluation facility issues an evaluation report for the respective organization/individual or core component, listing details regarding the evaluation process and an assessment whether all requirements are properly fulfilled.
The approval scheme for evaluation facilities can be found .

Applicant
The applicant is not just the subject of the evaluation and certification process but plays an active part in it. An applicant needs to actively apply to trigger the certification process. During the certification process, the Applicant provides all necessary material needed for the evaluation and certification of its component or organization and supports with questions or issues arising.






Certification process

The certification follows the same process for all certification profiles in operational environment and component certification. It consists of the following three phases:


Application Phase: The main goal of this stage is the successful start of the IDS evaluation and certification process.
Evaluation Phase: The main goal of this stage is the evaluation of an applicant or core component based on the defined evaluation criteria.
Certification Phase: The main goal of this stage is the examination of the evaluation report by the certification body, which issues a certificate if the result of the evaluation process is positive.

However, the details for each phase differ slightly between the assurance levels as described below.

Assurance Level 1
For Assurance Level 1, the applicant must apply directly to the certification body to trigger the start of the certification process.
Once the certification body accepts the application, the applicant is responsible for the evaluation phase by conducting a self-assessment and providing the results to the certification body. In the certification phase, the certification body reviews the self-assessment and issues the certificate, if the self-assessment meets the defined requirements.


Fig.: Certification Process for Assurance Level 1

Assurance Level 2 and 3
Assurance Level 2 and 3 require an independent evaluation facility to conduct the evaluation of the component or operational environment. The applicant must contract an evaluation facility. Together, applicant and evaluation facility finalize the application for certification with the certification body.
Afterwards, the evaluation facility is responsible for carrying out the evaluation according to the IDS certification scheme. The evaluation facility documents their progress and findings in an evaluation report which is passed on to the certification body at the end of the evaluation phase.
In the certification phase, the certification body examines the evaluation report and issues a certificate, if the evaluation was conducted properly and led to a positive evaluation result.






















IDS Certification criteria

IDS Certification ensures that IDS components and organizations or individuals who want to participate in data sharing meet the highest security standards.
These standards are industry-proven security criteria derived from ISO/IEC 27001 (international standard for information security management) and IEC 62443 (cybersecurity for operational technology in automation and control systems). In addition, IDS Certification implements security criteria defined in the Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue(C5) and the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix. Finally, IDS certification captures IDS specific criteria.
The certification criteria are defined in the IDS Certification criteria catalogs.






IDS Certification trust levels

IDS Certification ensures that IDS components and organizations or individuals who want to participate in data sharing provide a sufficiently high degree of trust and security. Nevertheless, the IDS Certification has a flexible setup and provides different levels of certification according to the intended use cases.
To ensure on the one hand a low entry barrier specifically suitable for SMEs and on the other hand a scalable certification to meet high information security requirements, three different security levels, with an increasing extent of the security requirements that need to be fulfilled, were defined:






Criteria for IDS Connector certification

Three different trust levels, with an increasing extent of the security requirements that need to be fulfilled, are defined:

Trust 1: offers basic security features to protect against attackers from outside, to ensure integrity and availability. It is therefore designed for use in scenarios with only low security requirements. A Connector meeting this profile is suitable for exchanging data with limited trust and security needs, for exchange of data in a contained environment or for demonstration purposes.
Trust 2: includes strict container isolation, integrity-protected logging, encryption of all persisted data, protection against accidental misuse by administrators. This profile is used for scenarios in which the protection of the processed and transmitted data is essential.
Trust 3: offers additional protection against misuse of privileged access, i.e., manipulation by administrators. This includes the protection against insider attacks as well as against external attackers who could gain privileged access. This is achieved by actively monitoring users and data on behalf of the data owner.


Criteria for IDS operational environment certification

The operational environment certification defines three different trust levels, with an increasing extent of the security requirements that need to be fulfilled:

Trust 1: covers only the basic security requirements that every participant of the International Data Space needs to fulfil. The entry level therefore serves as a low barrier for companies (especially SMEs) interested in trying out International Data Space participation.
Trust 2: covers additional security requirements, ensuring an advanced level of security. This level is suit-able for most core participants.
Trust 3: includes special security requirements that are necessary for International Data Space participants providing key services within the Inter-national Data Space.

Component certification

Trustful cross-company data exchange requires secure soft- and hardware components. All IDS components must meet a list of certification criteria to prove the provision of the required functionality, interoperability, and level of security. The evaluation of these certification criteria is conducted in the IDS core component certification.
Component assurance levels:
The depth and rigor of a component evaluation consists of the following three assurance levels, independent on the type of component that is being certified:

Assurance Level 1: Checklist self-assessment and automated interoperability testing
Assurance Level 2: External concept review including functional and security testing
Assurance Level 3: External evaluation including concept review, testing and source code audit

Connector trust levels
The criteria that make up each of the three trust levels for a Connector are defined in such a way that they are specific enough to ensure interoperability with the functional requirements of an IDS Connector, yet general enough, to allow the use of a Connector in different deployment scenarios without having to define different criteria catalogues for each separate use case.
The following three trust levels are defined for the certification of a Connector:

Trust Level 1: Data space interoperability
Trust Level 2: Feature complete for data usage control
Trust Level 3: Additional protection from internal attacks

The following figure illustrates all possible combinations of assurance and trust level, that an applicant can choose from.
This matrix approach allows the component developer to select a combination of assurance and trust level for their component that best correspond with the intended use cases.

On the one hand, this ensures a low entry barrier specifically suitable for SMEs. On the other hand, a scalable certification to meet high information security requirements becomes possible. purposes.

























Operational environment certification

Participants in the International Data Spaces share valuable data. It is essential that all participant's organizational processes and operational environments are trustworthy. This trustworthiness is evaluated in the IDS operational environment certification.
Central elements of the IDS operational environment certification are the different trust levels and assurance levels. The IDS established these levels to offer suitable certification profiles for different use case requirements.
On one side, the following three trust levels are established:

Trust level 1: Entry into data sharing
Trust level 2: Providing reliable services
Trust level 3: Offering trust-building services

Higher Trust Level represent the increasing number of criteria which needs to be fulfilled for a successful certification.
On the other side, the following three assurance levels are established:

Assurance level 1: Self-Assessment
Assurance level 2: External evaluation of corporate policies and processes
Assurance level 3: External audit of measures controlling the adherence to corporate policies

Higher assurance level represent the increasing demand for more reliable evidence that needs to be presented in different evaluation methods to prove compliance with the certification criteria.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

IDS Reference Testbed

Plug  Test  Go!

The IDS concepts, architecture, and components form the standard for sovereign data sharing. To move from theory to practice and to achieve large-scale adoption, technical components must be tested for interoperability compliance. For this reason, we have created the IDS Reference Testbed.





Make the grade!

The IDS reference testbed is an open-source setup with IDS components that has been jointly developed by the IDSA open-source community. The testbed will enable companies and organizations to develop IDS-compliant components and test them on their interoperability. It is also a preparatory tool for the IDS certification. 
Why is this important? The communal goal of the IDSA is to unleash the potential of the data economy through data sovereignty and trusted data sharing in data spaces. The testbed will enable the large-scale adoption of IDS components needed to bring this reality to fruition.














What are the advantages of the testbed?

Specifically, the testbed makes it possible to experience your components behavior in an IDS infrastructure in real-time. As such, it is the perfect way to put your use-case to the test and prepare your component for IDS certification. Plug-test-go. Its as simple as that.
The testbed is publicly available and contains the essential IDS infrastructure setup (CA, Daps, Meta Data Broker and connectors). Any company or organization that has developed IDS components can employ them in the testbed to check their interoperability and compliance with the IDS Standard





The IDS reference testbed: your first step towards the creation of data spaces.

VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Accelerating the adoption curve

The international data spaces (IDS) standard allows companies to implement the sovereign, secure data solution of the future right now. Heres how were helping everyone get on board.





Adoption is a process

Its a truism of technology innovation that the adoption of any new technology follows a path like this:








Gather knowledge and find your role
Get a better understanding of IDS core ideas and identify whether your company needs an IDS solution or aspires to support others in creating data spaces.








Create your data sharing use case 
Transform your business need into an IDS-based data sharing use case and connect with others to co-create or get support in your journey.








Build the necessary components for your use case  
Identify the specific components needed for your use case and get support to design and develop them.








Prepare for bringing your use case to life
Go through IDS certification and finalize the preparation of your components for getting into a data space.








Adoption

Collaborative Warranty and Quality Management
SAP | Fraunhofer
SAP wants to make use of IDS data sharing concepts to improve business processes by providing smart data apps which facilitate intercompany collaboration.
The example of the collaborative warranty and quality management apps illustrate how repair shops are incentivized to share vehicle quality data along the manufacturing supply chain, irrespective of their relevance for warranty claims. Suppliers of any tier gain transparency of quality issues from different downstream branches. When suppliers perform a root cause analysis of such quality issues, they can integrate downstream or upstream quality and usage data which is shared subject to usage policies.

Maritime Data Space
Sintef | Navtor | Neuron | Wilhelmsen | DNV-GL
CHALLENGE:
Maritime shipping companies are required by law to transmit a set of important data before entering every port. There are various industry solutions for this data exchange such as the Veracity ecosystem in the market today. All of them are very complex and time intensive to manage.
Providers and organizations on shore do not have access to ship data like emissions, fuel consumption and route details. Data access agreements between data providers such as ship owners, authorities or shipyard equippers as well as service providers that take care of for example data analysis and process improvements must be negotiated individually. A common ecosystem for data exchange from ship to shore , that simplifies the process and does not exist.
SUCCESS:
The IDS-based Maritime Data Space brings together all participants and platforms in one trusted and secure data ecosystem. It ensures transparent access to ship-related data, enables secure, stable and efficient communication between ship and shore, and provides value-added and trusted services for ship operations.
Autonomous shipping, environmental sustainability, industry 4.0 technologies, and the connection between ships are current trends that the Maritime Data Space addresses in an innovative way. The combination of the Norwegian DNV GL Veracity data platform with an IDS-based ecosystem strengthens Norways position in international maritime data exchange and sharing. Last but not least, the Maritime Data Space satisfies customer and regulatory demand for transparency.

Smart Connected Supplier Network - Market 4.0
TNO
CHALLENGE:
Smart Connected Supplier Network is an initiative of manufacturing companies and their IT-suppliers in the high-tech manufacturing supply chain. The aim is to facilitate cross-factory communication and thus ensuring supply chain transparency and interoperability, resulting in an overall productivity improvement of 20%. This is realized by reducing the administrative burden and facilitating collaboration between supply chain partners. Unlike traditional centralized platform initiatives, SCSN is fully based on the principles of digital and data sovereignty. There is no central entity controlling the data. A non-profit foundation chairs the data sharing agreements, but the implementation is done by the involved IT-suppliers. Unlike existing EDI-initiatives, these agreements not only address the semantics, but also the technical and legal aspects between partners in the ecosystem.
SUCCESS:
SCSN is designed as a highly scalable solution by providing a network approach (four-corner model) which consists of the following two aspects:

One common semantic language to exchange: orders, forecast, TPDs, BoM, drawings, invoices, logistical information, catalogues, and measurement data.
Seamless technical agreements between Service Providers to ensure the promise of Connecting Once - Communicate with everyone. The underlying SCSN infrastructure is based on the reference architecture developed by the International Data Spaces Association. The SCSN Foundation created standard IDS Connectors and Data Apps, which can be used by service providers. These service providers, i.e. integrator parties, created off-the-shelve integrations with a complete portfolio of ERP systems. This way, they can very easily connect manufacturing companies to the network.


BENEFITS:

Seamless scalable integrations for manufacturing companies for exchanging purchase-to-pay information
Reduction in administrative burden, faster time-to-market, lower IT integration costs
IT service providers only need a single integration

DASLOGIS - Dutch Data Spaces for Logistics
TNO | BIC | University of Twente | iSHARE Foundation | Emons Group |Dexes Data Exchange | Stichting ICTU | Transfides | Rojo Consultancy B.V. | Koninklijke KPN N.V. | IJssel Technologies | Marlin Supply Chain Connections B.V. | Visma Connect B.V. | 4PL Intermodal GmbH
CHALLENGE:
To adapt to changing market dynamics, organizations are collaborating more than ever in increasingly complex and agile supply chains, requiring a flexible exchange of many (often commercially sensitive) datasets with a variety of stakeholders.
Organizations in logistics are currently developing and implementing digitization strategies to adapt and prepare to extract value from these opportunities. However, the scale of the challenge transcends the boundaries of organizations. This project builds on the work and analysis of the needs, approach, positioning and roadmap for a Dutch logistics data space in the recently published white paper on the logistics infrastructure for data sharing.
SUCCESS:
Motivated because of conclusions from the white paper and previous research that there is a need for a Dutch Logistics Data Space (DLDS) that expands the limited functions of the current framework approaches for logistics agreements (such as iSHARE) and meets international developments and standards as also applicable in other sectors in the increasingly cross-sectoral and intertwined supply chains. That is why the DASLOGIS project aims to develop a DLDS: a digital virtual environment or ecosystem that enables the finding and controlled sharing of (potentially) sensitive data. It offers flexibility, extensibility, and personalization to support the three main types of logistics data exchange: "sharing transaction data for operational optimization," "sharing (big) data for data for data analysis," and "supply chain data sharing for real-time visibility."
DLDS will be based on the generic and internationally standardized IDS reference architecture model, supplemented and adapted to Dutch logistics needs where applicable. The Proof of Concept (PoC) of the DLDS is validated using three functional prototypes. The project partners will also demonstrate and assess the technical feasibility and business value of a DLDS for the Dutch logistics sector based on logistics use case.

Metal Domain Data Space - Market 4.0
Tecnalia | Ekin | Engineering | Exkal | Gepro Systems | Gizelis | Goialde | Intrasoft | Kleemann |LMS Lab of the University of Patras | Prima Industrie | Rico | TNO

CHALLENGE: 
Selecting the most suitable new manufacturing equipment is a time-consuming challenge for many customers. Theres no easy way to digest all available information about options, so customers must browse the internet, attend trade shows and talk to multiple experts in order to reach an informed decision. We wondered if data spaces could help integrate and streamline this process. We focused specifically on the metal domain.
SUCCESS:
The MARKET 4.0 Metal Domain Data Space is based on the IDS Reference Architecture Model (RAM). It describes a robust and efficient solution for linking the inventories of different equipment manufacturers to a MARKET 4.0 service that analyses the customers requirements and returns the most suitable equipment options for a certain metal domain manufacturing process. The connection is made through IDS connectors and the inventories and services include essential IDS modules (i.e., clearing house, metadata broker) that guarantee a trusted data exchange.

BENEFITS:

The MARKET 4.0 Metal Domain Data Space makes the selection of manufacturing equipment simpler and more efficient, getting to a better result in less time.
It is flexible and offers two solutions:

Connecting equipment manufacturer repositories with a single IDS connector. The equipment manufacturers do not require knowledge of the IDS RAM. Only the connector owner needs to have it.
Connecting one service with multiple data providers via IDS connectors. The benefit of this is that the data provider controls the data flow and is independent of the connector provider.

Smart Factory
VTT | Konecranes-Fastems-Danfoss
The Smart Factory is a step towards the Industry 4.0 vision for smart manufacturing where different machines interact with each other without, or with minimal, human control. The use case and involved IDS Solutions provide multiple benefits. For example, machines (and the companies that operate them) can better control with whom and what data is shared, and how data consumers handle the shared data. Moreover, IDS provides a systematic way to introduce new machines / companies into the factory and no case-by-case integration solutions are needed. With the IDS certification scheme, different stakeholders (both in-factory and external) can ensure that the utilized data exchange components address required security requirements. Finally, IDS brings improved interoperability across different data exchange protocols and formats, and data models.

BENEFITS:

Enhance trusted data sharing across factory borders facilitating e.g. the creation of digital twins
Enable interaction between machines and systems using different communication protocols (i.e. OPC-UA and non-OPC-UA)


COMPONENTS:


Connector  Is based on the Trusted Connector reference implementation and has been extended to support OPC-UA based data exchange. Enables machines to communicate with each other and also facilitates data exchange with external stakeholders.

The scenario for trusted data exchange for aeronautics includes data exchange between engineers, design and testing centres, and aviation companies across country borders. This means that different data protection laws apply. IDS connectors ensure that data can be managed in a safe and standardized manner, allowing for better condition monitoring and detection of anomalies for quality assurance. The connector development plays a crucial role in this scenario as cost reductions for quality assurance become possible. The implementation of the Data Sovereignty principles, following the International Data Space Association Reference Architecture Model, guarantees from on hand to control the access and the usage of data (cross-countries, cross-companies, etc.), on the other hand, the creation of an ecosystem ready to be extended to satisfy new needs and communicate with existing companies using a common vocabulary.

CHALLENGE:
Intelligent traffic and mobility systems require a large amount of data in order to support decisions in the best possible way or even to take them automatically. Although countless mobility data are already collected and processed today, comprehensive utilization of these data is often not possible for technical, legal or economic reasons. With the Mobility Data Space (MDS), an open IDS-based data space that goes beyond the secure exchange of sensitive mobility data, as well as linking existing data platforms with one another (cf. Mobility Data Marketplace  MDM). In this way, comprehensive mobility data can be made available in the future without worrying about misuse of data.
SUCCESS:
The MDS enables the sovereign handling of data for digital mobility solutions. Common legal frameworks based on European data protection guidelines form the basis for this.By linking offers from different mobility providers, individual mobility can be better combined with public transport offers and sharing providers. New possibilities also arise for traffic control by local authorities when data from private motor vehicles are combined with parking space utilization data and data from local public transport. Real-time information, for example, taking road works or traffic jams into account, allows flexible adjustment of routes for private and public transport vehicles. The perspective to be compliant with other data spaces that cover different domains create a whole new understanding of the mobility sector. The MDS will go live in the first half of 2022 as one of the first IDS-based data space operating at the market worldwide.

BENEFITS:

secures data sovereignty by establishing common rules for trustworthy data transactions

Fraunhofer IEE | Fraunhofer IWES | Fraunhofer ISST | Fraunhofer IOSB-INA | Fraunhofer IOSB-AST
CHALLENGE:
The digitization of theenergytransition aims to harness information froma large number ofdecentralized power generators. With the prospect of green hydrogen gaining importance in theenergysector, the sources of electricity supply for the electrolysis of hydrogenisimportant. Operation ofelectrolyzersneed to consider availability of green electricity, actual power prices and grid situation. In this use case wind power should be used for hydrogen production when the resource is available.
SUCCESS:
Communication between the plants and systems takes place via anEnergyData Space. Here, plants exchange data according to agreed rules and under certain conditions. An IDS connector implements these rules and processes. The concept of International Data Spaces thus enables all players to make self-determined decisions about the use of their data, thus enabling their digital sovereignty.
The turbine operator provides a data resource with operational data via an IDS connector. Anenergymanagement system from a third party provides the digital service to create an optimized schedule which is then sent to theelectrolyzerfor operation.

RealLab Hamburg
National Platform for the Future of Mobility (NPM) | 31 companies and organizations from Hamburg and the area
CHALLENGE:
To leverage the potential of intermodal travel, seamless integration of all mobility options in one user application is crucial. This application requires data interoperability and data sharing between multiple providers, such as different platforms and mobility providers, who have so far been reluctant to share their data, also for fear of competitive disadvantages.

Vehicle Charging
EDF
Electric Vehicles drivers can find charging their cars confusing and worrying:

Multiple smartphone apps/RFID cards needed to access different public charging networks
Varied pricing rates and structures
Limited interoperability of networks
Difficulty to plan long journeys across multiple networks
Users must plan their journeys more akin to that of a commuter using public transport.
Users can find charging points not working / already in use


All is exacerbated if a driver does not have a home charger or lives in an apartment block with no charging facilities (which is likely at the early stage of EV market development).

There are many data sources separately held that could unlock solution and value if they were aggregated and centralised for use and analysis. We propose to enhance roaming standards to allow operators to offer enhanced services that enable customers to freely move and charge between their home charger and partnering public charging networks, allowing a view of all of their EV fuel in one place.

BENEFITS:

This service will improve the EVs owner experience, by dematerializing the payment amd facilitating the planification of a long journey
It will enable real time connection with charging points (CP), in order to monitor CP availability and CP failures

Wind and Solar Assets modeling
EDF
When it comes to manage efficiently and effectively the renewable assets and all the O&M actions for the different actors (Manufacturers, Owners, Developers, Operators, ...), the difficulties to access to data exploitable in a cross functional way by these different profiles of actors and the different digital systems mobilized represents a real challenge.
The wind and solar description model is the digital backbone to federate all the businesses and its ecosystem around one single source of truth from DESIGN, MODIFICATION to others REFRESHMENT. This structured, agnostic asset management description support business process orchestration in a context of new business model refocused on growth of decentralized and distributed energy and carbon neutrality "as a service".
Being able to share the same abstract representation of data for the wind and solar domain would allow a better understanding of the associated operations (asset management, RCA, Structural Analysis, Visual Inspection, monitoring ...) and an obvious improvement of the processes that mobilize the processing of this information. It lays foundations of virtual plants.

Trusted Data Sharing in Smart Cities
VTT | Vastuu Group
Focusing on decision-making around transportation as an area of critical importance, we sought to build proof of concept for many-to-many connections that could be utilized in a smart city context. Our case involved two data lakes  one associated with energy use, the other with transportation and logistics. With the help of common design principles, ecosystem, a layered approach and building blocks, we were able to connect different parties together and make trusted and harmonized data sharing a reality. In this case, the result was improved information around decision-making for transportation, but it is easy to see how this generalizes to other smart city scenarios where acquiring and integrating different data sources enables better decision-making, innovation and new service creation.

Intelligent Washing Machine
Haier | Fraunhofer ISST

SOLUTION:

Through sensors within washing machines laundry data can be collected, which enables companies to offer their consumers a better utilization of washing machines with additional services. This data is sent to COSMOPlat for optimizing washing programs through ML. The optimized washing programs are sent back to the consumers washing machines to save energy, time, and costs, as well as it reduces the carbon footprint and will lead to longer lasting garments. By collecting consumer data companies get the possibility to gain data insights for product and service innovations. To make this use case concept feasible, IDS technologies need to be implemented, to reach data sovereignty. With the sovereign exchange of data, consumers are willing to share data with companies, as they are in full control over their data and can allow the usage of data only for specific purposes.

The ADVANEO DMP is a collaboration portal that enables the data-sovereign formation of Data Spaces for data-driven applications. Thereby, integrated AI tools, data models and applications as well as free access to millions of Open Data support the development of data-driven innovation projects. For this purpose, the ADVANEO DMP is based on the reference architecture of the International Data Space Association and in the future also the GAIA-X standards.As a result, the DMP acts as a broker service for data products: They are made globally discoverable by the marketplace with the help of their metadata. The DMP has no contact with the actual raw data at any time. These remain with the provider and are only transmitted directly to the interested party in peer-to-peer encrypted form by an IDS-Connector after successful license acquisition. If required, several parties process sensitive data in dedicated groups without access to the raw data of the other parties. Only the exploitation result is accessible to all. This enables the sharing of confidential data in value chains.

Light Commercial Vehicles
WITTE Automotive | Mercedes-Benz | truzzt dataspaces | PlanB | pi-lar
The key goal of the use case is the digitalization of the customary purpose of light commercial vehicles (LCV). This will include turning equipped LCV's into participants of an IDS-powered data-economy by leveraging available data from multiple source, execute pre-defined and use case-specific algorithms and offer the computed results back to the data economy. Parts of the solution will be: 1) Deliver an IDS-compliant control unit as edge device in light commercial vehicles and 2) orchestrate a data and application framework to download and execute use case-specific application on the edge device. IDS helps in two ways: enable an easy scalability across multiple data produces and data consumers in light of European data values (sovereignty, transparency, control).

BENEFITS:
As of today, connected commercial vehicles only focus on telemetry and environmental data. Our solution will allow commercial fleets to fully digitalize the LCV within its digital process chain.

Data Sharing Coalition - Green Loans
Data Sharing Coalition
In this use case, the consumer will be enabled to use their energy data to receive support with making their house more sustainable. This support can range from sustainability advice to a favourable Green Loan for investments in energy saving measures (e.g. heat pumps or solar cells). The consumer shares data on his or her energy consumption with an intermediary and/or loan provider, who in turn is able to assess potential savings from certain energy saving measures. This can be standalone advice but can also be incorporated in advice on a loan to finance these energy saving measures.

This use case gives the consumer more control over their energy data, as they can decide to use their data to access advice or attractive financial value propositions. With their new green loans and input for sustainability advice, financial institutes are able to support the transition to a more sustainable society.

Mobilithek
BMDV | BASt
CHALLENGE:
Digitization is driving new mobility concepts. Traffic and mobility data are becoming the raw material for multimodality, automated and connected driving, and other future solutions. The Mobilithek is right in the middle of the action.
SUCCESS:
Whenever you aim to provide or find high quality mobility data in Germany, you can hardly get around the Mobilithek. As neutral G2B and B2B platform the Mobilithek offers suppliers and users of mobility to share, search and subscribe to mobility-relevant online data.
With its defined standards for data exchange  among others based on IDS components  the Mobilithek offers nations biggest volume of information on traffic flows, traffic jams, road works, mobility options, parking facilities and more.
The Mobilithek is continuously working to make as much mobility data as possible accessible, across different means of transport, network elements and actors. This includes mobility data that is offered parallelly on other data portals in Germany, e.g. geoportal.de, mCLOUD.de, MDM, open-data-oepnv.de. Such parallel data offers will gradually be made visible on the Mobilithek as well. The evolution of the Mobilithek also will lead to an alignment with the Mobility Data Space (MDS) (link to previous posts) which will grant data sovereignty for Mobilithek users beyond the border of the platform and open up the entire Mobilithek to participants of MDS.

BENEFITS:

Better traffic management through exchange of traffic data between different road and infrastructure operators
Noticeable relief due to low organizational effort
High transparency and security through unified standards
High degree of dissemination of data in end-user devices through easy access for service providers
Improved business opportunities through easy access to the market for mobility data
New research impetus through broad, easily available data supply

Wrth C-Part Supply
Wrth
The transformation of the existing IT infrastructure to an event- and microservice-based software architecture involves a great deal of effort and also risks, since the transformation must take place in parallel with ongoing operations. The entire business logic (at least on the customer side) and thus the control of functions and processes must be mapped in microservices and orchestrated to form the overall service.

SOLUTION:

Moving to the technical platform considering the framework, rules and reference architectures of IDS, Gaia-X and Silicon Economy.
Successive implementation of individual icons in web services, initially on a Fraunhofer IML test infrastructure (Kubernetes cluster for orchestrating microservices encapsulated in application containers).
Implementation of a tool for the orchestration of web services control for the execution or support of logistical processes and services.
Acquiring and building own infrastructure or renting cloud infrastructure.


BENEFITS:
For Wrth, this presents an opportunity to install and establish a modern digital infrastructure with the corresponding services that will enable the future-proof, flexible, scalable and sustainable provision of services in the platform economy.

Many companies in the economy are facing a similar (technical) transformation step. Wrth can be a role model company here and offer a blueprint for other companies through the derived procedures for implementation, the experience with regard to challenges and best practice.

Defense Data Space
TNO | CGI | Department of Defense
CHALLENGE:
During deployments, it is critical that Defense can share critical up-to-date information with aid agencies, local authorities, and other civilian parties. However, these partners are not part of the secure defense network.FEDICE - an acronym for Federated Digital Collaboration Environment - ensures that Defense and its partners can continue to share information digitally in a simple, manageable, and secure way.
SUCCESS:
TNO and CGI have been working together for the Department of Defense on this NTP (National Technology Project) for the past two years. They have developed an intelligent platform for information management in federations. The platform enables rapid ad hoc collaboration with aid organizations and other partners while keeping the data at the source. FEDICE supports the sharing of information as needed.Throughout all of this, the confidentiality of information is taken into account to ensure that data does not get to the wrong places. In addition, logging makes it possible to track which data was released at what time and in which version. The prototype developed was successfully tested earlier this year during a large-scale exercise by the 13th Light Brigade of the Royal Netherlands Army. It has demonstrably made a good step from theory to practice.

BENEFITS:

Secure data exchange with non-military entities.

Charit | Siemens | Bundesdruckerei | 1&1 Ionos | SVA | polypoly | Vilua Healthcare | Medisana Space Technologies | Fraunhofer Gesellschaft | IDSA | Hasso-Plattner-Institut | OFFIS | Freie Universitt Berlin
CHALLENGE:
The health sector is highly regulated and health data is considered to be worthy of special protection. Most of the data from the first and second health domains are locked in proprietary systems that significantly hinder the pooling and secondary use of health data. In addition to a centrally controlled collection of health data, as in China, or a largely libertarian, economically designed consolidation along the lines of the U.S. model, there is scope for Europe to design a third path, that of a citizen-centered health data space. The strategic orientation of this concept is to place citizens at the center of the provision, use and control of their own health data from the primary and secondary health markets and thereby to expand Europe's differentiating competitive advantage. Health data will be integrated into a legitimate, open and supported dataLOFT platform and made accessible according to GAIA-X standards.
SUCCESS:
The goal is to develop transparent, cloud-based health applications with leading representatives of health IT and health care. The concepts of the Medical Informatics Initiative for semantic and syntactic interoperability and regulated data use, as well as legally binding Gema-tik standards and solutions of the telematics infrastructure will be integrated for the networking of the health sectors and the integrative use of the data. dataLOFT will create an ecosystem of health applications based on the data sovereignty of citizens and patients as users and donors of health data and thus contribute to a broad acceptance and high economic relevance of dataLOFT.

GAIA-X - MERLOT
imc | AWSI | edu-sense | HKA | HPI | IBM | IDSA | 1&1 Ionos | iServ | Schlerkarriere | TUK
CHALLENGE:
The digitization of education is intended to improve educational opportunities and make them fairer. However, in order to identify individual educational needs through algorithms, for example, extensive personal data requiring a high degree of protection (e.g., educational path, goals) is required, which must not be digitally processed because of threats to fundamental rights. The Corona Crisis urgently calls for a solution to this contradiction.
SUCCESS:
The goal of the project is to create specially protected educational data spaces, including services, which are available via marketplaces. To establish data sovereignty, the services will be certified according to their compliant data use and provision. Interoperability of these will be ensured by means of business model interfaces. Existing services will be brought into the project and adapted to conform to the marketplace and educational data space. The added value of the project and the underlying Gaia-x infrastructure will be demonstrated by means of several application examples. The implemented services will be linked to data-secure AI-supported digital assistants that support learners in a data-supervised manner in career orientation and career planning.

Wind Energy Generation Data Space
ATTEN2 | Tekniker
CHALLENGE:
A very important aspect of the competitiveness in the wind farms is the maintenance of all the components of the wind turbine. Only wind farm developers and wind turbine manufacturers (OEMs) have access to data collected from operating wind turbines and are therefore the only actors currently working on extracting added value from data at the "top of the value chain". Therefore, most European wind turbine component suppliers, engineering companies or ICT companies cannot obtain, manage, analyse, and learn from the data produced by wind turbines in operation, thus missing the opportunity to improve their competitiveness.
SUCCESS:
The use case shows how the adoption of the IDSA Architecture boost the exchange of the data monitored by the sensors installed in wind turbines, which belong to the wind farm owner and the OEM, with other interested third parties such as technology and component suppliers, as secure data exchange and data sovereignty is guaranteed.
Furthermore, it is also shown how this data sharing enables added value creation through information fusion. The deployment of the solution combines edge processing with the cloud demonstrating its applicability in wind turbine plants.

BENEFITS:

A deeper understanding of the technical characteristics and performance of the wind turbines' critical systems and components.
Developing a highly skilled and competitive supply chain
Less investment in data analysis systems thanks to the collaboration and support of specialized suppliers with in-depth knowledge of the technical characteristics and performance of the components supplied

City Dataspace
Wuppertal | Solingen | Remscheid | APTIV
CHALLENGE:
Smart cities are becoming more and more of a reality every day. While the first autonomous vehicles are making their way into cities on a trial basis, parking lots can already report whether they are occupied or free, sensors monitor air quality, and multimodal apps also enable people to get around using different mobility solutions. What all these applications have in common is that they are based on data generated and managed in different places by different actors. However, applications based on Open and Urban Data in particular have the disadvantage that they are either built specifically for exactly one city and then only work there or have to be adapted for other cities at great expense. The reason for this is that today's Open & Urban Data portals provide data sets in different formats, models and schemas. In addition to these syntactic differences, there are also semantic differences, such as different metrics or geo-reference systems. This is exactly what makes it costly for app developers to develop solutions that work outside of a municipality.

The City Dataspace focuses on the challenge of increasing and enabling the usability of Smart City relevant Open and Urban data using the example of mobility and geodata across municipal boundaries.
SUCCESS:
The City Dataspace aims to enable the data-driven smart city of tomorrow by enabling compatibility of heterogeneous open and urban data from different municipalities together with data from other stakeholders across city boundaries. For this purpose, the City Dataspace relies on the established semantic technologies, combined with new innovative concepts to simplify the use of the required technologies. These concepts are intended to make it possible to provide semantically annotated data in an interoperable way with little effort. This interoperability should enable app developers to develop an app once and roll it out to a large number of municipalities using the City Dataspace. Conversely, the City Dataspace enables municipalities to participate in existing apps just by making their data available. 

BENEFITS:
The City Dataspace aims to enable the data-driven smart city of tomorrow by enabling compatibility of heterogeneous open and urban data from different municipalities together with data from other stakeholders across city boundaries.

COMPONENTS:
The City Dataspace is a Knowledge Graph-based Data Management platform that allows access to batch and streaming data using different kinds of data connectors. As IDS components, the city data space will especially focus on using IDS Connectors and IDS Metadata Broker.

DataPorts
ITI | Traxens | PRODEVELOP | IBM Israel | OTE | Everis | UPV | ICCS | UDE | CERTH | Fraunhofer ISST | THPPA | Valenciaport Foundation
CHALLENGE:
Although many projects/initiatives have dealt and/or are dealing with developing data platforms architectures in diversified application domains, not many projects have addressed integration in port environments with the possibility of including cognitive services/applications and extending/federating the platform to whole transportation routes covering whole Europe. Lack of interoperable, scalable, reliable data platforms causes major technological and business issues such as the impossibility to plug non-interoperable data sources into heterogeneous data platforms, the impossibility to develop applications to exploit heterogeneous data in homogeneous and/or cross domains, slowness of data technology introduction at a large-scale, discouragement in adopting data sharing technology, increase of costs, scarce reusability of data, user dissatisfaction, and lack of unified data governance mechanisms.
SUCCESS:
DataPorts aims to design, develop, set-up and operate a data platform for the trusted, secure and reliable data sharing with IDS connectors and trading among the actors operating in the diverse supply chains involved in the seaports, also enabling the connection with other stakeholders in the logistics supply chain.

BENEFITS
The adoption and use of this Data Platform by existing connected / digital ports will imply their transition to actual cognitive ports, taking real advantage of the huge amount of data produced by the stakeholders and opening the way to new capabilities: Real-time control of operations; Streamlined decision making; Accurate prediction of future events and situations; Prescriptive analytics.

COMPONENTS
In the context of the DataPorts project, an industrial data platform (cognitive ports data platform) has been designed and implemented that: 1. Connects to different digital infrastructures currently existing in digital seaports, enabling the interconnection of a wide variety of systems into a tightly integrated ecosystem, 2. Sets the policies for a trusted and reliable data sharing and trading based on data owners rules and offering a clear value proposition, and 3. Leverages on the data collected to provide advanced data analytics services based on which the different actors in the port value chain cloud develop novel AI and cognitive applications. In the context of the DataPorts platform, to realize data sharing and data exchange, two main approaches are considered:  Data is stored off-chain: Generally, in this approach, we follow the concept of the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) reference architecture model. In a nutshell, we consider the P2P data exchange between the data owners and data consumers through the IDSA connectors. To ensure the security and privacy aspects, blockchain manages consent of access to data. Smart contracts decide if a particular access to data is allowed concerning the invokers credentials and the specification of access rules for the data.  Data is stored on-chain (blockchain for shared data): Blockchain platform records transactions related to shared data and processes of all participants in a business network. For instance, cold chains alarms of a container for verification of its state such as if conditions have been compromised, allows everybody in the network to be aware of the event and act upon it. This approach in fact ensures verifiable and immutable information on shared data through the entire chain to all business network participants, serving as a single source of truth and providing transparency and a not-repudiation process. In the first approach, the data (sovereign data) is kept on the owners premises. The metadata for sovereign data is published to the broker (IDSA broker). A data consumer needs to understand whether the data he seeks is a shared data stored in Blockchain or is stored by a data owner. To clarify this, the data consumer must access the IDSA broker, and in case the data is sovereign data, data sharing rules are used to determine if a data access is allowed. Eventually, in case of a legitimate data access, a peer-to-peer secure communication with data owner to obtain data is initialized through IDSA connectors.

H2 Metaverse
ARENA-INNOVATION | CODE_n
CHALLENGE:
The latest draft of the "Act to Accelerate the Use of Liquefied Natural Gas (Gesetzes zur Beschleunigung des Einsatzes verflssigten Erdgases) sees a significant change in reallocation of LNG import terminals for the import of hydrogen. In the draft, it is no longer mandatory that green hydrogen or its derivatives must replace the fossil fuel LNG. Now there is talk of "climate-neutral hydrogen and derivatives". This means that hydrogen based on natural gas, of which CO2 is fully captured and not released into the atmosphere can also be used. With blue hydrogen, the CO2 would be stored underground (CCS). In the case of turquoise hydrogen, it would be done using the  at large-scale not yet tested  methane pyrolysis converted into solid matter. In both cases it would have to be ensured that during extraction and transport of the natural gas no methane escapes. In theory, even hydrogen falls into this category, that would be produced by electrolysis using nuclear power.
SUCCESS:
A project draft (Projektskizze) has already been submitted to BMBF under the acronym "h2republic". The goal is that a new "H2 Data Space" for sovereign data exchange shall be created, which shall stand at the basis of the "H2 Metaverse" platform. Due to the technical complexity of the "H2 Data Space", it should remain hidden to the eye of the conventional "H2 Metaverse" platform user. Hence, the "H2 Data Space" shall be the interface to the programmers and smart service providers, whereas the "H2 Metaverse" shall be the interface to the conventional Fuel Cells and Hydrogen (FCH) players by using predefined smart services according to their requirements. Such smart federated services can/shall be the implementation of standardized Digital Twins for ensuring cross-sectoral interoperability along the entire value chain and for depicting the entire physical hydrogen world into the digital H2 Metaverse, which at the end should become a de-facto standard for the entire gas domain.

BENEFITS
Fuel Cells and Hydrogen (FCH) technologies are defined as sector coupling technologies for coupling the energy and mobility sector together. Hence, it is obvious, that the newly created "H2 Data Space" will link up the already existing energy and mobility data spaces and of course other as well. On the other hand, in order to ensure sovereign data exchange and interoperability, it will try to digitally interconnect all FCH clusters worldwide. In order to prevent lock-in effects, the H2 Metaverse shall not belong to one person or entity but to the whole users and be created by them while being at the same time free of charge. With regard to the business model, this shall be realized via company participation (Gesellschaftsbeteiligung) with all the 16 German states (Bundeslnder), similar to the already existing company participation of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg to the "mobility data space".

COMPONENTS:
The H2 Metaverse platform shall be similar to the Catena-X platform in terms of visibility. For this all the necessary IDS components, like for example the IDS/Eclipse Connector and so on shall be used.

Resilience and Sustainability Data Space
ADVANEO
CHALLENGE:
News about evolving or new global crises (e.g. pandemic, war, disasters) have become the new normal over the recent years. In our connected world, dampening their effects, adapting and becoming more resilient and thus sustainable, can be improved vastly, by building shared solutions along these connections. And the backbone of these connections is data. As prominent use cases the PAIRS-and the SPELL-Plattform will be part of the Resilience and Sustainability Dataspace. Especially the PAIRS-Plattform inside Resilience and Sustainability Data Space will allow for transparency of the supply chain by early identification of crisis and their effects on supply and production conditions for each individual participant. Furthermore the participants will be aided with iteratively improved recommendations for measures to manage the crisis effects on their organization.
But finding and using data in a sovereign way is a general core challenge in any data driven project.
So how can interested parties easily find services to become more resilient? How can they be sure that their data privacy and sovereignty is guaranteed in such an open ecosystem? And how can creators of such services find initial their initial partners and start building the required networks?

SUCCESS:
The answer to the above questions lies in established and independently certifiable standards for sovereign data sharing and the usage of services  like IDSA and GAIA-X. The Resilience and Sustainability Data Space is built on these standards.
These standards are built into a unified system, which enables offering, finding and accessing relevant data sources as well as resilient and sustainability services.
The IDS solution, especially the corresponding connectors, as basic technology inside the Resilience and Sustainability Dataspace facilitate the necessary sovereign data exchange.

BENEFITS
Companies and organizations as users of the Resilience and Sustainability Dataspace benefit from our data-based approach of a digital infrastructure to integrate decentralized information in a protected virtual space. With this infrastructure users are either able to apply already implemented services or to develop new services supporting our users in order to gain new insights and knowledge about. The variety of datasources which are part of the Resilience and Sustainability Dataspace also facilitates cross-over domain approaches for services as also will be implemented inside the PAIRS-Plattform. Especially the supply chain use case as a cross-over domain service utilizes the different data sources coming for different . By additional search and find functionalities inside the Resilience and Sustainability Dataspace partners can connect to build research projects, exchange in a sovereign way data and make use of the existing dataspace infrastructure. In the end, athis enables users to seamlessly build their own trustworthy resilience and sustainability ecosystems.

AluTrace
Fraunhofer EMI | Fraunhofer IWM | fem
CHALLENGE:
Due to the great freedom of design, additive manufacturing (AM) offers enormous potential for lightweight construction. In order to harness this potential, it is crucial to integrate knowledge between the individual stages of the AM value chain. By digitally linking AM process and product data, lightweight design and production can be further optimized in economic and ecological terms. The present use case demonstrates the added value for the lightweight potential of additively manufactured (laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)) aluminum components when decentralized material and AM process data is shared between actors via a cross-institutional data space.
In the present use case, a design engineer aims to optimize a component, originally manufactured by casting AlSi10Mg, with regard to lightweight design by means of topology optimization for AM. A process-specific topology optimization algorithm (PSTO) will provide an optimized design and also knowledge of the best suited combination of AM-machine, part orientation in build space and a heat treatment. As input for this design algorithm, decentralized data about mechanical material characteristics, AM process parameters and post-processing information such as heat or surface treatment has to be shared and linked in an automatic manner. Since the different data is provided by different actors, compliance with the FAIR data principles is paramount.
SUCCESS:
To meet this need, a data space architecture based on the International Data Spaces (IDS) reference architecture model is designed and implemented. By doing so, the very first instance of the Materials Data Space (MDS) is created. Using the MDS in this context ensures

findability (F) of the decentralized data and their owners through the use of a broker as a virtual marketplace,
secure and automated access (A) to the data from the IT infrastructures of the institutions,
interoperability (I) in data sharing with full guarantee of data sovereignty through the use of the IDS connectors, and
the reusability (R) of the data by the PSTO based on machine- and human-understandable metadata in the form of knowledge graphs.

The knowledge graphs describe the entire process chain from additive manufacturing to mechanical testing and embed the resulting data in its context through an ontology-based process model. These semantic metadata enable the linking of data in the sense of a cross-institutional data fabric and automated data analysis for intelligent lightweight design by the design engineer.

BENEFITS:

The lightweight potential of additively manufactured components can be optimally exploited through process-specific topology optimization.
The decentralized material, process and component data are semantically linked and shared in an automatic manner while maintaining the highest data sovereignty standards.
A scalable solution for the integration of data and analysis results from the data space into the design process of lightweight components is provided.
Detailed, diverse material, process and component data for AM lightweight materials are provided in a scalable data space architecture.
Tools for digital modelling of value chains and interoperable description of data and domain knowledge have been developed.

Macau-EU Cross-Border Flow of Scientific Research Data
Macau University of Science and Technology | Fraunhofer ISST
CHALLENGE:
The safe and orderly flow and governance of data has become a global issue, and the cross-border flow of data is one of the most complex sub-issue. At the outset, the existing international data cross-border flow mechanism is experiencing pressure from various aspects such as EU-US Privacy Shield Frameworks agreement overturned and Standard Contractual Clauses require additional supplementary measures, etc. Given the fact that data has become more and more important for the development of both economy and society at large, the investigation after the fact approach cannot meet the satisfaction of some countries or regions for security and management concerns. In addition, how the different requirements for data export in different jurisdictions apply to the same business brings huge problems to practice when data keeps flowing. In this case, Macau University of Science and Technology and the Fraunhofer ISST are respectively located in different jurisdictions. As a consequence, the cross-border flow of scientific research data involving personal information often arises in the scientific research cooperation activities between the two parties. If we transfer any kind of data in the multi-center joint scientific research activities, except for the traditional research ethics requirements, the two parties must also meet the requirements of their respective laws and regulations on the export of personal information.
SUCCESS:
In order to explore the mechanism for the safe and orderly flow of data across borders in the digital era, we can together establish a trinity of legal regulations + management mechanism + technical assurance model in the field of scientific research, covering the whole process of before, during and after course. 

BENEFITS:
This has not only mark the possible and trust way to realize the purpose of data cross-border issues that needed to be addressed, but also laid a solid foundation for the future exploration in regards to this area. It is also a great opportunity to promote the development and fame of IDS in Macau and Asia.

FAST ecosystem for I4.0-compliant and data-sovereign digital twins
Fraunhofer IOSB
CHALLENGE:
Due to the advancing digitalization of industrial value chain, increasingly large amounts of data are being generated in industry. Sharing data with partners in this domain, opens up new application and value propositions. This requires that the data can be interpreted across system and company boundaries, generally referred to as interoperability. The Platform Industry 4.0 proposes the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) specification for the digital represention of all assets. Additionally, the data security and data sovereignty challenges, which arise in such use-cases, are addressed by the IDS ecosystem.
SUCCESS:
By combining the AAS with the IDS, interoperability across company borders is created. Product and production data is represented in AAS digital twins and shared via IDS Connectors.

BENEFITS

CHALLENGE:
A sustainable design of the tourism landscape is indispensable for its long-term existence. The use of data makes it possible to scale tourism while taking sustainability aspsects into account. Thus, sharing data within the tourism sector, in addition to increasing value creation, enables the management of one of the most central problems of the 21st century - climate change.
SUCCESS:
The sustainable design of tomorrow's tourism is based on the exchange of data between different organisations. Accommodation providers, transport associations, lift operators, booking platforms, weather data providers and other stakeholders join forces and facilitate concrete use cases such as visitor flow management, prevention of overtourism or hotspot analyses. Furthermore, data from organisations within the tourism sector is of enormous value for other sectors, such as the energy sector or the mobility sector. The possibility to exchange data in a decentralised way while maintaining data sovereignty is a key enabling factor.

SCUNY (SChool UNited EconomY)
Orbiter
CHALLENGE:
SCUNY (School  UNited  EconomY) should become a community and networking platform that offers networking and collaboration opportunities for students and professionals from business, politics and social organizations. In addition to the search for cooperation in projects or 1:1 mentoring, potential analyses can be carried out and mutual learning nuggets can be deposited and expert insights can be planned and offered, in which students or experienced professionals share their knowledge. There are already many offerings (from organizations and also ideas from students), but the interface that unites everything is missing.
The issues of data protection, trust, traceability, transparency and security are cornerstones for the (technical) functioning of the project. Without all this, sharing and exchanging learning progress and documents is difficult, especially because parents demand a controlled space for their children to work and develop. It is necessary to think not only about what content and functions can look like, but also what it takes to protect them from misuse, theft and manipulation. Rules must be defined and technically implemented that everyone must adhere to. So far, there is no suitable approach to doing this adequately.
SUCCESS:
The truzzt box, which technically realizes IDS specifications, forms the central management and control body for digital life in the SCUNY use case. A virtual data container is provided for each party of the platform, which is in the full control of the owner and allows trustworthy and secure collaboration with other internal and external persons. Every transaction is transparently and traceably logged, data can be securely stored, provided with terms of use and shared. The user interface forms idento.one as an applicative layer and allows a maximum user experience. Partner integration is simplified thanks to IDS connectors.

BENEFITS:

Traceability and transparency based on a technical implemented IDS-based approach


COMPONENTS:

App Store
Agglomeration of services from a wide variety of (independent) service providers (schools, tutoring institutes, companies, etc.), combination with billing for secure and trusted transactions and transfer of e.g. payback coins

PLATOON: Wind Energy
Tecnalia | VUB | Engie | ENG | Fraunhofer | UDGA
CHALLENGE:
The goal of this pilot is to provide predictive maintenance of wind turbines with a focus on the generator and power converter, which can be applied to other pilots or use cases. However, nowadays, energy data does not generally comply with the FAIR principles. In fact, it is normally kept in silos within companies and it is hardly reused for other purposes than the ones initially conceived for. In addition, in certain cases access to data is limited to some influential big companies. This is a big innovation barrier for academia, RTOs and SMEs as they cannot leverage this data to develop new products and services. This situation around data is one of the main blockers for the energy transition.
SUCCESS:
IDS solutions are used as the basis of PLATOONs solution for data sharing. PLATOON leverages sovereign data sharing as an enabler to develop innovative data analytics tools by combining data from multiple stakeholders from the energy value chain to unlock new value and further optimise the energy sector. Furthermore, apart from sovereign data sharing PLATOON also considers sovereign exchange of services (data analytics tools) allowing data providers to access a wide ecosystem of service providers. These innovations will contribute to accelerate the energy transition to achieve the goals set in the Green Deal.

BENEFITS:
PLATOON developed wind turbine digital twin with accurate physical and data-driven digital twins and models (physics-based simulation model, supervised data-driven model and normal behaviour data-driven model) that provides anomaly detection and fault diagnosis and isolation. Several business models have been defined in PLATOON regarding data/service sharing. In a nutshell, data is considered as an exchange token to get access to improved products (e.g. Wind Turbine Components with extended lifetime and enhanced performance) or data analytics services (e.g. HVAC operation optimisation, predictive maintenance tools) that can further optimise the Operation and Maintenance Cost and Improve the efficiency across the whole energy value chain.

CHALLENGE:
This pilot focuses on optimization of energy management system and predictive maintenance on smart buildings. The goal is to offer a better service to customers by reducing energy bill, increasing RES usage and reducing maintenance costs and downtimes. These challenges and goals are shared in many smart building customers. However, nowadays, energy data does not generally comply with the FAIR principles. In fact, it is normally kept in silos within companies and it is hardly reused for other purposes than the ones initially conceived for. This is a big innovation barrier for academia, RTOs and SMEs as they cannot leverage this data to develop new products and services. This situation around data is one of the main blockers for the energy transition. Additionally, some specific applications cannot expose an external internet connection and/or require low latencies, which makes necessary to host the data operations into edge.
SUCCESS:
This use case can connect three different domains : Energy, Smart building and Smart city, which is fully in line with the objectives of common data space. IDS solutions used as the basis of PLATOONs solution for data sharing. PLATOON leverages sovereign data sharing as an enabler to develop innovative data analytics tools by combining data from multiple stakeholders from the energy value chain to unlock new value and further optimise the energy sector.

Sovity Data Space
Sintef | Navtor | Neuron | Wilhelmsen | DNV-GL
CHALLENGE:

Maritime shipping companies are required by law to transmit a set of important data before entering every port. There are various industry solutions for this data exchange such as the Veracity ecosystem in the market today. All of them are very complex and time intensive to manage.

Providers and organizations on shore do not have access to ship data like emissions, fuel consumption and route details. Data access agreements between data providers such as ship owners, authorities or shipyard equippers as well as service providers that take care of for example data analysis and process improvements must be negotiated individually. A common ecosystem for data exchange from ship to shore , that simplifies the process and does not exist.

SUCCESS:

The IDS-based Maritime Data Space brings together all participants and platforms in one trusted and secure data ecosystem. It ensures transparent access to ship-related data, enables secure, stable and efficient communication between ship and shore, and provides value-added and trusted services for ship operations.

Autonomous shipping, environmental sustainability, industry 4.0 technologies, and the connection between ships are current trends that the Maritime Data Space addresses in an innovative way. The combination of the Norwegian DNV GL Veracity data platform with an IDS-based ecosystem strengthens Norways position in international maritime data exchange and sharing. Last but not least, the Maritime Data Space satisfies customer and regulatory demand for transparency.

Cross-domain: Web 3.0 Data Space
Post-Platforms Sciences | Po Startinblox | Digita Digentity | SolidLab
CHALLENGE:
- Platforms quickly monopolize their market niches. There is almost no connection between different platforms and a serious vendor lock-in problem. They monetize the users' content, yet any account can be arbitrarily banned.
- These challenges are totally relevant for each and every industry:
- Museums suffer without proper intellectual property rights management and provenance tracking
- Enterprise sector suffocates under hundreds of different software systems and databases
- Hotels struggle to pay a 20% commission to booking platforms
- Traditional and social media promote lots of fake news, while fact-checking consumes huge resources
- Individuals dont really own and control even their healthcare and wellness data, spread across multiple platforms and systems
- Cadastre and tax authorities cannot properly harmonize their systems and databases, making citizens suffer
Etc.
SUCCESS:
The pool of billions of PODs for people, organizations, and things represents the Data Space itself. PODs are not interconnected among them. They are accessed only by and via platforms (we call them post-platforms).

Post-platforms get controlled access to PODs, read them and write back on them. Only authorized by the owners of PODs users get access to specific data on PODs, and it does not matter which platform they use. These post-platforms are not interconnected amongst them and they do not hold any original data, just cache copies.
Due to advanced security by design users have e-passports, issued by a developed public key infrastructure (PKI). With such e-passport, users can control their PODs, identify/authenticate themselves, get money from ATM, or open a hotel room. Users will not need logins/passwords anymore.

Personal PODs keep data created by their owner, but also public and third-party data, for example, Cadastre, police or municipality data, other authorities, healthcare records, data from schools and universities, etc.

BENEFITS:

The Web 3.0 Data Space concept makes the physical world intensely data-rich and merges online and offline interactions into a single yet fully decentralized metaverse.
Individual PODs keep all the information originated by a person via their online activities, including sent messages, posts, transactions, various files they created, etc.
The same storage also keeps track of all messages, comments, and reactions they or their content ever received.
Organizations and public authorities also record on the POD every piece of information about its owner's identity and legal liabilities, and this data cannot be changed or deleted by anyone but its authors. Every entity also stores all the information related to its business and legal interactions on its POD. Just like individual ones, their PODs become unique focal points for their data.
The Web 3.0 Data Space also implies that sooner or later, every real estate, vehicle, device, or even many parts of them will have their own separate PODs. All information regarding their history (ownership, origin, modifications, adjustments, etc.), their future (resource left, maintenance scheduled), and their interactions with other subjects and objects will become available to their owners, manufacturers, regulators, partners, etc.

Post-Platforms for Smart City
Post-PlatformsSciences | PoStartinblox|DigitaDigentitySolidLab| City of Amsterdam | City of Rio de Janeiro
CHALLENGE:
Various actors, from public services like Police and City planning to private companies in the transport, garbage processing, construction, and utilities, currently use hundreds and thousands of databases, platforms, apps, and systems, creating probably the biggest data silos ever, with an incredible amount of outdated records and data conflicts.
SUCCESS:
In our Web 3.0 Data Space solution, we place all data concerning each respective building, every road, as well as every significant part of the electricity, pipe, gas, and other networks on dedicated PODs.
Now every authorized entity, public or private, can work (read and write) with the very same data at the source, which is always correct and always up to date. This is the same approach as working with a shared document: every user works on the same original record and can see all changes in real-time.
We believe and can prove that a similar approach is totally realistic even for the biggest urban agglomerations.

BENEFITS:

Life quality improvement due to better data-based and citizen-centric policy making Better commuting thanks to optimized itineraries and real-time data on population and road infrastructure 100% correct and always up-to-date official records, used by each and every public service or by authorized private organizations Tax, address, and other public systems automation based on available data on every element of city infrastructure

Post-Platforms for Manufacturing
Post-Platforms Sciences | Po Startinblox | Digita Digentity | SolidLab
CHALLENGE:
Every large corporation nowadays suffers from too many poorly interconnected IT systems, databases, and platforms. Its even more challenging for large manufacturing companies where the number of systems may reach ~1000.

Even from the end-user perspective, this situation is quite stressful and energy-consuming: human resources are used in a non-optimal way because of all the files exchange, related paperwork, unautomated communications; etc. But if we look at it holistically, well see large business performances considerably impacted by these dozens or even hundreds of balkanized platforms and systems with their respective databases.

Lack of interoperability is the most apparent issue. Still, there is another one behind it: data silos, multiple copies of similar data without a clear understanding of which version is the most recent. These data silos automatically imply that there is no control over data quality and that your technical teams spend lots of effort to interconnect all these often almost incompatible systems and to coordinate their incoherent ontologies. Last but not least, it negatively affects data transmission outside the company, including both communications with its clients and all interactions with its suppliers and contractors, which is especially crucial for the manufacturing sector.

All these issues constantly keep too many human resources busy, consume too much energy, and result in the underperformance of the whole business.
SUCCESS:
Corporate data doesnt have to fit Procrustean beds of a multitude of different databases with different ontologies and data formats. Instead, it can be stored in a universal and fully machine-readable Linked Data format on separate secure virtual servers  we call them PODs  for each object you interact with.
Each machine or piece of equipment you use, each client or contractor you are connected with, can have such a POD with every single piece of data related to them stored there.

Post Platforms for Renewable Energy
Post-Platforms Sciences | Po Startinblox | Digita Digentity | SolidLab
CHALLENGE:
Lack of coordination for distributed energy generation: theres no single system to automatically monitor the real-time performance of each energy-generating device
- Lack of coordination for installation funding and energy purchase: individuals and organizations dont have access to up-to-date information regarding funding and other financial options available
- Lack of information for other available incentives: regional, national, and European renewable energy support programs often communicate quite poorly with their target audience and need to make their programs and incentives available to each and every user
- Lack of structured data regarding energy output, new and existing installations, etc., makes existing statistics imprecise and not always accurate, as a consequence impacting also the policy-making, construction of unnecessary new grids, creating non-optimized financial services, etc.
SUCCESS:
All data from every installation is stored on PODs, making their data instantly available (and fully machine-readable) for any authorized platform, including off-takers, providers, maintenance teams, etc.

The same abundant and well-structured data can now be analyzed by research institutions, University labs, policymaker's offices, etc., helping to improve their respective recommendations and decisions.

On the other hand, every public or financial institution also publishes their programs and projects on their own PODs, so that they are accessible to every interested individual or organization.

Post-Platforms for Automotive
Post-Platforms Sciences | Po Startinblox | Digita Digentity | SolidLab

CHALLENGE:
The automotive industry is one of the most complex manufacturing industries ever since it uses thousands of components made by hundreds of suppliers, and then handles the maintenance of millions of vehicles of hundreds of different makes and models.
Such large corporations nowadays suffer from too many poorly interconnected IT systems, databases, and platforms. Its even more challenging for automotive companies where a number of systems may easily overpass ~1000.

At the same time, the automotive industry is tightly connected to such complex niches as infotainment, cartography, itineraries, etc., where cars can and shall both receive road information from external sources and share the data the car records itself with other systems and vehicles.
SUCCESS:
Our solution is pretty straightforward. We connect a dedicated server - a POD - to each vehicle and its key components. Each POD stores all the telemetric data in real-time, and allows access and processing of this data via any authorized platform. These are the same IoT and smart vehicles we already know but on a totally new level of specification and accessibility.

Integrations with other systems, including geopositioning, itineraries, hotel bookings, charging stations, etc., become seamless since every vehicle and every respective entity or spot can now automatically exchange data through any platform selected by the manufacturer or by the owner.

SUCCESS:
The Tidy City experiment proposes to equip vehicles with mobile devices to take pictures and later process them to automatically detect and classify problems in publicly visible infrastructures. To reduce pollution and CO2 emissions, street-level images will be collected by a wide range of vehicles that already travel the city streets daily, such as waste collection trucks and express delivery vehicles.
The collected images are sent to a server for analysis and classification based on AI models. Within the scope of this experiment, the system will be able to detect and record the GPS location of damages in outdoor advertising, lightning, and electricity supply infrastructures, and improper waste disposal situations (e.g., waste outside containers, tires, old appliances, and furniture).
The detected occurrences data will be shared with each corresponding partner for integration and operations optimization. To comply with the RGPD and other European and National legal requirements, all personally identifiable information (e.g., peoples faces and license plates) will be removed from the images through the same privacy by-design processes already used by Google Street View.

BENEFITS:
The Data Space will allow for multiple interested parties to access detailed and treated information (AI applied to image frames does detect anomalies) regarding various kinds of occurrences detectable from the public streets. 

COMPONENTS:

This use case is part of the i4Trust second call for experiments, It will use FIWARE's Orion Context Broker protected with the gateway proxy Kong (open source) for the data sharing. The Identity Management will be done using Fiware's Keyrock (IDM) while applying iShare's specifications (rules of access in an Authorization Registry and parties validation in an iShare Satellite).

SUCCESS:
By utilizing the ManuSpace dataspace, manufacturers can not only reduce the cost to the patient but more importantly reduce the time it takes to get these life-saving medicines to the people that need them.
Through interoperable data sharing, we can ensure that contract manufacturing capacity is maximized. In turn, ManuSpace can help alleviate drug shortage problems for some of the most vulnerable in society.

BENEFITS:
As more and more, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies choose to outsource their manufacturing projects - companies must evaluate the performance of its Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs) and determine whether it meets industry and regulatory standards.
Companies outsource business activities to external partners for a variety of reasons  cost, flexibility, time to market, and core competence. This outsourcing leads to an increased risk of non-compliance to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) procedures which in turn is a risk to the brand reputation of the company.
Data integrity is critical in the pharmaceutical industry to make sure that the end products meet all the required quality standards. Enabling the digitisation and automation of cross-organisational business processes integral to pharmaceutical manufacturing will help improve supply chain security and help reduce the time to patient

Data Space for Multimodal Passenger Mobility
iShare.eu | fairsfair.org | IBM
SUCCESS:
GDPR compliance and collaboration are the two main issues in reshaping mobility. Data ownership and different vocabularies stand in the way. By decentralised identity management and the data clearing house functionality set in a blockchain, supporting data consistency,
we offer the foundation for transport operators, passenger and authorities to collaborate. Data can be (re)used for individual feedback, operational excellence and overall aligning the mobility services to the local needs. Fulfilling three out of four intermediary roles and using frontier technology IDS contributes to this. Lacking in IDS is the control over personal attributes, a solution we designed in a similar decentralised fashion as iShare

EdgeDS
Intracom Telecom
SUCCESS:
This use case addresses the emerging need for secure, trustworthy, and sovereign data
exchange among diverse stakeholders in edge computing ecosystems.

This approach integrates mechanisms for trustworthy and sovereign data exchange, into Multi-access Edge
Computing (MEC) environments, by extending the ETSI MEC Architectural Framework with
IDS components and enriching Edge Computing applications with data space capabilities in
an as-a-service paradigm.

BENEFITS:

This work highlights the feasibility and usability of incorporating an IDS Connector-as-a-Service within the MEC Platform, towards creating a data ecosystem that enables trustworthy and sovereign data exchange and intercommunication of multiple domains and applications that are hosted at the Edge. 
The proposed architecture provides the capability of utilizing and composing Dataspace-enabled MEC Applications, where any MEC App can act as a data service provider (potentially under some pricing scheme) towards other MEC Apps. This is not restricted to the supply of data but also extends to data processes (e.g., ML models, data analytics workflows, etc.). Moreover, the MEC Platform itself can offer such value-added services, in addition to secure data exchange services, which translate to additional revenue streams for the Communication Service Provider - CSP (who is operating the MEC Platform).
Last but not least, third-party data solutions providers can offer (B2B2C) such data processes to the CSPs to enrich their services on their MEC Platforms, without the need for third-party providers to run as MEC Apps, but rather by just providing the data processing models/software. To showcase the benefits of data-driven collaboration across systems and actors, we employ a motivating example use case from the Autonomous Driving domain. We envision different scenarios for autonomous, connected vehicles on a highway, which are powered with advanced safety, traffic routing, and other features through the enactment of data service ecosystems.
For instance, we consider the see-through case of a vehicle that intends to pass a truck and is temporarily provided access to a video stream of the car preceding that truck, which is equipped with a camera. Similar scenarios are applicable, such as the platooning of vehicles that can drive in a coordinated manner as a group, sharing sensing information, or the exchange of safety or traffic alerts between vehicles on the highway.


COMPONENTS:

This Use Case proposes the extension of the ETSI MEC architecture, by introducing the IDS- Connector-as-a-service, instilled directly into the MEC mechanisms. 
The prototype implementation of the proposed architecture includes the integration of the Dataspace Connector, implemented by Fraunhofer. In the introduced architecture, extending the MEC Architecture, each MEC Application (MEC App) can act as a data provider/consumer, in accordance with IDS roles distinction. 
By introducing the concept of IDS Connector-as-a-Service among the functionalities provided by the MEC Platform, each application is capable of obtaining its own connectorwhich exists within the MEC Platform as a MEC Platform-offered service instanceand can exchange data with any application that has a registered connector inside or outside of the MEC host. 
In the scenario of two MEC Applications exchanging data, we denote MEC App1 the application that attempts to receive data, and as MEC App2 the one that provides the desired data. After the completion of the instantiation of both applications and the assignment of a certified IDS connector to each of them, the connectors information is available through the MEC Platforms relevant API for service discovery and availability. While data services that are not IDS enabled are registered directly on the MEC Platform, MEC App2 registers the data resources it provides on its own connector. In order to consume the desired data services, MEC App1 receives the information of MEC App2s connector. Subsequently, MEC App1 performs a request to its own connector, encapsulating the information of the other connector, along with the identifiers of the targeted resources. Finally, if the usage policies attached to the contract of the requested resource are accepted, then data transfer from the provider to the consumer is followed as defined by IDS.

Green Deal Dataspace
Advaneo GmbH | IDSA
CHALLENGE:
The frequency of global crises such as pandemics, wars, and disasters has increased, and building shared solutions using data connections is crucial for dampening their effects and becoming more sustainable and resilient. The PAIRS and SPELL platforms are examples of prominent use cases that will be part of the Green Deal Dataspace.
The PAIRS platform, in particular, allows for transparency in the supply chain by identifying crises and their effects on individual participants. However, finding and using data in a sovereign way remains a core challenge. Interested parties need to know how to find services to become more resilient while ensuring data privacy and sovereignty. Additionally, creators of such services need to find initial partners to build the required networks.
SUCCESS:
The solution to the challenge of finding and using data in a sovereign way lies in using established and independently certifiable standards for data sharing, such as IDSA and GAIA-X.
These standards are integrated into a unified system that allows for offering, finding, and accessing relevant data sources and services related to resilience and sustainability. The IDS solution and its corresponding connectors are basic technologies that enable sovereign data exchange within the Green Deal Dataspace.

BENEFITS:

Companies and organizations as users of the Green Deal Dataspace benefit from our data-based approach to digital infrastructure to integrate decentralized information in a protected virtual space. With this infrastructure, users are either able to apply already implemented services or to develop new services supporting our users in order to gain new insights and knowledge. 
The variety of data sources which are part of the Green Deal Dataspace also facilitates cross-over domain approaches for services as also will be implemented inside the PAIRS-Plattform. Especially the supply chain use case as a cross-over domain service utilizes the different data sources coming from different. 
By additional search and finding functionalities inside the Green Deal Dataspace partners can connect to build research projects, exchange in a sovereign way data, and make use of the existing Dataspace infrastructure. In the end, this enables users to seamlessly build their own trustworthy resilience and sustainability ecosystems.

I4.0 data space and app marketplace for connected factories and service providers
Ikerlan
(1) i2CAT Foundation: technical partner responsible for the implementation and deployment of the IDS-compliant data space solution, App Store prototype, and integration of the data apps into the App Store. (2) CIM UPC Foundation: industry research partner with an experimental pilot factory floor with machinery and deployed IoT sensors where the collected data originates. (3) Universitat Politcnica de Catalunya (UPC) and their Motion Control and Industrial Applications (MCIA) and Advanced Control Systems (SAC) research groups: development of the data analytics and ML applications.
CHALLENGE:
The scenario brings up several challenges:

1. This data is susceptible, and timely, related to core production processes in the factory. Secure data transmission and agility are key, and traditional sharing methods are inadequate.

2. Factories must avoid lock-in situations to service providers, requiring interoperable approaches that allow them business flexibility in a competitive market of third-party services. This is equally important on the other side of the market, where SME service providers need an equal playing field for competing for that factorys business.

3. New and developing regulations, such as the Data Governance Act and Data Act, change the market dynamics of data exploitation, requiring a scalable solution for data sharing that is built around core principles such as data sovereignty.

SUCCESS:
The i2CAT Foundation in Barcelona has implemented an IDS-compliant data space and marketplace prototype in the regional Industry 4.0 project, Looming Factory. It addresses those aforementioned challenges via the following:

1. A minimal viable data space (MVDS) approach that securely connects the projects pilot factory floor machinery with developed predictive analytics services through a connector-based solution. The factory maintains strict usage control over its data, transmitted over a secure system.

2. An IDS App Store prototype implementation that allows those certified third-party providers services to be discovered by the factory and deployed in their secure, connector-based environment.

3. Third-party predictive analytics services for the marketplace proof of concept developed by Looming Factory project partners included predictive maintenance, operational cost estimation, production time cycles, and energy efficiency. These acted as demonstrators for the proposed solution for industry actors outside of the R&D project.

The Looming Factory project was co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund of the European Union in the framework of the ERDF Operational Program for Catalonia 2014-2020.

BENEFITS:

Enabling secure, sovereign data sharing in an ecosystem of I4.0 data services: IDS-compliant trusted environment for data sharing for secure, controlled exchange of sensitive production data between factories and third-party service providers. The factory is connected to a potential ecosystem of third-party data services that optimize their production processes: higher efficiency and lower OpEx.
Empowering business flexibility in the marketplace of competitive services: App Store prototype hosts and deploys innovative third-party data apps in an interoperable data space architecture. Factories are not locked into a single provider and have a selection of competing solutions, while SMEs can use the AppStore as an onboarding platform to provide their services to factory customers in an extensible data space.
Scalable solution for data regulatory compliance: I4.0 data service providers can deploy their solutions in an IDS-framework designed for future data regulation and evolving market dynamics between data and service providers.


COMPONENTS:

i2CAT has implemented the solution following the IDS-RAM 3.0 architecture and based on the Open Source implementations of the different components provided by IDSA. In particular, the solution includes the following components: (1) Dataspace Connector v8.0.0; (2) App Store v2.0.0; (3) DAPS (the Fraunhofer test certification authority was used, and specific digital certificates for the pilot were previously requested and issued.) These Open Source solutions have been modified and adapted to the specific needs of the use case, especially in terms of the connectivity between the Dataspace Connector and the App Store. The App Store has also been significantly improved with a new GUI and several services to connect it with a private docker image registry.

FutureForest
Freie Universitt Berlin | Technische Universitt Mnchen | M.O.S.S Computer Grafik Systeme GmbH
CHALLENGE:
Climate change makes the adaption of forests a very high-priority issue for forest owners and management companies. Without reliable data, it is very hard to make decisions in a fast-changing environment. Not acting will lead to economic and ecological losses. Traditionally, forest owners and practitioners rely little on data and have had no access to the data of others at all. This limits the discovery and adoption of best practices.
SUCCESS:
In our data space, forest research organizations, state forests, forest management companies and forest practitioners can access a common pool of relevant data, such as climate data, soil data, tree species distribution and tree health information, as well as in situ sensor data. It is well-defined who can access which data what for. As an example, the whole pool can be used to train AI models.

With this central, interoperable data pool, any new organization coming on board can quickly deploy state-of-the-art solutions to help in their decision-making, all the while retaining control over the data that they contribute.

BENEFITS:

Through the data space, risks related to climate change can be mitigated and revenue can be protected or enhanced, especially taking into account carbon capture and other incentiuves. Other ecosystem services can be enhanced, and as such, the value of the decision support given exceeds economic returns. The forestry data space also contributes to biodiversity and to the social and recreative functions of forests.

iGreenPort
HIADES | CIDIHUB | MNX Online | PLEYONE | CANARY Island Connection | JEMINOAL FARMAGROUP | FIWARE Foundation
CHALLENGE:
The quality of seawater is crucial to ensure the sustainability of ports. Coastal waters are deteriorating due to pollution and eutrophication, which is expected to increase by a further 20% by 2050. For this reason, the digitalization of port processes needs to consider the environmental perspective.
The combination of seawater quality data with information about ships characteristics and position is crucial for identifying the ships that could cause water pollution. iGreenPort addresses the real need of the Spanish Port of Palma de Mallorca to digitize the control of the seawater quality following the European Sea Ports Organizations SDG 14 Environmental Code of Conduct, which instructs port administrations to develop tools to manage environmental problems.
SUCCESS:
iGreenPort is a cutting-edge initiative that provides port authorities and other port agents with environmental management capabilities. It offers a Data Space for sharing and accessing environmental and operational data, combining two types of data:
1) Seawater quality data, starting with turbidity among 15 indicators mandatory by law.2) AIS data from ships, which provides information about the vessels every 3-6 seconds, including their characteristics and position. This data can be cross-referenced with the seawater quality data to determine their involvement in contaminated areas. The solution enables the authorities to make faster and more informed decisions that promote the efficiency and environmental sustainability of their ports.

BENEFITS:

Port Authorities are responsible for the prevention and control of marine pollution emergencies in their service area (Zone 1) and are investing in specialized surveillance to allow for rapid action in the event of pollution incidents. iGreenPort provides a cutting-edge tool for monitoring seawater quality in near real-time and identifying ships that could cause water pollution.

HUAWEI Data Space
Huawei | Fraunhofer ISST
CHALLENGE:
 Data exchange economy needs a trust mechanism for cross-subject data flow for different data sharing scenarios (B2B, B2C, G2C and G2B)
 To achieve trusted framework a data usage control mechanism needs to be implemented to manage and monitor the entire process of data exchange
 Automated cross-entity data usage control policy is required with contracts and effective performance with blockchain technology
Sovereign Control should enable data owners to decide how data is used:
 Construct an ecosystem with Multi-Party Trust, for performing trustworthy authentication on organizations, individuals, and technical components through qualification assessment and certificate issuance, establish a unified trust mechanism, and ensure that participants' identities and platform environments are trusted
 Create composable policies to control data access, and set policies based on data use (ie. validity period, number of viewing times or downloads, access rights). Control use of data to ensure that data is used in compliance with laws and regulations based on data sovereignty and control
 Support data provider to verify and trace user access, and exempt consumers can be exempted from the certificate. Provide reliable and visible audit tracing services throughout the process, support providers to verify and trace, and if needed to revoke certificates from consumers, and provide corresponding audit information for third-party supervision
SUCCESS:
IDS-RAM and Eclipse Dataspace Components are at the core of a Huawei Data Space solution, that has been created to address business challenges listed above, and has been developed in compliance with and according to IDS specification (with new IDS components to be included)

BENEFITS:

Global economy consists of a variety of data suppliers and consumers in the upstream and downstream industry chains. To promote the rapid development of a data-based economy and to improve production efficiency, data must be effectively shared and data sovereignty must be guaranteed. Huawei Data Space solution provides key service value streams such as data provision, data consumption, and data operation supervision and control.Based on an IDS Data Space technology it ensures that data flows are trusted, controllable, and verifiable.

The ENES Data Space
Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC) | Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) | Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)
CHALLENGE:
The European Network for Earth System (ENES) modeling community was launched in 2001 comprising a network of about 50 groups including public, academic, and industrial partners who agreed to work together and cooperate to discuss strategies to accelerate progress in climate, Earth system modeling and understanding.

This community is a key player in the assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and provides the multi-model climate projections on which EU mitigation and adaptation policies are built.

The ENES community is facing new challenges as a result of the increased model complexity and the availability of emerging computing platforms. Moreover, new multi-disciplinary audiences need access to the ever-increasing volumes of data for addressing climate change societal challenges.

SUCCESS:Data, services, and tools represent the three fundamental components of the ENES Data Space ecosystem. The data offering is at the core of the data space. However, it is important to remark that data alone would not be enough without a comprehensive ecosystem, including a wide set of tools and services enabling scientists to develop applications, analyze data, visualize results, reproduce analyses, share code, and publish new products. Through the seamless integration of these different aspects, the ENES Data Space aims to support challenging climate-related analyses and applications. IDS would play a key role in this allowing the ENES Data Space to adopt or be compliant with standards in the field, thus enabling increased data sharing based on trustworthy technology and interoperable formats.

BENEFITS:
The ENES Data Space aims to provide climate scientists with a complete ready-to-use research environment enabling them to perform scientific analysis on large climate datasets. Providing scientists with large ready-to-use datasets and software solutions closely integrated with the computing infrastructure can almost completely eliminate the setup time and dramatically increase productivity. Moreover, the possibility of easily reusing applications and sharing the research outputs represents a key aspect in the scientific analysis process towards Open Science and a more sustainable, effective, and FAIR use of data.
Overall, the ENES Data Space can democratize climate data analysis by supporting new user groups and communities that do not currently have access to solutions capable of addressing such large-scale analysis.

COMPONENTS:
The ENES Data Space architecture consists of the following functional components:

a) Gateway Interface and Authentication/Authorization (Identity Provider)
b) Data Science Environment including
i) Analytics engines
ii) Data cataloging utility and related domain-specific Data Reference Syntax, controlled vocabularies, and conventions

CADS - Carbon Agri Data Space
Rezos Brands S.A. | NOSC UA DIH (KAU) | DIH Faubourg Numrique | BIOINVEST-AGRO | FARMLEAP | OKP4 | PROINT PROJECTEN | Trusty | iSolutions Labs
CHALLENGE:
One of the biggest challenges in agriculture today is the use of heterogeneous data for smart farming technologies, improving soil fertility, and food quality, and reducing the impact of agricultural technologies on climate change.
Today, numerous sources of data are collected and not leveraged as much as they could be. Potential applications are huge, such as decision-support tools taking into account not only scientific recommendations but also information about the experience of using various agricultural additives for specific climatic and environmental conditions. Carbon measurement and estimation are promising applications to improve the existing systems, but also to provide new value streams for farmers.

SUCCESS:
The idea is a service for the assessment of the carbon footprint of agricultural products in the process of growing as well as tools for sound adjustment of agro-technological, organizational, and management decisions by food producers. Thanks to a data-sharing ecosystem, we will provide the opportunity for farmers (through data service providers interacting with the decentralized data-sharing infrastructure), to leverage the use of the data they already produce, combined with other data sources such as external and open data.
It will provide them with tools that will help the farmers to come up with tangible proof of their carbon impact. Also, dedicated stakeholders of the ecosystem will find go-to-market opportunities for these proofs, bringing back value for the whole ecosystem.

BENEFITS:

Data sharing will demonstrate benefits for many participants  in optimizing existing products, valorizing bi-products, and making data space partners more attractive to downstream users in selecting new primary producers for new product lines within the carbon-negative economy. Also, some outputs of the data space are valued by the market, and this value will be distributed among contributors, according to a fair business model driven by the rising price per tonne of CO2-e in the market as EU-wide sequestration targets drive large-scale investors to increase the volume of carbon-negative market products becoming available at scale (including on-farm soil carbon sequestration and long-cycle productization).

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

TRUSTEE - Trust and privacy preserving computing platform for cross-border federation of data
VTT | FORTH | HMU | VTT | Panasonic Automotive Systems Europe GmbH | The University of Vienna | K3Y | ACCELIGENCE | Universit Cattolica del Sacro Cuore | Ericsson Nikola Tesla | Adrestia R&D | TECNALIA | RINA | ZORTENET | InQbit Innovations | FUJITSU | Hewlett Packard Enterprise | CDS | The Institute of Space Science | CheckWatt AB | Athena Research Center | Edinburgh Napier University | Etoile Partners LTD
SUCCESS:
In a data-driven world, interdisciplinary and geographically dispersed data repositories naturally emerge. These repositories may not always adhere to established interdisciplinary data representation standards or participate in data federation initiatives. As a result, researchers often face limited access to valuable data, and maintaining integrity, privacy, and security during data exchanges can be exceptionally challenging, if not impossible.

The EU-funded TRUSTEE project aims to address these challenges by delivering a green, secure, trustworthy, and privacy-aware framework. This framework will aggregate data from multiple interdisciplinary repositories in sectors such as healthcare, education, energy, space, automotive, and cross-border domains. Additionally, TRUSTEE will integrate with other European data federation spaces and transnational initiatives, including IDS and Gaia-X.

This integration between the TRUSTEE framework and IDS/Gaia-X initiatives will create a synergy where additional data providers can participate, allowing IDS/Gaia-X data providers to leverage TRUSTEE's capabilities. Simultaneously, TRUSTEE users will gain access to the data hosted on e.g., IDS connectors, fostering collaboration and data sharing across domains.


COMPONENTS:

In the TRUSTEE framework, the IDS connector serves as the bridge connecting IDS data spaces to TRUSTEE, facilitating seamless data exchange between these entities. The dynamic attributes provisioning service (DAPS) enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates received from the Certificate Authority (CA). In TRUSTEE the metadata broker service can be utilized as an additional metadata repository enabling e.g., the TRUSTEE compatible IDS connector to discover data resources that other IDS connectors can offer for TRUSTEE platform users.

CHALLENGE:
Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, and Romania are part of the countries that are lagging in terms of digitalization of the healthcare sector and innovation-driven initiatives therein (as per reports of ICT&Health, DESI Index, and others).
Current regulations in these countries provide a framework to set up centralized healthcare databases but offer no specific guidance on interoperability standards.
The innovation potential in the healthcare domain of the 4 participating widening countries is growing but specific policies and instruments for support are necessary to be adopted.
Available funding mechanisms do not encompass the whole field of Digital Health and Innovation, whereas there are many innovative start-ups and companies needing guidance in their path of innovation excellence in the healthcare domain.

Business Expertise
Business expertise focusing on creating most adequate business models for monetization of data and associated services.

Example from Energy Domain - Offshore Wind Energy Data Space use case: Currently, only windfarm operators and OEMs have access to the data collected from the wind energy turbines in operation and therefore they are the only players that are presently extracting value out of data. Most European components suppliers and ICT companies do not have access to this data missing the opportunity to improve their competitiveness through digitalization of products and services. In this context, in Tecnalia together with the Basque Energy Cluster we are designing and developing an offshore wind digital platform based on IDSA reference architecture to enable data sharing amongst all the actors of the value chain.






Technical Expertise
Technical expertise from different R&D projects, focusing on: connectors, broker, usage control, clearing house, info model and vocabulary provider.

Example from Manufacturing Domain - TECNALIA Industry division has implemented a connection of manufacturing services (proprietary and external) to the central IDS modules (CA, Broker) through their IDS configured connector. In addition, TECNALIA has implemented a manufacturing data space based on the IDS RA to market manufacturing equipment. At last, TECNALIA is working on the implementation of IDS RA in the interaction of the manufacturing companies with the DIH ecosystem.

CHALLENGE:
A digital twin links several models of predictable features of an object and enables the simulation of scenarios of the same. In this way, the impact of new technologies on local climate, air quality and health can be demonstrated.
SUCCESS:
Developing a digital twin (or digital shadow) requires access to different data sources, efficient data management and data cleansing strategies. In addition, it requires resources for computationally intensive modelling, as well as evaluation processes and (online) feedback on the simulated entity. The possibility to exchange data in a decentralised way while maintaining data sovereignty is a key enabling factor.

COMPONENTS

Introduction
In enabling clients toward the use of data spaces, Detecon relies on established methods of data thinking and data integration to provide clients with individualized solutions. This allows for both comprehensive and focused viewpoints to be taken in delivering on the value of data spaces for organizations.






Technical Expertise
Detecon, as a technology-oriented management consultancy, supports the implementation of data spaces from both a business and technology perspective by structuring the creation of trust-based, sovereign data ecosystems across organizational boundaries using an established framework, collaboratively designing interoperable information models and data architectures, and enabling new business applications that meet specific requirements for cost-effectiveness and feasibility.

Building on competencies in data strategy, data integration, data analytics, and data-driven business models, Detecon takes a comprehensive approach to data spaces. Along the core methodology and depending on the project's scope, the target definition for the data space use case is first defined, the data ecosystem of the involved parties is assessed, and within the boundaries of these considerations, a data space can then be designed and implemented.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Advancing global interoperability: The role of standardization in data spaces

We've reached a critical moment in the journey of IDS, where standardization is no longer just a choice; it's a must-have. Just like USB, HTML, Wi-Fi, or electrical plug sockets, standards form the backbone of global interoperability and trade. This holds true for communication within and between data spaces as well.




Silvia Castellvi



International standards are indispensable in facilitating collaboration. They play a critical role in promoting interoperability, breaking down technical barriers, and fostering cross-border trade. Adhering to these common standards enables businesses to streamline their operations, tap into global markets, and provide top-notch products and services to consumers. Recognizing the importance of aligning with standardization bodies like ISO, CEN/CENELEC, IEEE and W3C, we are committed to advancing global standards for data sharing.
Our drive for global standardization
Our commitment is driven by the dedicated efforts of IDSA members and technical staff who actively participate in standards committees. From observing to leading these committees, we build strategic partnerships with key standardization bodies, advising the European Commission on advancing global standards for data spaces. Leveraging assets such as the IDS Reference Architecture Model (IDS RAM), the IDS Rulebook, and the Dataspace Protocol, we contribute to developing essential technical specifications for implementing data spaces.
European standardization initiatives
Within the European context, regulations like the Digital Markets Act (DMA), Data Governance Act (DGA), Data Act and AI Act emphasize the need for tailored standardization efforts. Collaborative research with CEN/CENELEC is important in addressing these specific standardization needs and strengthening Europes digital economy. Initiatives like the CEN/CENELEC Focus Group on Data, Dataspaces, Cloud, and Edge and the proposed Technical Committee on Data Management, Data Spaces, Cloud, and Edge Computing are instrumental in shaping European standardization policies.

Collaboration with the European Commission
The IDSA collaborates closely with the European Commission to align standardization efforts with EU policy priorities. The Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC) collaborates with the European Data Innovation Board to recommend guidelines for unified European data spaces. By enhancing data interoperability and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations, these efforts contribute significantly to the EUs digital transformation agenda.
Our collective commitment to driving global standardization in data spaces paves the way for a more connected, efficient, and innovative future for businesses and societies worldwide.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.

Handling applicant data
We offer website visitors the opportunity to submit job applications to us (e.g., via e-mail, via postal services on by submitting the online job application form). Below, we will brief you on the scope, purpose and use of the personal data collected from you in conjunction with the application process. We assure you that the collection, processing, and use of your data will occur in compliance with the applicable data privacy rights and all other statutory provisions and that your data will always be treated as strictly confidential.
Scope and purpose of the collection of data
If you submit a job application to us, we will process any affiliated personal data (e.g., contact and communications data, application documents, notes taken during job interviews, etc.), if they are required to make a decision concerning the establishment or an employment relationship. The legal grounds for the aforementioned are  26 BDSG according to German Law (Negotiation of an Employment Relationship), Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (General Contract Negotiations) and  provided you have given us your consent  Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke any consent given at any time. Within our company, your personal data will only be shared with individuals who are involved in the processing of your job application.
If your job application should result in your recruitment, the data you have submitted will be archived on the grounds of  26 BDSG and Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship in our data processing system.
Data Archiving Period
If we are unable to make you a job offer or you reject a job offer or withdraw your application, we reserve the right to retain the data you have submitted on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) for up to 6 months from the end of the application procedure (rejection or withdrawal of the application). Afterwards the data will be deleted, and the physical application documents will be destroyed. The storage serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. If it is evident that the data will be required after the expiry of the 6-month period (e.g., due to an impending or pending legal dispute), deletion will only take place when the purpose for further storage no longer applies.
Longer storage may also take place if you have given your agreement (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) or if statutory data retention requirements preclude the deletion.
Admission to the applicant pool
If we do not make you a job offer, you may be able to join our applicant pool. In case of admission, all documents and information from the application will be transferred to the applicant pool in order to contact you in case of suitable vacancies.
Admission to the applicant pool is based exclusively on your express agreement (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). The submission agreement is voluntary and has no relation to the ongoing application procedure. The affected person can revoke his agreement at any time. In this case, the data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted, provided there are no legal reasons for storage.
The data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted no later than two years after consent has been granted.

Increased visibility of order delivery process
VTT | Wrtsil | Uwira
CHALLENGE:
The use case revolves around expediting and enhancing transparency between a focal company of a manufacturing ecosystem (OEM) and its supplier in their production order management processes. The existing communication methods have proven inadequate in facilitating efficient and adaptable exchanges between the two entities. By facilitating transparency and fostering a more seamless integration between the IT systems of both companies, the management of product orders can be streamlined, resulting in heightened efficiency and a reduction in errors.
SUCCESS:
The objective is to facilitate a reliable and seamless flow of data between the OEM and its supplier by establishing a dedicated data space. The developed solution will be seamlessly integrated with pre-existing IT infrastructures of both companies and the solution is grounded in the framework of the IDS reference architecture.
The OEM can selectively disclose data from their production environment to the supplier without the fear of data leakages. Respectively, the supplier receives only the data that are essential for them and there is no need to locally extract meaningful insights and valuable information from big data sets.

BENEFITS:

The established data space solution has the potential to significantly enhance transparency between the OEM and the supplier. This gives rise to several potential benefits, including:
Effective Communication: Transparent communication helps in conveying accurate information about product specifications, requirements, changes, and timelines.
Risk Management: Sharing information about potential risks, such as changes in demand or design modifications, allows suppliers to proactively address these issues. Furthermore, in times of disruptions, such as supply shortages or unexpected market shifts, transparent communication helps both parties respond more effectively.
Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows both parties to work together to find cost-effective solutions.


COMPONENTS:

IDS connectors - serve as the communication interface linking the two companies and their existing IT systems. With IDS connectors, a data provider can define the rules and conditions (usage policies) under which data are shared with a data consumer.
DAPS - enables connectors to authenticate themselves using X.509 certificates. After successful authentication, the DAPS issues OAuth2 access tokens for connectors, who need these tokens to access the services and data of other connectors.
Metadata Broker stores information about the data end-points offered by the participants. The broker provides a query interface for connectors and can hence be considered as the search engine in this use case.
