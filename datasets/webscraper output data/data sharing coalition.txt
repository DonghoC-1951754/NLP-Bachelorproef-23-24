The Data Sharing Coalition is an open and growing, international initiative in which a large variety of organisations collaborate on unlocking the value of (cross-sectoral) data sharing.

Our mission is to unlock the true value of data sharing by supporting organisations in realising scalable data spaces, the next evolutionary concept in data sharing. Through the development of generic building blocks and collaborative efforts, we enable easier and cost-effective implementation of data spaces across sectors and geographies.The CoE-DSC is the central hub in the Netherlands to find answers to data sharing challenges. We bring together the expertise and achievements of the Data Sharing Coalition, the Data Sharing working group of the Dutch AI Coalition (NL AIC), and the Gaia-X Hub Netherlands. By uniting these forces, we aim to prevent fragmentation and provide the Dutch data sharing community with a centralised hub of knowledge, tools, and expertise.


Insights


Parties interested in deploying a data space need to use the right technologies and need to make sure they get the business and governance of the data space right. This is easier said than done, because there is relatively little guidance on how to deploy a data space successfully. What guidance can be given?



In the Netherlands, there are various initiatives that are working on improving the digital position of the country. How do the CoE-DSC and Topsector ICT collaborate? What are data sharing trends and how can we shape the future?



Data spaces and Privacy Enhancing Technologies have a common goal: making insights from data accessible in a confidential manner. But the development of both is driven by two different communities. This must change. By applying PETs within data spaces, confidentially exchanging insights from (privacy sensitive) data becomes more scalable.
Use cases

Our participant Linksight collaborates with DSW, the municipality of Delft and elderly care organisation Pieter van Foreest and uses Multi-party Computation to generate insights without sharing the data itself, which helps to monitor and improve elderly care.


Together with our participant SBR Nexus, data of industry association members is shared with industry associations to create valuable insights about the whole sector.


Together with participants Knights Analytics and Roseman Labs, we examined the application of Artificial Intelligence Entity Resolution technology to help combat financial crime.


Together with our participant Impact IoT Solutions and HAN and De Marke, we examine the value potential of new data sources for dairy farming and the most important conditions to unlock these new data sources in a use case.


Together with our participants Sustainable Rescue Foundation, Roseman Labs and NGOs and other participants, we work on a use case that focuses on secure data exchange between different parties monitoring human trafficking.


A model has been developed that can automatically assign an ICD-10 code to half of the records as accurately as human coders can. For the remainder, the coder is given suggestions, simplifying the coding work and further training the model.

Frequently Asked Questions




The CoE-DSC functions as a central hub for market players seeking solutions to develop trust in data sharing by providing access to relevant tools, knowledge, and best practices. The CoE-DSC is an open collaborative initiative seeking alignment with sectoral data sharing initiatives avoid fragmentation in solutions. CoE-DSC combines all knowledge and expertise that has been developed within the Working Group Data Sharing of the NL AIC, the Data Sharing Coalition, and the Gaia-X Hub NL, and provides access to open-source components, standards and implementations that are currently available in the market.




At the moment, further information on the tools and guidelines can be found on the websites of the original initiatives. All documents can be downloaded on the websites of the original initiatives. Links to existing tools and guidelines are:Furthermore, we are currently working on creating an inventory of reusable open-source components, standards, and implementations available in the market.




Members of the CoE-DSC community get the opportunity to participate in the development of (cross-sectoral) data sharing use cases with support from experts andtools, gain and share knowledge about (cross-sectoral) data sharing through participation in various activities organized by the CoE-DSC and collaborate with other participants.This means being involved in new initiatives and projects, and becoming part of an open and active community that will enrich your network.




No membership fee is charged to CoE-DSC community members. However, we do ask an in-kind commitment from our community members. In-kind commitment consists of actively contributing to the knowledge community by attending community activities, as well as participating in the development of data sharing use cases.




Organisations that are interested can join the Centre of Excellence for Data Sharing and Cloud by following these four simple steps:Reach out to the dedicated project team of the CoE-DSC to express interest in joining the CoE-DSC community by sending an email to:Join an introductory appointment/intake call to get acquainted and to discuss the details of participation (role and commitment)Confirm participation, agreed role, and level of commitmentGet onboarded and invited to all relevant meetings
