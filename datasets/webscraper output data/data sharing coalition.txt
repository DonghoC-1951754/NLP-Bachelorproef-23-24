The CoE-DSC aims to unlock this value by supporting organisations in realising scalable data spaces, the next evolutionary concept in data sharing.Who we areOne central hub in the Netherlands to find answers to data sharing challengesThe Centre of Excellence  Data Sharing and Cloud (CoE-DSC) supports organisations with establishing trust mechanisms for secure and trusted data sharing, ensuring that they can tap into the business opportunities this transformative practice offers. Our mission is to unlock the true value of data sharing by supporting organisations in realising scalable data spaces, the next evolutionary concept in data sharing. Through the development of generic building blocks and collaborative efforts, we enable easier and cost-effective implementation of data spaces across sectors and geographies.The CoE-DSC is the central hub in the Netherlands to find answers to data sharing challenges. We bring together the expertise and achievements of the Data Sharing Coalition, the Data Sharing working group of the Dutch AI Coalition (NL AIC), and the Gaia-X Hub Netherlands. By uniting these forces, we aim to prevent fragmentation and provide the Dutch data sharing community with a centralised hub of knowledge, tools, and expertise.Learn moreGet data sharing supportInsightsInterviewJoining forces at a national level to have an influence at a European levelIn the Netherlands, there are various initiatives that are working on improving the digital position of the country. How do the CoE-DSC and Topsector ICT collaborate? What are data sharing trends and how can we shape the future?Read moreInterviewThe benefits of combining data spaces and Privacy Enhancing TechnologiesData spaces and Privacy Enhancing Technologies have a common goal: making insights from data accessible in a confidential manner. But the development of both is driven by two different communities. This must change. By applying PETs within data spaces, confidentially exchanging insights from (privacy sensitive) data becomes more scalable.Read moreNewsDSSC introduces Blueprint 1.0: the evolution of data spacesThe Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC) has announced the recent release of the Blueprint 1.0.Read moreUse casesMore use casesAdvancing data collaboration for monitoring the Dutch elderly care through MPC technologyOur participant Linksight collaborates with DSW, the municipality of Delft and elderly care organisation Pieter van Foreest and uses Multi-party Computation to generate insights without sharing the data itself, which helps to monitor and improve elderly care.Discover this use caseBenchmarking for industry associationsTogether with our participant SBR Nexus, data of industry association members is shared with industry associations to create valuable insights about the whole sector.Discover this use caseCombining AI Entity Resolution with MPC to help combatting financial crimeTogether with participants Knights Analytics and Roseman Labs, we examined the application of Artificial Intelligence Entity Resolution technology to help combat financial crime.Discover this use caseData-driven agriculture: the value potential of data for dairy farmersTogether with our participant Impact IoT Solutions and HAN and De Marke, we examine the value potential of new data sources for dairy farming and the most important conditions to unlock these new data sources in a use case.Discover this use caseImproved monitoring of human trafficking by sharing insightsTogether with our participants Sustainable Rescue Foundation, Roseman Labs and NGOs and other participants, we work on a use case that focuses on secure data exchange between different parties monitoring human trafficking.Discover this use caseLandscape: AI for administrative load reduction in the care sectorA model has been developed that can automatically assign an ICD-10 code to half of the records as accurately as human coders can.

Traditionally, organisations establish bilateral connections or share their data through a central platform controlled by a single party. However, these approaches carry the risk of vendor lock-in, fragmentation, and limited value creation.Data spaces are the next evolution in data sharingThe next evolution in data sharing is the concept of data spaces. A data space is a decentralised infrastructure that organisations can use to make their data accessible to others based on specific agreements. Any party adhering to these agreements can participate and exchange data. Data spaces offer the scalability that traditional methods canoot offer, enabling greater innovation and economic and societal value. Examples of existing live data spaces in the Netherlands includeSCSNandHDN, as well as theMobility Data Spacein Germany.The CoE-DSC supports the realisation of data spacesSignificant barriers still exist when establishing data spaces, such as building trust between participants, complying with regulations, developing governance structures, and defining business models. The CoE-DSC aims to lower these barriers and help participants realise the full potential of data sharing initiatives.Reach out to us viainfo@coe-dsc.nlif:You want to implement a use case at scale.You need technical or operational support for your data sharing initiative.You want to join our community, which consists of over 500 participants.Whilst supporting the realisation of data spaces, the CoE-DSC closely monitors the impact of the European Data Strategy and proposed regulations like the Data Act to ensure compliance, and collaborates with theData Spaces Support Centre(DSSC).Get data sharing supportOur missionOur mission is to realise a generic data sharing infrastructureThe long-term mission of the CoE-DSC is to develop a generic data sharing infrastructure that enables seamless data sharing between existing data spaces. By promoting interoperability, parties from different sectors and domains can efficiently share data and unlock new use cases with economic and societal value.By working on practical data sharing use cases and gathering expertise from our participants, we take tangible steps towards realising this mission.We are an open and inclusive initiative.
