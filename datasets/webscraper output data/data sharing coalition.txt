Centre of Excellence for Data Sharing and Cloud (CoE-DSC)The true value of data can only be realised if it is shared and re-used throughout the digital economy. The CoE-DSC aims to unlock this value by supporting organisations in realising scalable data spaces, the next evolutionary concept in data sharing.Who we areOne central hub in the Netherlands to find answers to data sharing challengesThe Centre of Excellence  Data Sharing and Cloud (CoE-DSC) supports organisations with establishing trust mechanisms for secure and trusted data sharing, ensuring that they can tap into the business opportunities this transformative practice offers. Our mission is to unlock the true value of data sharing by supporting organisations in realising scalable data spaces, the next evolutionary concept in data sharing. Through the development of generic building blocks and collaborative efforts, we enable easier and cost-effective implementation of data spaces across sectors and geographies.The CoE-DSC is the central hub in the Netherlands to find answers to data sharing challenges. We bring together the expertise and achievements of the Data Sharing Coalition, the Data Sharing working group of the Dutch AI Coalition (NL AIC), and the Gaia-X Hub Netherlands. By uniting these forces, we aim to prevent fragmentation and provide the Dutch data sharing community with a centralised hub of knowledge, tools, and expertise.


Insights


Parties interested in deploying a data space need to use the right technologies and need to make sure they get the business and governance of the data space right. This is easier said than done, because there is relatively little guidance on how to deploy a data space successfully. What guidance can be given?



In the Netherlands, there are various initiatives that are working on improving the digital position of the country. How do the CoE-DSC and Topsector ICT collaborate? What are data sharing trends and how can we shape the future?



Data spaces and Privacy Enhancing Technologies have a common goal: making insights from data accessible in a confidential manner. But the development of both is driven by two different communities. This must change. By applying PETs within data spaces, confidentially exchanging insights from (privacy sensitive) data becomes more scalable.
Use cases

Our participant Linksight collaborates with DSW, the municipality of Delft and elderly care organisation Pieter van Foreest and uses Multi-party Computation to generate insights without sharing the data itself, which helps to monitor and improve elderly care.


Together with our participant SBR Nexus, data of industry association members is shared with industry associations to create valuable insights about the whole sector.


Together with participants Knights Analytics and Roseman Labs, we examined the application of Artificial Intelligence Entity Resolution technology to help combat financial crime.


Together with our participant Impact IoT Solutions and HAN and De Marke, we examine the value potential of new data sources for dairy farming and the most important conditions to unlock these new data sources in a use case.


Together with our participants Sustainable Rescue Foundation, Roseman Labs and NGOs and other participants, we work on a use case that focuses on secure data exchange between different parties monitoring human trafficking.


A model has been developed that can automatically assign an ICD-10 code to half of the records as accurately as human coders can. For the remainder, the coder is given suggestions, simplifying the coding work and further training the model.

About the CoE-DSCWho we areData sharing has the potential to generate new economic and societal value. Traditionally, organisations establish bilateral connections or share their data through a central platform controlled by a single party. However, these approaches carry the risk of vendor lock-in, fragmentation, and limited value creation.Data spaces are the next evolution in data sharingThe next evolution in data sharing is the concept of data spaces. A data space is a decentralised infrastructure that organisations can use to make their data accessible to others based on specific agreements. Any party adhering to these agreements can participate and exchange data. Data spaces offer the scalability that traditional methods canoot offer, enabling greater innovation and economic and societal value. Examples of existing live data spaces in the Netherlands includeand, as well as thein Germany.The CoE-DSC supports the realisation of data spacesSignificant barriers still exist when establishing data spaces, such as building trust between participants, complying with regulations, developing governance structures, and defining business models. The CoE-DSC aims to lower these barriers and help participants realise the full potential of data sharing initiatives.Reach out to us via if:You want to implement a use case at scale.You need technical or operational support for your data sharing initiative.You want to join our community, which consists of over 500 participants.Whilst supporting the realisation of data spaces, the CoE-DSC closely monitors the impact of the European Data Strategy and proposed regulations like the Data Act to ensure compliance, and collaborates with the(DSSC).
