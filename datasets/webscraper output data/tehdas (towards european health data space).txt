Joint Action Towards the European Health Data Space  TEHDAS
The TEHDAS Joint Action developed European principles for the secondary use of health data.
A new joint action will start in 2024 and build on TEHDAS work. TEHDAS was carried out by 25 European countries and co-ordinated by the Finnish Innovation Fund, Sitra. The project started in February 2021 and ended in July 2023. It was based on the European Commissions Health Programme 2020. 








TEHDAS findings now in single report  
The EHDS will change how health data is used in the EU for research, innovation and policymaking.
TEHDAS impact can be seen in the EU Commissions proposal, which will benefit all in Europe for decades to come.

Our goal was that, in the future, European citizens, communities and companies would benefit from secure and seamless access to health data regardless of where it is stored.
TEHDAS, the joint action Towards the European Health Data Space, helped EU member states and the European Commission to develop and promote concepts for the secondary use of health data to benefit public health and health research and innovation in Europe.
Our goal was that, in the future, European citizens, communities and companies would benefit from secure and seamless access to health data regardless of where it is stored.
The project focused on:

engaging other European projects and policymakers in a dialogue about the European Health Data Space;
ensuring sustainability of the secondary use of health data in Europe;
developing a governance model for cross-border co-operation in the secondary use of health data between European countries;
promoting the reliability and compatibility of and access to health data for secondary use;
clarifying the role of individuals in the secondary use of health data and including them in dialogue about the use of health data for research and policymaking.

The results of the TEHDAS project provided elements to the European Commissions legislative proposal on the  as well as supported the pan-European dialogue that followed the proposal.
What was it about?
The cross-border sharing of health data has so far been project-based and there are no legal bases or common practices for the secondary use of health data in Europe. A lack of clarity and differing interpretations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means that health data is being underused in research and decision-making.
The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for European-wide health data sharing and co-ordination.
The primary use of health data is the use of health information, such as patient records, to treat a person. The secondary use of health data means using health data for purposes other than the primary reason for which they were originally collected. The secondary use can be, for example, research, decision-making, development and innovation, and education.
The benefits of the secondary use of health data include providing better healthcare services and personalised care for people, and thereby saving lives, increased business opportunities for companies and cost savings for societies.
Who was involved?
The TEHDAS project from 21 EU member states and four other European countries. The project was co-ordinated by the .
TEHDAS was funded by the  and the European countries involved.
Where are we now?
The project started on 1 February 2021 and ran until 31 July 2023.
TEHDAS produced  for the European Commission and member states to enable EU-wide secondary use of health data. The  were combined in a single report and published on 14 September 2023.  
 under the EUs fourth Health Programme (EU4Health) that will start in 2024 with the participation of 29 European countries.

 /  / EU-wide collaboration needed to optimise health data use for research and innovation 






        Published on 14.09.2023
      

        14.09.2023
      

EU-wide collaboration needed to optimise health data use for research and innovation
The European health data space (EHDS) will bring about a major change in the way health data is used in the European Union and therefore affects us all. Thanks to the Sitra-led TEHDAS project, the use of health data for research and innovation in the EU has already taken a major step forward. The successful realisation of EHDS will require broad collaboration. 

The capacity of different EU countries to facilitate the use of health data for research and innovation varies widely, according to the results of the joint action Towards the European Health Data Space (TEHDAS). For the EU-wide use of health data to be successful and sustainable, EU and national legislation need to be clarified.Currently, European researchers, policy-makers and businesses face many obstacles to accessing health data nationally and across borders. At present, data cannot be fully used, to the detriment of health policy and innovation such as the development of more effective medicines and treatments.The main obstacle is different interpretations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In addition, practices for collecting and processing health data vary from one EU country to another because of differences in their national legislation.Although the EHDS plans to harmonise the secondary use of health data by creating a common legal framework, the results clearly indicate that all member states need to take steps to meet the requirements of the EHDS.
Enabling secure access to quality data
In the future, decisions on using health data will be taken by a specialised authority in each country, a health data access body. Access to data would only be allowed for specific purposes.The TEHDAS project developed a data quality framework which aims to ensure that health data collected across Europe and reused for policymaking, regulation and research is reliable enough and fit for purpose.The project also produced recommendations on secure data processing environments and related practices across national borders. The European Commissions proposal for a regulation on the EHDS in 2022 includes these recommendations. Protecting peoples privacy will be enhanced by defining common practices for data sharing and use across Europe.
Stakeholder engagement at the heart of the project
TEHDAS fostered dialogue with policymakers and other key stakeholders at national and EU level to raise awareness of the profound changes that are expected once the EHDS regulation enters into force. This has increased the readiness of the member states and the Commission to establish the EHDS.Public engagement showed that people are interested in sharing their health data but with clear safeguards for privacy and security.Throughout the project, TEHDAS prioritised stakeholder engagement by hosting forums and other events and participating in almost 300 speaking engagements across Europe. The main TEHDAS events attracted about 2000 European stakeholders to discuss the use of health data in Europe.
A lasting contribution to EU regulation
In TEHDAS, 25 European countries have developed policy options and recommendations needed to make peoples health data more seamlessly and securely accessible. The aim has been to improve the secondary use of health data in the EU to enable better health for all.The project has been led by Sitra and is part of a wider EHDS initiative, where health data would be available on request for both research and for patient care, wherever patients are in Europe.In May 2022, the European Commission issued a proposal for a regulation on the EHDS. The TEHDAS results laid the groundwork for the proposal and the implementation of the regulation.I would like to thank all TEHDAS partners for their hard work and express my gratitude to the member states, the European Commission, stakeholders and external advisors for their valuable input. The impact of the TEHDAS project can be seen in the EHDS proposal, which will benefit Europe for decades to come, explains Markus Kalliola, Project Director at Sitra, who led the European collaborative project.
Towards EHDS in collaboration
The legislative process is in full swing. Negotiations are ongoing in the European Parliament and in the Council of the European Union. The final legal text is expected in 2024 and, once adopted, will enter into force after a transitional period.The work towards better health and care is not yet complete, but thanks to the TEHDAS project, the secondary use of health data in the EU has taken a major step forward. This work will continue, focusing on the successful implementation of the EHDS, which will require broad collaboration throughout Europe.The TEHDAS joint action, funded by the EU and 25 countries, ended this July. A follow-up joint action is planned to begin in mid-2024.This TEHDAS report summarises the main findings of the project in a single document to serve European health data stakeholders and the public.







European Health Data Space (EHDS)
The aim is to make it easier to use European health data across borders for patient care, research, policymaking and innovation, such as developing new treatments.
The European Commission published a proposal for a regulation on a common European Health Data Space, where health data can be accessed securely and seamlessly across national borders.
The negotiations on the proposal are ongoing at the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament.
The use of health data is expected to improve care and strengthen the health sector in Europe.

        Published on 02.02.2024
      

        02.02.2024
      

TEHDAS2 project application submitted
The follow-up joint action to the TEHDAS project called the Second joint action towards the European health data space, TEHDAS2, is moving forward. The project proposal was submitted to the European Commission on 1 February 2024. The project is expected to start in May.
The TEHDAS2 is a project of 30 EU countries with the mission to bring together the best current knowledge in order to develop, in active cooperation, guidelines and technical specifications for common use by all members states and the Commission for the implementation of the European health data space (EHDS) on the secondary use of health data. The main objective of the joint action is to prepare the ground for the harmonised implementation of common measures, enabling the secondary use of health data in the proposed EHDS.
The project has been in a planning phase since October 2023. The planning phase has now been completed and the project application was submitted to the European Commission on 1 February. Once the application has been evaluated the project is expected to start on 1 May 2024.

Sitra has been appointed to lead a project of 29 countries to realise the European health data space
The European Union is facilitating the safe use of health data across borders to develop new treatments and medicines. Sitra-led TEHDAS joint action conducted the preparatory work on the European health data space (EHDS). Member states selected Sitra on 12 October 2023 to coordinate further work in the EU. 
The Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra has been selected to lead EU member states joint action on preparing for the reuse of health data as proposed in the EHDS. The countries that signed up for the collaboration made the selection.Each member state nominated the organisations that will participate in the project. The member states will work in collaboration with the European Commission to promote the EHDS.
The new project supports the successful realisation of the EHDS, where data would be available securely on demand across borders for patient care (primary use) and for secondary purposes such as research, innovation and policymaking. The foundations and ideas for the EU-wide secondary use of health data were developed and promoted in the joint action Towards the European Health Data Space (TEHDAS) that was also led by Sitra.
I would like to thank the member states for their confidence in Sitra. It is a privilege to continue to build on TEHDAS work and contribute to the development of the health sector in Europe together with the member states, says Markus Kalliola, Project Director from Sitra.
The new joint action under the EUs fourth Health Programme (EU4Health) will start in 2024 with the participation of 29 European countries. The budget is 6.7 million euros of which 60 per cent is financed by the EU and 40 per cent by the countries.
EU4Health funds and supports cooperation between EU countries and promotes harmonised approaches.More information on ways to participate in the joint action will be available on the  website as the project progresses.

Data altruism is about the sharing and use of data for the benefit of all, thereby making new data sources available for research and innovation. TEHDAS has developed recommendations to enable voluntary data sharing for the European health data space.

A recent report by the EU joint action Towards the European Health Data Space (TEHDAS) presents recommendations for policymakers at the EU and national level, and data altruism organisations on how to involve individuals in data sharing  data altruism  in the European health data space (EHDS).Data altruism refers to people and organisations who voluntarily make data available in the public interest, thereby enabling new sources of data for secondary purposes such as research and innovation, without seeking reward. An example is health data gathered by an individuals smartwatch or other smart devices. Data altruism organisations make data available on a large scale in accordance with the principles of data altruism.The report argues that there is a need to encourage individual involvement in the EHDS and especially in data altruism. Transparency, trust and citizen empowerment are crucial elements for public acceptance. Without voluntary data sharing by individuals, there will not be enough rich data available for research, innovation and decision-making.The report makes recommendations on how to adopt and harmonise the identified good practices for building national or European health data spaces. The recommendations include:

Supporting digital literacy in the society. The shift towards digital tools such as smart devices or health applications for gathering and analysing health data demands attention to digital skills. Neglecting this could damage public trust.
Data altruism organisations should provide incentives to encourage individuals and groups to participate in making health data available for public interest, such as scientific research. These incentives could include informing individuals about how their data has been used and the results of that use, and recognising their contributions.
Data altruism organisations should ensure that high-quality and unbiased data is accessible and available. The report also recommends that they cooperate with academic institutions, non-profits and charities to share best practices.
The public and private sectors should increase collaboration to provide richer datasets for research.
Guidelines for data altruism should be prepared in cooperation with a wide range of stakeholders, such as data altruism organisations, data holders and private sector organisations. The Data Governance Act defines that common rules need to be developed for data altruism organisations, such as a common consent form.
Trust on health data altruism organisations depends on their accountability. An essential element for building trust is citizens and patients control over their data, as well as transparency about how and with whom health data is shared, and what the benefits and risks of data sharing are.

The recommendations are based on applicable legal instruments, especially the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Data Governance Act (DGA) and the EHDS, and they are in line with the views of stakeholders.This concludes the work of TEHDAS on data altruism.



The report has been approved by the project steering group. The European Commission gives final approval to all joint actions deliverables.

TEHDAS recommendations to EU and member states to ensure EHDS sustainability
The European Union and its member states are starting to share health data. This will require long-term efforts both at national and EU level, covering all aspects of sustainability, including long-term funding.
A new report of the joint action Towards the European Health Data Space (TEHDAS) concludes that the sustainability of the European health data space (EHDS) for the secondary use of health data has several dimensions in addition to funding and financing. These include establishing a legal basis and governance, ensuring access to quality data, capacity and competence, as well as trust.The report gives an overview of the EU funding options for the EHDS, examines examples from Finland, France and the Netherlands, discusses the sharing of costs between data holders, health data access bodies and data users, and looks at the available information on cost chargeable to users.The report provides 38 recommendations for member states and the EU to address these different dimensions of EHDS sustainability.The recommendations on funding include:The Commission and member states should ensure a smooth interaction between the EHDS regulation and other legislation affecting data use, both in terms of EU-level legislation, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Act, as well as national-level legislation. This should be supported by an EU-funded network of future health data access bodies in member states.Member states and the EU need to agree on the cost-sharing principles for cross-border use of health data. The EU should use varied funding instruments for EU-level work, and consider a later option for the stable maintenance of the central services.The member states need to set up roadmaps that consider the investments in their own national systems to make the health data accessible.The resource needs should be alleviated by producing open-source tools for the use by member states in European collaboration funded by various EU programmes.Funding by the EU and member states is needed for many actions, such as ensuring broad stakeholder engagement to build trust and to communicate the benefits of the secondary use of health data.TEHDAS hopes that the member states and the Commission will benefit from the recommendations when developing plans for the secondary use of health data.This concludes the work of TEHDAS on the sustainability of secondary use of data in the EHDS.



The report has been approved by the project steering group. The European Commission gives final approval to all joint actions deliverables.
