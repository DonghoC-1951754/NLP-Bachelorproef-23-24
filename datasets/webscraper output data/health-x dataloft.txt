VISION/MISSION

				Secure digitization of health data
			

Future healthcare will increasingly rely on secure data networking across multiple sectors.


Today, data from primary health care, such as hospitals and doctors' offices, are securely stored there. However, it usually still experiences a low level of digitization and is rarely shared and integrated across the boundaries of facilities and sectors. With the electronic patient file (ePA) and the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII), the German Federal Ministries BMG and BMBF have launched pioneering concepts to break through the isolation of data and enable their linkage.



























































































VISION/MISSION

				Sovereignty over personal health data
			

In the secondary health care market, personal health data such as vitality data are becoming more and more important due to a variety of different consumer devices.


Compared to clinical data, these data, such as information on step count or sleep rhythm, provide a continuous picture of personal health, collected under everyday conditions and potentially available over many years and decades.


In this way, they differ from clinical assessments, which are generally more precise but are collected only at very specific points in time and at great expense. Therefore, in combination with clinical health data, they offer huge potential for healthcare, from prevention to intervention to follow-up.



However, in a digital market of health tracking devices dominated by international companies, the rights to the data and the analysis of the data are mostly outside Europe  there is a threat of a massive sell-out of German or European health data, as has already taken place in the social media sector.

HEALTH  X dataLOFT Platform





















Our approach aims to put citizens at the center of the distribution, use, and control of their own health data from the two health markets.















HEALTHX dataLOFT PLATFORM

				What is dataLOFT?
			

Based on the decision of citizens, health data will be implemented in a legitimized, open and federated dataLOFT Platform and made accessible according to Gaia-X standards.


The data platforms and integrated services which are to be developed shall enable the individual use of data and develop individual business models for the German-European health industry.
The objective is to develop transparent cloud-based applications in the healthcare market with leading representatives in highly relevant areas of healthcare.
For the networking of health care areas and the integrative use of data, the concepts of the MII for data exchange across the borders of institutions and locations as well as legally binding Gematik standards and solutions of the telematics infrastructure will be integrated. Central to HEALTH-X are the new economic business models that result from the data sovereignty of citizens and patients as donors of health data and from the linking of data areas that were previously predominantly separate and could not be jointly evaluated.














































HEALTHX dataLOFT PLATFORM

				Putting the patient first
			

Unlike existing offerings, our data room will be citizen/patient centric: Citizens/patients will have access to and control over their personal health data, regardless of its origin.


In this way, these data can be made available for personal health concerns, medical care and research based on self-determined legitimization by the citizens/patients themselves.
Complementary to the existing classic offerings in vendor-bound silos, we are developing a vendor-neutral platform to enable access to and integration of data from the first and second health markets. This platform enables new usage approaches and business models for device manufacturers, service providers, and clinical care providers. This new ecosystem is open, federated, and based on the standards being developed under the Gaia-X project.















HEALTHX dataLOFT PLATFORM

				Diverse Use Cases
			

Our Use Cases are from the first and second health markets, which offer citizens/patients an improvement in preventive care and during treatment, as well as the possibility to participate in research projects.










				Innovation Hub
			

In the course of the project, we will establish further Use Cases in the Innovation Hub, with which the dataLOFT platform will be tested for its promise of benefit for citizens and patients as well as for the development of innovative business models in the first and second health market.







































HEALTHX dataLOFT PLATFORM

				Transparent access and control
			

In contrast to the classic offers, the possibility is offered from the outset for customers to have transparent access to and control over the collected manufacturer-independent data, which can then also be used in regulated health research and health care.


A protected, personally designed data room concept is used for this purpose. Based on the personal data room with a consistently designed consent concept from the first recording of health data and using Gaia-X Federated Services, a transparent linking and use of health data is made possible in a way that is not possible today.


































"In HEALTH-X dataLOFT you change from a simple beneficiary of services to a determining and active partner. You get sovereignty over your health data and decide what happens to your sensitive data, how it is used and who is allowed to use it."

Use Cases




















USE CASES

				Hidden potentials - our health data enables new business models
			

HEALTH-X dataLOFT demonstrates in four use cases the opportunities that arise from combining healthcare data from the primary and secondary healthcare markets.


This creates completely new business models. The Use Cases address socially highly relevant questions about strengthening the role of citizens, health prevention, healthy aging, and clinical care, where the core question of who finances the "therapy of the healthy" finds new answers in presented B2P and B2C models. dataLOFT achieves high visibility and broad impact in Germany and Europe through the solutions presented.















USE CASE 1

				Self-determined everyday health
			

With the increasing popularity of wearables, fitness wristbands, smartwatches, sports watches, networked scales, health apps, and many more, the casual monitoring of many parameters of the own health has become commonplace over many years, even for healthy people.


The aim of Use Case 1 is to make the treasury of data from all these devices available for prevention and health maintenance, for healthy aging in everyday life, and medical diagnostics and therapy. By connecting and networking long-term self-tracking in everyday life, medical device-specific relevant data from the primary health care market (e.g., from implants), and ePA data, new health services will be enabled and made fundable by the statutory health insurance system.
For manufacturers of self-tracking devices, the secondary use of tracking data opens up new business areas not only in the secondary health markets, but also in the primary health market, which is difficult for them to reach today. Financing is possible as both individual services privately and as prevention, care or bonus offers from the health insurance funds. Direct monetization (e.g., as DiGA, DiPA, or DiVA, possibly with private co-payment in premium models), as well as indirect monetization (e.g., through X-as-a-Service models and study design), is conceivable through the providers of new health services, who act as trusted intermediaries between end customers, device manufacturers, and smart service providers.































































































USE CASE 2

				Clinical Accompaniment
			

Here, prototypical oncological treatment scenarios are developed based on the ePA and its connected dataLOFT data areas and services.


The interdisciplinary and intersectoral care of cancer patients requires a comprehensive collection and linking of diagnostic and clinical data, which will be supplemented in the future by the integration of patient-centered sensor technology and home-ambulatory monitoring. The cross-sector integration and analysis of these data using certified AI methods open up new opportunities for individualized patient education ("shared decision-making") and personalized therapy recommendations.
The integration of Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) and Patient-Reported Experiences (PREs) will provide important complements to standard outcome measures in the clinic. Of central importance is the integration of large-volume image data from radiology and pathology, which - linked to ePA findings and Patient-Reported Outcomes - will significantly improve patient care and can be fed into the application of AI-based tools. These improvements in patient care will allow funding of such use cases by health insurers in different B2P models, either as part of standard care or selectively as a DiVA of a SHI.















USE CASE 3

				Personalized health services
			

HEALTH-X dataLOFT enables the linking of the different data domains after data is released by the citizens for services, such as the AI-based assistant as an adaptive, personalized system for a variety of specific concrete applications.


These include, for example, checking the compatibility of medications based on personal genetic background, the prevention or treatment of back pain, and as planned in the Gaia-X use case "Smart Health Connect", the early detection of acute health problems in the case of cardiovascular disease.

































































































USE CASE 4

				Secondary use of data
			

Linking longitudinal everyday data with clinical and diagnostic data holds significant potential for disease understanding, prevention, and personalized health.


Here, we demonstrate how the concepts of dataLOFT will allow citizens to donate selected clinical and image data to selected research infrastructures in pseudonymized or anonymized form. For image data, a data minimization tool developed for selected clinical data donation is used. A mobile data donation app will be provided, with full integration of consent granting, customization, and revocation functions via the dataLOFT Data Wallet.
Other functionalities relate to pseudonymization, harmonization, and transfer of highly diverse health data, as well as the provision of clinical image data from radiology, and pathology to the clinical data area of dataLOFT. The exploitation of the app and the data donation service will involve Gaia-X IAM services in different B2B models. The applications will be offered to research data platforms, for example, as a function-as-a-service with optional customization and training.
Infrastructures developed in this use case will also be evaluated in dataLOFT for exploratory projects of our partners for innovative analysis and as-a-service offerings.


















HEALTH-XUse Cases


























Other significant exploitation opportunities arise from the components and infrastructures used across several of the previously mentioned use cases and potentially in future dataLOFT applications as well as in other Gaia-X domains.


















USE CASE

				General Use and Exploitation
			

Further significant exploitation opportunities arise from the components and infrastructures that areused across several of the aforementioned use cases and potentially in future dataLOFT applicationsas well as in other Gaia-X domains:


Bundesdruckerei provides the ID management and data trust service as a B2B service and infrastructure component. This component will initially be implemented as a free basic and infrastructure service. The provision as fee-based, individually adaptable B2B additional services, paid by third-party providers, e.g. as a "white label solution", is an example of further options.
Part of the dataLOFT platform is a federated infrastructure to enable citizens to manage all their own personal data. This is where B2B services are created, in which companies are given development know-how and access to the infrastructure. The use of connector technologies enables the connection of diagnostic patient data collected in the clinical setting through research, development, and deployment of a secure, Gaia-X compliant platform. Interfaces allow basic access to data from the ePA and prepare this information according to the patient's wishes for new patient and doctor portals.
A special feature of our concept is that we can use the tools of the HEALTH-X Innovation Hub to respond to new requirements and needs of citizens and the market in an agile manner by introducing new concepts, developments and products in HEALTH-X into the to integrate the overall concept.

HEALTH  X dataLOFT Platform





















Our approach aims to put citizens at the center of the distribution, use, and control of their own health data from the two health markets.















HEALTHX dataLOFT PLATFORM

				What is dataLOFT?
			

Based on the decision of citizens, health data will be implemented in a legitimized, open and federated dataLOFT Platform and made accessible according to Gaia-X standards.


The data platforms and integrated services which are to be developed shall enable the individual use of data and develop individual business models for the German-European health industry.
The objective is to develop transparent cloud-based applications in the healthcare market with leading representatives in highly relevant areas of healthcare.
For the networking of health care areas and the integrative use of data, the concepts of the MII for data exchange across the borders of institutions and locations as well as legally binding Gematik standards and solutions of the telematics infrastructure will be integrated. Central to HEALTH-X are the new economic business models that result from the data sovereignty of citizens and patients as donors of health data and from the linking of data areas that were previously predominantly separate and could not be jointly evaluated.














































HEALTHX dataLOFT PLATFORM

				Putting the patient first
			

Unlike existing offerings, our data room will be citizen/patient centric: Citizens/patients will have access to and control over their personal health data, regardless of its origin.


In this way, these data can be made available for personal health concerns, medical care and research based on self-determined legitimization by the citizens/patients themselves.
Complementary to the existing classic offerings in vendor-bound silos, we are developing a vendor-neutral platform to enable access to and integration of data from the first and second health markets. This platform enables new usage approaches and business models for device manufacturers, service providers, and clinical care providers. This new ecosystem is open, federated, and based on the standards being developed under the Gaia-X project.















HEALTHX dataLOFT PLATFORM

				Diverse Use Cases
			

Our Use Cases are from the first and second health markets, which offer citizens/patients an improvement in preventive care and during treatment, as well as the possibility to participate in research projects.










				Innovation Hub
			

In the course of the project, we will establish further Use Cases in the Innovation Hub, with which the dataLOFT platform will be tested for its promise of benefit for citizens and patients as well as for the development of innovative business models in the first and second health market.







































HEALTHX dataLOFT PLATFORM

				Transparent access and control
			

In contrast to the classic offers, the possibility is offered from the outset for customers to have transparent access to and control over the collected manufacturer-independent data, which can then also be used in regulated health research and health care.


A protected, personally designed data room concept is used for this purpose. Based on the personal data room with a consistently designed consent concept from the first recording of health data and using Gaia-X Federated Services, a transparent linking and use of health data is made possible in a way that is not possible today.


































"In HEALTH-X dataLOFT you change from a simple beneficiary of services to a determining and active partner. You get sovereignty over your health data and decide what happens to your sensitive data, how it is used and who is allowed to use it."

Use Cases




















USE CASES

				Hidden potentials - our health data enables new business models
			

HEALTH-X dataLOFT demonstrates in four use cases the opportunities that arise from combining healthcare data from the primary and secondary healthcare markets.


This creates completely new business models. The Use Cases address socially highly relevant questions about strengthening the role of citizens, health prevention, healthy aging, and clinical care, where the core question of who finances the "therapy of the healthy" finds new answers in presented B2P and B2C models. dataLOFT achieves high visibility and broad impact in Germany and Europe through the solutions presented.















USE CASE 1

				Self-determined everyday health
			

With the increasing popularity of wearables, fitness wristbands, smartwatches, sports watches, networked scales, health apps, and many more, the casual monitoring of many parameters of the own health has become commonplace over many years, even for healthy people.


The aim of Use Case 1 is to make the treasury of data from all these devices available for prevention and health maintenance, for healthy aging in everyday life, and medical diagnostics and therapy. By connecting and networking long-term self-tracking in everyday life, medical device-specific relevant data from the primary health care market (e.g., from implants), and ePA data, new health services will be enabled and made fundable by the statutory health insurance system.
For manufacturers of self-tracking devices, the secondary use of tracking data opens up new business areas not only in the secondary health markets, but also in the primary health market, which is difficult for them to reach today. Financing is possible as both individual services privately and as prevention, care or bonus offers from the health insurance funds. Direct monetization (e.g., as DiGA, DiPA, or DiVA, possibly with private co-payment in premium models), as well as indirect monetization (e.g., through X-as-a-Service models and study design), is conceivable through the providers of new health services, who act as trusted intermediaries between end customers, device manufacturers, and smart service providers.































































































USE CASE 2

				Clinical Accompaniment
			

Here, prototypical oncological treatment scenarios are developed based on the ePA and its connected dataLOFT data areas and services.


The interdisciplinary and intersectoral care of cancer patients requires a comprehensive collection and linking of diagnostic and clinical data, which will be supplemented in the future by the integration of patient-centered sensor technology and home-ambulatory monitoring. The cross-sector integration and analysis of these data using certified AI methods open up new opportunities for individualized patient education ("shared decision-making") and personalized therapy recommendations.
The integration of Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) and Patient-Reported Experiences (PREs) will provide important complements to standard outcome measures in the clinic. Of central importance is the integration of large-volume image data from radiology and pathology, which - linked to ePA findings and Patient-Reported Outcomes - will significantly improve patient care and can be fed into the application of AI-based tools. These improvements in patient care will allow funding of such use cases by health insurers in different B2P models, either as part of standard care or selectively as a DiVA of a SHI.















USE CASE 3

				Personalized health services
			

HEALTH-X dataLOFT enables the linking of the different data domains after data is released by the citizens for services, such as the AI-based assistant as an adaptive, personalized system for a variety of specific concrete applications.


These include, for example, checking the compatibility of medications based on personal genetic background, the prevention or treatment of back pain, and as planned in the Gaia-X use case "Smart Health Connect", the early detection of acute health problems in the case of cardiovascular disease.

































































































USE CASE 4

				Secondary use of data
			

Linking longitudinal everyday data with clinical and diagnostic data holds significant potential for disease understanding, prevention, and personalized health.


Here, we demonstrate how the concepts of dataLOFT will allow citizens to donate selected clinical and image data to selected research infrastructures in pseudonymized or anonymized form. For image data, a data minimization tool developed for selected clinical data donation is used. A mobile data donation app will be provided, with full integration of consent granting, customization, and revocation functions via the dataLOFT Data Wallet.
Other functionalities relate to pseudonymization, harmonization, and transfer of highly diverse health data, as well as the provision of clinical image data from radiology, and pathology to the clinical data area of dataLOFT. The exploitation of the app and the data donation service will involve Gaia-X IAM services in different B2B models. The applications will be offered to research data platforms, for example, as a function-as-a-service with optional customization and training.
Infrastructures developed in this use case will also be evaluated in dataLOFT for exploratory projects of our partners for innovative analysis and as-a-service offerings.


















HEALTH-XUse Cases


























Other significant exploitation opportunities arise from the components and infrastructures used across several of the previously mentioned use cases and potentially in future dataLOFT applications as well as in other Gaia-X domains.


















USE CASE

				General Use and Exploitation
			

Further significant exploitation opportunities arise from the components and infrastructures that areused across several of the aforementioned use cases and potentially in future dataLOFT applicationsas well as in other Gaia-X domains:


Bundesdruckerei provides the ID management and data trust service as a B2B service and infrastructure component. This component will initially be implemented as a free basic and infrastructure service. The provision as fee-based, individually adaptable B2B additional services, paid by third-party providers, e.g. as a "white label solution", is an example of further options.
Part of the dataLOFT platform is a federated infrastructure to enable citizens to manage all their own personal data. This is where B2B services are created, in which companies are given development know-how and access to the infrastructure. The use of connector technologies enables the connection of diagnostic patient data collected in the clinical setting through research, development, and deployment of a secure, Gaia-X compliant platform. Interfaces allow basic access to data from the ePA and prepare this information according to the patient's wishes for new patient and doctor portals.
A special feature of our concept is that we can use the tools of the HEALTH-X Innovation Hub to respond to new requirements and needs of citizens and the market in an agile manner by introducing new concepts, developments and products in HEALTH-X into the to integrate the overall concept. In this way we ensure that the consortium can react flexibly to new developments in the extended HEALTH-X community. The governance and financing structure allows us to react flexibly here by consistently using the stakeholder boards and the HEALTH-X General Assembly.

Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing: A Systematic Review and Future Research Directions



						25.04.2024 13:04
					



Data sharing plays a vital role both in advancing scientific research and improving business success through the creation of data-driven product and service innovations. However, privacy concerns often limit the accessibility and utility of sensitive data. To address this challenge, synthetic data generation using Generative Adversarial Networks and Autoencoders has emerged as a promising approach. This paper presents a systematic literature review that explores the current research space of synthetic data sharing for privacy preservation. The systematic literature review encompasses methods, evaluation approaches, applications, domains, and scientific fields related to privacy-preserving synthetic data sharing. The vast majority of the selected 66 papers focus on sharing synthetic medical data, indicating a research gap for other domains. The findings of this study provide insights for Information Systems researchers to contribute to the advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence for data ecosystems and highlight potential research directions.

The Symphony of Orchestrated Participatory Data Space Governance: A Systematic Review



						25.04.2024 13:04
					



While digital platforms lead to societal progress through broadening information access, they started to face criticism for creating winner-takes-all dynamics and enforcing rules that cause societal inequalities. This prompted European policymakers to introduce initiatives and regulations that establish data spaces. We systematically reviewed 874 data space publications from three databases, focusing on their governance configuration. We found that data space literature is fragmented, lacks conceptual clarity, and considers governance aspects in isolation. First, we contribute by providing a holistic definition and deriving a refined conceptual understanding. We define data spaces as platform ecosystems built on federated infrastructures and participatory governance configurations for sovereign data exchange oriented toward distributing decision rights between stakeholders. Second, building on IS literature on platform ecosystem governance, we characterize the governance of data spaces along seven dimensions, highlighting their participatory design. This provides the foundation for a nuanced discussion on data spaces and future research areas.
