About


The National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR)
The NIHR aims to improve the health and wealth of the UK through research. Its mission is to provide a health research system in which the NHS supports outstanding individuals working in world-class facilities, conducting leading-edge research focused on the needs of patients and the public.
The NIHR supports research from laboratory bench to bedside for the benefit of patients and the economy. It works with patients and the public to shape the research agenda, finding new ways of preventing, identifying and treating ill health, evaluating the effectiveness and impact of new healthcare treatments, and ensures that the best possible evidence is available to inform decisions about health and social care.
The NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC)
The NIHR HIC is a collaboration between NHS trusts, each of which has a strong relationship with a partner university. These relationships have been strengthened and supported by the NIHR, in particular through the establishment of NIHR Biomedical Research Centres (BRCs) within each trust. It is the BRCs that provide the focal points for the NIHR HIC, bringing together clinical, scientific, and informatics expertise at each trust to improve the quality and availability of patient information.
The aims of the NIHR HIC are to:

support the establishment and maintenance of catalogued, comparable, comprehensive flows of patient data at each trust:

catalogued, in that the context of collection, the intended interpretation, or the provenance of the data is properly recorded and understood.
comparable, in that unnecessary differences in the way in which data is recorded, processed, and represented are reduced or eliminated.
comprehensive, in that the flows contain all of the core information needed for high quality care, service evaluation, and translational research.


to create a governance framework for data sharing and re-use across the trusts and partner organisations, including:

a data sharing agreement, allowing for the transfer of deidentified and/or identified information between trusts.
a publication policy, ensuring that contributors across the collaborative receive appropriate credit.
a shared approach to research collaboration and intellectual property, streamlining the process of data re-use for scientific progress and patient benefit.




An additional aim is to demonstrate this new capability  the data flows and the governance framework  through the delivery of a number of exemplar research studies, one in each of the established therapeutic areas.
The NIHR HIC trusts
The NIHR HIC is formed of NHS trusts, some with a university partner:
Trust and Health BoardUniversityUniversity of Liverpool Queen Mary University of LondonUniversity of ManchesterUniversity of CambridgeCardiff UniversityImperial College LondonUniversity College London Institute of Child HealthKings College LondonHull UniversityImperial College LondonKings College LondonUniversity of LiverpoolUniversity of ManchesterUCL Institute of OphthalmologyUniversity of GlasgowUniversity of NottinghamUniversity of OxfordUniversity of Oxford The Institute of Cancer ResearchUniversity of SheffieldUniversity College LondonUniversity of BirminghamUniversity of BristolUniversity of LeicesterUniversity of Southampton University College London

The NIHR HIC benefits
More effective use of electronic patient records
Electronic patient records hold detailed information about patients life circumstances, their medical history, and the treatment they receive. This information is needed by frontline healthcare professionals for the delivery and continuity of care. When collected together, it is also extremely useful to health planners in assessing what services are needed, and what improvements could be made, and by researchers working to turn scientific progress into patient benefit.
By improving the quality, availability and consistency of electronic patient records nationally, the NIHR HIC contributes to improving patient outcomes, reducing the costs of care and accelerating health research and service improvements.
Improving the ability to draw comparisons from research and analysis
Patient information is captured in different settings and held in different ways, but in order to be able to draw reliable research conclusions it is vital to be able to compare like with like. The NIHR HIC is helping to check that data can be sensibly compared by creating different data models across the patient experience, from initial diagnosis to eventual outcome. This helps to identify ways in which data may need to be adapted to enable effective comparison and provide more assurance that conclusions are sound. 
Making information held easier to find and use
There is a wealth of information available about the diagnosis of patients, their treatment over a period of time, and the outcomes that they experience. A key challenge for researchers is that this information is held in many different IT systems, which need to work together to provide the fullest picture of what has happened, and what has been effective or not. The NIHR HIC is working on ways to pool data from operational systems into central stores more effectively, and develop different tools and techniques to review, analyse, standardise and present the data in different and more useful, clinically effective ways.
Better opportunities to link with other public organisations, charities, academic organisations and industry to improve patient outcomes
Effective research by companies such as those making medicines and medical equipment is vital for improving treatments and outcomes for patients. There is a real opportunity to enhance the work of these companies by making available high quality and relevant clinical data, which has been collected in standard ways to help comparison. Through the NIHR HIC, prospective research partners are able to work with its members to determine the feasibility of specific studies.
A key benefit is the ability to combine the patient populations across the different organisations for each research theme. Where a study is feasible and ethical approval is obtained, the ability to form patient groups rapidly across multiple organisations, and to draw some or even all the clinical data required from existing information systems, greatly reduces the cost and timelines of execution of research projects.

Governance

Protecting information is vitally important to the NHS trusts that make up the NIHR HIC. These trusts work together to ensure that your data is protected at every step of the journey and is only used legally and appropriately.
Each trust collects and processes data about patients they look after, allowing them to provide the best possible care. Each organisation that collects personal data on the patients they treat is known as a data controller. This means they are responsible for looking after personal data and deciding how it can be processed (or used) to enable the NHS to provide the best service possible. Each trust has a legal obligation to keep your information secure and ensure that it is used appropriately.
Any time data is used for research or other activities as part of the NIHR HIC the trusts involved ensure that your information is processed securely and appropriately by always making sure that the data controllers (trusts responsible for the data) agree and sign off that that they are happy for patient data to be used in this way.
An important objective of the NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative was to develop a governance framework that could be used by NHS trusts to support data sharing in a wide range of research collaborations. Such a framework has been created and any NHS trust that has joined the Collaborative can use it to support the sharing of data. The Collaborative does not oblige any NHS trust to share any data and leaves it to each individual NHS trust to identify any data that it wishes to share. In addition, before sharing any data, the individual NHS trust must be satisfied that it is authorised to share that data. All of the research collaborations that benefit from using the framework developed by the Collaborative have the ultimate aim of improving treatments and outcomes for patients.
Each trust is required to provide a privacy notice that explains how and what they will do with data.

Metadata

Metadata
In order for NHS Trusts to effectively collaborate on the re-use of routine clinical data in a research context, a number of tools and techniques have been built and implemented by the Health Informatics Collaborative. A key problem is the management of metadata: information that describes how a particular item of data has been collected, stored, and may be re-used.Context may be given to each question in a form, each column in a database or spreadsheet, or each field in a database query, making the data easier to understand and avoiding miscommunications and errors being made.
Metadata Catalogue
The metadata catalogue is central to our ability to record metadata about large datasets across a large number of centres. It is a tool that provides astandard way for recording information about data standards, data assets, data flows, terminologies, and phenotypes. Much of the information can be time-consuming to enter manually, so the tool speeds up this process by automating this documentation wherever possible, and allowing content to be collaboratively maintained by those with technical, clinical, or research-user viewpoints.
The following video explains the purpose of the Metadata Catalogue and what it can do:

Themes

The development of the NIHR HIC capability has focused on key therapeutic areas, chosen for their importance to patients and the NHS and also for the different challenges that they present in terms of data quality and availability:

COVID-19
cardiovascular medicine (formerly acute coronary syndromes) 
critical care
ovarian cancer
renal disease (formerly renal transplantation)
viral hepatitis and liver disease
cancer: breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate  
infectious diseases 
hearing health
musculoskeletal
myeloma

Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC)
Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) 
National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN) 
UK Research Reserve (UKRR) 
Bloomsbury institute of Intensive Care Medicine (BiICM)
Myeloma UK

In each theme, clinicians, scientists, and informaticians from the partner organisations work together to deliver the NIHR HIC capability  the data flows and the governance framework  and to demonstrate that capability through exemplar research studies.
Each of the themes is led by a different university-hospital partnership:

, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NIHR HIC Cardiovascular Medicine Theme has been leading on a data collaboration to allow cardiovascular questions to be answered in relation to COVID-19. The work has been prioritised by the NIHR/BHF Cardiovascular Partnership, connecting the cross-BRC collaboration to the network of BHF Centres and Accelerators.

Cancer: Colorectal



Treatments are surgery, neoadjuvant radiotherapy (for patients with rectal cancer), and adjuvant chemotherapy (for patients with stage III/IV and high-risk stage II colon cancer). 5-year relative survival ranges from 90% in patients with early stage disease to 10% in patients with end stage disease. Colorectal screening has been shown to reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. 1.1 million patients are diagnosed with colorectal cancer every year. Incidence is closely related to western lifestyle and increases with age.
Aims of the NIHR HIC
The aim of the project is to collect detailed information from eight of the UKs major colorectal cancer centres. This information will provide a significant data resource outside of a clinical trial setting, to help our understanding of the factors that are important in the outcome of patients presented with colorectal cancer, which helps the development of new and improved treatments and medicines.

Cancer: Breast


Breast cancer is the most common cancer and accounts for 15% of all new cases of cancer in the UK (source: Cancer Research UK 2013)
The NIHR HIC breast cancer theme is led by Dr Elinor Sawyer from Guys and St Thomas Hospital / Kings College London and Dr Richard Baird from the Cambridge Cancer Centre. They are working with other breast cancer experts in the UK through their BRCs Centres and the NIHR HIC to securely and anonymously share key information on breast cancer diagnosis, treatment and outcomes.
Aims of the NIHR HIC
There are different subtypes of breast cancer that can be categorised by tumour grade, hormone receptor and Her2 expression. The NIHR HIC breast cancer theme will look at the frequency of these different subtypes of breast cancer across the different BRCs to assess whether there is any evidence of an association of certain subtypes with ethnicity and age and whether these two factors influence the type of treatment given or the stage at which the cancer presents.
The NIHR HIC breast cancer theme will also develop tools to analyse mine radiology and histopathology text reports to help establish a robust database on patients with metastatic disease to assess outcomes across the Biomedical Research Centres. Having done this the theme will investigate how many patients are being entered into trials and the use of novel treatments from the cancer drugs fund, and assess response rates to these newer agents.

Cancer: Ovarian


In 2011, the ten year estimated survival rate was only 35% following diagnosis. As with most cancers, an earlier diagnosis results in a better outcome. Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer among women in the UK. Cancer Research UK (CRUK) estimates that 19 women each day are diagnosed with ovarian cancer.
Dr James Brenton, of the CRUK Cambridge Cancer Centre, is working with other ovarian cancer specialists, to share key information on ovarian cancer in order to make recommendations about how diagnosis and treatment can improve survival for women with this type of cancer.
While ovarian cancer is a big health concern in the UK, the number of women looked after at any single NHS facility is too small for reliable studies of the population. Treatments may also differ between hospitals, and it is therefore very important to gather data from different places to understand the best treatments and other factors for long-term survival.
Aims of the NIHR HIC
The specific objectives from the NIHR HIC for treatment of ovarian cancer are to:
Securely and anonymously collect and share data on ovarian cancer patientsReview what information we already have on ovarian cancer and see if they can add to the overall pictureEvaluate how ovarian cancer surgery is carried out and determine which of the different methods best achieve the expected outcomes, eg reaching the five year survival, reducing a recurrence of ovarian cancer, and slowing down the progression of the disease
We aim to keep everyone who is interested in this area up to date and informed of the progress we make. Currently all participating sites have adopted the same process of collecting data on ovarian cancer from initial diagnosis to discharge and beyond. The data that is gathered cannot be linked to the identity of a single patient. Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) has established a secure location for receiving the data from each participating site, and for storing and analysing this information on behalf of the NIHR HIC.

Cancer: Prostate


The NHS has pioneered novel diagnostic and treatment paradigms in prostate cancer. The prostate cancer NIHR HIC theme aims to use the data collected during routine practice and cancer registry submissions to answer important questions in prostate cancer management.
A major lesson learned from the phase 1 project in ovarian cancer was that data completeness and quality varied across centres. This is felt to be due to the particular challenges associated with manual data entry into electronic health records  these include addressing issues with IT, process and clinician engagement.
Aims of the NIHR HIC
The first major aim of the prostate cancer theme is to investigate the current baseline of data collection, using the National Prostate Cancer Audit dataset, before instituting changes to improve data completion. The site leads will act as champions to deliver this change. The team will also work with COSD and Genomics England to improve data collection for these projects. The resulting datasets will afford novel insight into the disease processes underlying prostate cancer.

Cardiovascular


(formally Acute Coronary Syndromes)
The theme initial aims were to investigate Acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS refers to a group of conditions that are due to decreased blood flow in the coronary arteries in the heart. When untreated, part of the heart muscle is unable to function properly or dies. This syndrome is typically caused by a blood clot forming on a narrowing in one or more of the arteries supplying the heart. This makes the artery very narrow and usually causes chest pain at rest.
The disease can range from a tight narrowing  which causes pain but no damage  to a complete blockage causing a major heart attack. This is a common condition and many hundreds of patients attend our major centres every year. Patients often receive invasive treatment to open up the arteries to improve blood flow to the heart muscle and this can save lives.
This theme has collated anonymised clinical information on patients presenting with this condition from five of the UKs major cardiac centres, including Imperial, University College London, St Thomas, Oxford and King College Hospital. data includes information on the state of the arteries and the heart muscle and a measure of the degree of damage to the heart. This information is being used by NHS researchers to help our understanding of the factors that are important in the outcome of patients with acute coronary syndromes and will be publishing first results.
The database has been fully reviewed by the National Research Ethics Service.

Childrens Surgery Outcome Reporting (CSOR)

Half a million children in England and Wales undergo surgery each year. In 2011, the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcomes and Death (NCEPOD) review of childrens surgery in the UK concluded there was room to improve the number of these children that were successfully treated.
Across the UK, there is significant variation in the way children are treated for surgical conditions (conditions which usually, but not always, require an operation). However, at the moment, we do not know which elements of this variation affect how successfully children are treated. 
The NIHR HIC is supporting the CSOR Research Database, which has been established to collect the data that are needed to identify which elements of variation in management affect how successfully children are treated. The database will collect information directly from participating hospitals electronic patient record systems, and link this information with routinely collected sources of data (such as Hospital Episodes Statistics), and parent reported quality of life data. Additionally, the programme aims to provide a mechanism by which hospitals can look in detail at how their practice impacts their outcomes, compare their own practice to that of others, and elements of good practice can be easily identified and shared. 
There are ten hospitals participating in the first five year phase of the CSOR programme, and six conditions (oesophageal atresia, gastroschisis, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, necrotising enterocolitis, posterior urethral valves, and Hirschsprungs disease) that are being included in the research database.
By trying to identify and promote areas of best practice, the CSOR programme will hopefully provide a mechanism for improving the number of children that are successfully treated, as well as improving the experience of children and their carers.
To find out more about the CSOR programme, please visit

Critical Care


A critical illness is any illness that may be a direct threat to life, for example:
Serious infection such as pneumonia or meningitisMajor trauma such as a serious road traffic accidentSerious stroke or heart attackFollowing major surgery
Critically ill patients are usually cared for in Critical Care Units, Intensive Care or High Dependency Units staffed by specialist doctors, nurses and therapists with access to high levels of monitoring (such as continuous blood pressure and oxygen levels) and treatments that allow the critical care teams to rapidly detect and respond to any deterioration.
Critical Care has become increasingly sophisticated over the years and patient survival and outcomes have improved. However less is known about survival beyond hospital. Research as to what treatment works best is difficult, as there are not enough patients with the same critical illness from which to draw significant conclusions. Even with large studies, there is too much variation to always be helpful.
A number of important questions remain unanswered about people who have been treated in critical care. For example:
Does a critical illness have an impact on life span?If there is an impact, is it greater for those having had an infection or following a major accident?Do survivors require more input from hospitals following discharge and how long is that input required?
Aims of the NIHR HIC
The Critical Care theme within the NIHR HIC aims to bring together data for analysis and interpretation to help identify what is known about survival outcomes for people who have received critical care. This will help us to:
Better understand critical illness and the long term effect of our treatments so we can tailor these treatments to individual patientsImprove our understanding of the long term consequences of multiple organ failure and treatment so patients have a better quality of life once discharged.
Participating Critical Care Units display posters about this project and information leaflets are given to all patients (and if appropriate next of kin). A brief video explaining what is involved for those who participate can be viewed in the

Diabetes









Diabetes is one of the most common long-term conditions that is characterised by raised glucose levels, and accounts for almost 10% of NHS expenditure. People living with diabetes access health care services due to a variety of reasons, often related to complications such as heart disease, circulatory problems, and sight loss. Similarly, many people with diabetes also access the NHS for a primary reason unrelated to diabetes, but which may be impacted by having diabetes. For example, elective surgery, obesity related complications, sepsis and mental health problems.
Within hospitals, one in six (18%) beds are occupied by a person with diabetes, who often has to stay for longer and has a greater risk of mortality (6.4%). The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the increased risk (2-3 fold) of mortality from COVID in patients with diabetes, with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia being a significant contributor to poorer outcomes.
The main motivation for forming the diabetes theme within the HIC is to leverage routinely collected data to identify ways in which to reduce the gap in outcomes between people with and without diabetes.
Aims of the NIHR HIC
Many people with complex diabetes, and especially a high proportion of those with type 1 diabetes, receive their routine diabetes care through specialist services linked to hospitals. All of these settings collect a wealth of data on diabetes healthcare episodes, outcomes and procedures. By forming a diabetes HIC theme, we aim to access and utilise unique data that exists within the NHS to generate new knowledge and information around the impact of diabetes, different therapies, and glucose control during admissions that could feed back to the better management of diabetes, to ultimately create better outcomes.
From our understanding of diabetes care and the current knowledge gaps, we propose to develop a research database of anonymised real world data to be used as a resource by approved researchers, academics and medical professionals for the benefit of patients living with diabetes in the UK. Full ethical approval will be sought as part of the project and further information around governance within the NIHR HIC is available .
Collaborating centres
The diabetes HIC theme is being led by Professor Pratik Choudhary at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.

Hearing health

Hearing loss is a major public health problem requiring urgent action: one in six of the UK population (equivalent to 11 million people) lives with hearing loss. This makes hearing loss the most common sort of sensory loss, affecting peoples ability to communicate and function in society.
The World Health Organisation has identified hearing loss as the second leading cause of years lived with disability. Hearing loss increases social isolation and substantially increases the risk of suffering from depression. Recent evidence has shown hearing loss in mid-life is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia.
NHS routine data related to hearing loss takes several forms, including:
records of the adoption of measures and provision of advice for thepreventionof hearing lossnewborn hearing screening records about thedetectionof hearing loss at birthresults of audiometric assessments used to inform thediagnosisof hearing lossdata on the provision, maintenance, and use of hearing devices, including hearing aids and auditory implants, for themanagementof hearing loss and to reduce its impact
While prevention is better than cure there is little understanding of why some people get hearing loss while others do not. A clearer understanding of this process could help develop bespoke preventative strategies for individual patients.
Not everyone who could benefit from a hearing device uses one, and those individuals who do receive a hearing device dont always persist in using them or get the expected benefits. Modern hearing devices now offer the opportunity to collect usage data which in turn, could be used to improve individual management strategies as well as wider clinical practice.Broadening the treatment of hearing loss, based on the discovery of new therapeutic targets and techniques, offers the prospect of protecting and restoring hearing.
Advancing the prevention, detection, diagnosis, and management of hearing loss will be greatly aided by the availability and integration of routinely collected multifaceted health data of patients with hearing loss from across the NHS.
Aims of the theme:
The aim of the Hearing theme is to make better use of patient health data captured in NHS records by collecting data in a standardised and integrated manner across UK sites and setting up a structure for sharing and analysing these data anonymously.These new assemblies of data will allow the growth of more effective management strategies for individuals with hearing loss.The Hearing theme will develop the infrastructure and governance for the management and integration of this hearing health data. This will allow for:
Exploration of the effects of known and novel risk factors such as disease clustering for hearing loss.Identification of the genetic causes of hearing lossDefinition of hearing loss sub-typesOptimisation of patient benefit from individualised treatment strategies

Digital Alerting for Sepsis (DiAlS)
The NIHR HIC are supporting a new study toreview the impact of a digital alert system to monitor patients with sepsis at NHS hospitals. The Digital Alerting for Sepsis (DiAlS) project sets out to explore How effective is the introduction of digital alerts in terms of improving outcomes of patients with sepsis? with four key objectives: 

									Map the digital alerts currently in use in multiple UK hospitals to identify patients at risk of
having sepsis

								
									Evaluate the impact of digital alerts on outcomes for patients at risk of sepsis

								
									Explore the implementation of digital alerts across contexts and the impact of these on digital

									alert performance.

								
									Make recommendations on the effectiveness of different digital alerts and the most effective

									method of implementation.

								
A full summary of the Digital Alerting for Sepsis (DiAlS) project is available  
The research is led by the  based in the School of Public Health at Imperial College London. The team will collaborate with the Oxford University NHS trust, Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust, University College London, Reading and Berkshire NHS Trust, and the University of Cardiff, and is supported by the  and the NIHR HIC.

Musculoskeletal


The theme aims to investigate ways to improve the outcome of musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions.
MSK conditions comprise immune mediated inflammatory diseases affecting the joints and the connective tissues (IMIDs), as well as the most common condition of adulthood, osteoarthritis (OA).
While IMIDs and OA are very different in nature, the common outcome when progressive and untreated is pain and loss of joint function, which can result in poor mobility and inability to work. MSK conditions are the leading cause of disability in UK and a major cost to society. Research into early detection and prevention of damage can have a tremendous impact on the health of the nation and the productivity of our society.
This theme is currently being established and it proposes to collect anonymised clinical information on patients affected by MSK conditions from some of the UKs major MSK centres, including Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Newcastle, Oxford and Bristol. The data collected within the NHS hospital trusts of these centres will be used to measure the impact of the new diagnostic and therapeutic interventions funded by NIHR on the real life outcome of patients with MSK conditions.

Myeloma


Multiple myeloma is a form of blood cancer which is responsible for  approximately 2% of cancers in the UK. The incidence of myeloma increases with age with the average age of diagnosis being 67. It is currently incurable although there have been significant improvements in outcomes over the last decade due to more effective treatments, resulting in a longer life expectancy.Complications of myeloma can include low blood counts, infections, bone disease and kidney failure (end organ damage). Myeloma can be diagnosed on routine blood tests but can also present with features of end organ  damage in an acute setting. Successful treatment aims to prolong life and maintain quality of life with patients frequently having periods of time on and off treatment.
Aims of the NIHR HIC
This NIHR HIC theme is focusing on collecting real world data from people living with myeloma in the UK. Data collected will include diagnostic practices and treatment regimens, in addition to other factors that may have an impact on overall outcomes and well-being. Collecting real world data is becoming increasingly important in many key areas of cancer care. Examples of this may include reviewing the overall provision of care for this patient population, helping newer drug treatments secure long term NHS funding and access to clinical trials. This theme has been established with the support of Myeloma UK, the national charity for patients in the UK living with myeloma, who understand the vital role real-world data has in improving outcomes in addition to ensuring the patient perspective is represented. Further information about the themes partnership with Myeloma UK is available .The NIHR HIC Myeloma theme team will develop a research database of in effect anonymised real world data to be used as a resource by approved researchers, academics and medical professionals working within the myeloma community for the benefit of patients living with myeloma in the UK. Full ethical approval has been awarded as part of the project and further information around governance within the NIHR HIC is available .

Renal Transplantation


Renal Transplantation is the largest of the solid organ transplant programmes with around 3,000 performed annually in the United Kingdom. It is the optimal treatment for patients with end stage kidney disease in terms of survival, quality of life and economic advantages. The limited lifespan of the transplanted kidneys means that multiple transplants are often required which places a burden on patients and restricts the availability of organs for all suitable recipients.
A kidney transplant offers the best treatment for patients with kidney failure, offering better quality of life and survival over long term dialysis, as well as being more economical in the long term. In the United Kingdom, kidney transplantation is the largest of the solid organ transplantation programmes. with over 3000 being performed per year.
A number of barriers to success still remain. Firstly, the number of patients on the waiting list exceeds the number of available organs, leading to strategies to increase organ availability, including widening of criteria for suitable donors and better organ preservation. Unfortunately, a transplanted kidney also has a limited lifespan, with an average life of somewhere between 15-20 years depending on whether the donor was living or deceased. This results in many, particularly younger patients, requiring multiple transplants throughout their life. This is complicated by the fact that it becomes increasing harder to find a match once patients have had a previous transplant. 
Recipients of solid organ transplants are also required to take anti-rejection medication for the life of the transplant but this has its own issues, resulting in increased rates of infection and cancer as well as other drug specific side effects. At present monitoring of the transplanted kidney relies on non-specific measures of kidney function with little detailed information to help guide clinicians as to how much anti-rejection medication a particular individual needs, resulting in a reactive rather than proactive approach.
The outcome following a kidney transplant is determined by a complex interplay between a number of factors. It is therefore an area ripe for a more personalised approach in terms of treatment.In order to better understand the role of specific factors in outcome and carry out translational research in this population, it is important to have high quality clinical data from kidney transplant recipients. As well as allowing research, information on outcomes will also allow clinicians to better inform of patients undergoing transplantation
The NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC) Transplantation Theme is led by the Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre at Guys and St Thomas NHS Trust and Kings College, London. The other BRCs currently taking part are:
Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust and Cambridge UniversityOxford University Hospitals NHS Trust and Oxford UniversityImperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Imperial College, London.
Together a database of nearly 8000 recipients transplanted at these centres since 2010 has been created. Involvement from other renal transplant centres would be welcomed.
Exemplar Project
In order to demonstrate the utility of the dataset, an exemplar project to determine the incidence and factors contributing to the development of glomerulonephritis in transplanted kidneys is being carried out. This project specifically makes use of the collaboration and large dataset given the incidence of a specific glomerulonephritis is relatively low. Preliminary results were presented at the American Society of Transplantation Annual Congress in Seattle in June 2018.
The ongoing plan is to develop further projects using the dataset allowing further enrichment of the dataset.

Transfusion Dependent Anaemias


In the UK, there are approximately 14,000 patients with sickle cell disease (SCD),1,000 patients with thalassaemia (THAL) and2,000patients withmyelodysplasia (MDS). Many of these patients depend on regular  treatment by blood transfusion to prevent a decline in their health or quality of life, although the extent of the dependence varies between individuals. Many other cohorts of patients are intermittently dependent on transfusion e.g. during a period ofmyeloablativechemotherapy.Thehealth of many of these patients depends on access to and the need for blood transfusion, delivered in an emergency or as part of a long-term transfusion programme.Formation of antibodies(alloimmunisation)following blood transfusion is common and severe transfusion reactions can be life-threatening.At present, no real world data are collated on the complex and costly treatment pathways fortransfusion dependent anaemias, including on transfusion requirements, optimal blood matching algorithms, clinical  practice, and complications.
Aims of the NIHR HIC
The project aims to extract dataon transfusion dependent patientsfrom existing electronic data sources in the Englands major transfusion centres. 
In the first instance, the project will collate data from NIHR HIC trusts to populate a data repository and to demonstrate the utility of such data collation for addressing the biological, clinical and economic challenges outlined above.

Viral Hepatitis and Liver Disease



Hepatitis is commonly caused by viral infections that cause inflammation or swelling of the liver. There are four viruses that commonly infect the liver; hepatitis A, B, C and E. Hepatitis D is also well recognised, but only occurs in people that are already infected with hepatitis B.
Hepatitis A and E typically cause acute (short-term) infection and although patients are often unwell at the time, these viruses do not generally persist long-term. In contrast both hepatitis B and C may cause a silent infection for many years, and are often only diagnosed once liver disease is well advanced.
This NIHR HIC theme is focusing on hepatitis B/D, C, and E. Each of these infections brings different challenges to clinicians and researchers in the UK. The epidemiology and risk factors for hepatitis E are very poorly understood in the UK. For hepatitis B the key questions are the factors that predict response to drug treatment, and the role of hepatitis D co-infection. For hepatitis C, treatment has recently undergone a revolution, with many new and effective  but expensive  drugs available to treat patients. Even so, some patients with hepatitis C fail to respond to the newest drugs, and in this theme we will collect data on the outcomes of treatment in these patients.
The NIHR HIC Viral Hepatitis Theme has developed a database of anonymised clinical data:

to address important questions related to clinical outcomes in viral hepatitis
to share clinical data to demonstrate its usefulness in clinical research

The database has been fully reviewed by the National Research Ethics Service.

Engagement

Public Involvement
The NIHR defines public involvement in research as research being carried out with or by members of the public rather than to, about or for them. Examples of public and patient involvement activity include working with researchers to develop or comment on research materials, providing advice as members of a project steering group, and undertaking elements of research e.g. conducting interviews with participants.
Public Engagement
The NIHR defines public engagement as where information and knowledge about research is provided and disseminated. Examples of public engagement activity include disseminating the findings of a study to research participants, colleagues or members of the public, raising awareness of research through media such as television programmes, newspapers and social media and open days at research centres where members of the public are invited to find out about research.
How you can get involved
The NIHR is keen for patients and the public to be actively involved in the work they support as key partners in the research.
If you would like to get involved with research you can get more information from the NIHR by visiting or you can contact your local .
