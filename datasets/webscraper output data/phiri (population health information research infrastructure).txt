PHIRI builds on the achievements of the BRIDGE Health and the Joint Action on Health Information (InfAct) projects.
PHIRI allows for better coordinated European efforts across national and European stakeholders to generate the best available evidence for research on health and
well-being of populations as impacted by COVID-19 to underpin decision making. In doing so, PHIRI lays the foundation for a federated research infrastructure on population health.
PHIRI aims to facilitate and support open, interconnected, and data-driven research through the sharing of cross-country COVID-19 population
health information and exchange of best practices related to identification of data sources, access,assessment and reuse of data on COVID-19
determinants, risk setting and outcomes following ELSI and FAIR principles

PHIRI has launched its Health Information Portal (zie lijn 36) in May 2021, with data sources, population health studies, training material and courses, considering ethical and legal aspects.

In line with the work programmes objectives, PHIRI aims to obtain wider and more efficient access to and use of existing infrastructures in Europe, and to avoid duplication of efforts within and between countries with regards to COVID-19 response. To achieve these objectives, the construction of an integrated, efficient research and innovation environment is necessary. As such, PHIRI will work towards full synergy with different types of actors and initiatives such as European research networks in the domain of population health, relevant national population data owners/ curators, national population health coordination entities, international data collectors and registries relevant for COVID-19 and future epidemics and European research infrastructures. This will come forth in the different work packages set up in this project.

Background





















Health researchers, EU and associated countries, the European Commission and the European Parliament have all clearly stated that structural action to promote and strengthenhealth information is required. As many health information activities operate on a project basis, there is no guaranteed sustainability and integration of the work and achievements delivered by the projects. This became even clearer during the currentpandemic.  COVID-19 has put health systems at a test by impacting all aspects of Europeancitizens' lives in terms of economic security, health systems, physical and mental health, well-being and premature mortality. Now more than ever, a structured European mechanism for COVID-19 exchange of population healthinformation between countries is needed to facilitate multidisciplinary European research and underpin decision making.

The Population Health Information Research Infrastructure

PHIRIaims to generate the best available evidence for research on health and well-being of populations as impacted by COVID-19. PHIRI will allow for better coordinated efforts across national and European stakeholders to generate the best COVID-19 population health knowledge, by enhancing the identification of data sources, access, assessment and reuse of data on COVID-19 determinants, risk setting and outcomes. The project outlines the activities and resources needed to ultimately improve national health information systems and provide an integrated salutation at Europeanlevel, in link with the European Health Data Space and  while ensuring FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse) and ELSI (Ethical, Legal, Social Issues)principles.

Aims
PHIRI aims to facilitate and support open, interconnected, and data-driven research through the sharing of cross-country COVID-19 population health information and exchange of best practices related to data collection, curation, processing, use and reuse of data following ELSI and FAIR principles. The objectives of the project are:

To provide a  with FAIR catalogues on health and health care data for structured information exchange across European countries.
To provide structured exchange between countries on COVID-19 best practices and expertise. 
To promote interoperability and tackle health information inequalities. 


In line with the work programmes objectives, PHIRI aims to obtain wider and more efficient access to and use of existing infrastructures in Europe, and to avoid duplication of efforts within and between countries with regards to COVID-19 response. To achieve these objectives, the construction of an integrated, efficient research and innovation environment is necessary. As such, PHIRI will work towards full synergy with different types of actors and initiatives such as European research networks in the domain of population health, relevant national population data owners/ curators, national population health coordination entities, international data collectors and registries relevant for COVID-19 and future epidemics andEuropean research infrastructures. This will come forth in the different work packages set upin this project.

The Project























Objectives
PHIRI for COVID-19 has the following objectives:

To provide a Health Information portal for COVID-19 with FAIR catalogues on health and health care data for structured information exchange across European countries. It facilitates access to and use of COVID-19 relevant population health (health status and determinants of health) and care data provided by EU countries public health bodies represented in the PHIRI applicant consortium. It provides the services and tools necessary for researchers to link different data sources and to use Pan-European data in a GDPR compliant, federated way.
To provide structured exchange between countries on COVID-19 best practices and expertise. PHIRI shares public health and clinical management information and methodologies identified at national and international level. It allows researchers to provide relevant and evidence based information ready for use in research, and decision-making processes by citizens, clinicians, public health practitioners and policy makers.
To promote interoperability and tackle health information inequalities. PHIRI supports researchers and public health bodies to research queries related to COVID-19 in FAIR and ELSI compliant manners. It provides capacity building for management of COVID-19 relevant population health and healthcare data.


Structure
PHIRI is structured in9 Work Packages (WPs):

WP 1 focus on the coordination and management of the day-to day scientific, administrative and financial aspects of the project.
WP 2 focus on the establishment and implementation of effective communication channels within and outside PHIRI.
WP 3 is responsible for the engagement of key stakeholders at national and international level.
WP 4 aims to build the Health Information portal to facilitate access to health and health care data for COVID-19 between EU countries.
WP 5 focus on supporting European countries in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on population wellbeing and health, morbidity and mortality using a multidisciplinary approach.
WP 6 aims to conduct research through use cases of immediate relevance for public health policies and management of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to facilitate further research by making scalable, reproducible methods available within PHIRI.
WP 7 aims to create and validate a federated research infrastructure that overcomes data reuse & data sharing hindrances for rapid policy relevant research response to the evolving pandemic.
WP 8 aims to establish a sustainable infrastructure to support rapid exchange of information and expertise between actors from competent authorities and researchers in the joint effort to handle the COVID-19 pandemic.
WP 9 aims to gain insights in possible future health impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, by developing scenarios for MS and associated countries national situation.


Methodology
PHIRIs overall methodology is based on the concept developed in the past five year by European countries through BRIDGE Health and InfAct for a research infrastructure on population health. It builds on 4 main services:

A Health Information portal: The foundation and main service of PHIRI is the COVID-19 FAIR data catalogue on population health and health care data.It facilitates access to and use of European data for research on the health of populations and on health care systems. The rollout and content development is carried out in WP4 Health Information portal for COVID-19 with the support of all the other WPs. The ICT support is provided in the WP2 Communication and portal development (WP2). WP7 Building a federated research infrastructure develops the tools to allow real time federated access. Additionally, rapid response to research questions and exchange of (best) practices are facilitated through the portal by WP8 Rapid Exchange Forum.
Investing in innovation in health information development for population health research: PHIRI supports health researchers to use Pan-European data in a federated way developed by WP7 Building a federated research infrastructure for a rapid policy response, to link different data sources and to make their research FAIR and ELSI compliant (WP 2, 4, 6, 7). Additionally, WP5 Research methodologies to assess the impact of COVID-19, more in depth on a specific topic WP6 Research use cases measuring the impact of COVID-19 on population health and WP9 Foresight: Modelling and Scenarios look at methodologies used in EU countries to monitor the wider impacts of COVID-19. These will then feed into the Health Information portal (WP4).
Providing capacity building to promote interoperability and tackle health information inequalities: PHIRI provides support for management of population health and healthcare COVID-19 data starting from the phase of designing data collections to analysis, reporting and preservation. Training of the health research community involves both the data producers and data users and strengthens skills to address the COVID-19 crises from a research perspective. Capacity building is a transversal activity throughout the proposal (WP 3.3, 4.4, 5.3, 7.3, 8.5, 9.2).
Assisting the health research community in developing methods for knowledge translation research: PHIRI supports researchers in methodologies (WP5, 6) to provide relevant and evidence based data ready for use in decision-making processes by citizens, clinicians, public health practitioners, policy makers. This is the return of investment to society improving the health of the European citizens and increasing the efficiency of our health care systems. Knowledge translation is supported through WP3 Outreach, engagement and sustainability and WP9 Foresight: Modelling and Scenarios. Additionally, key policy questions are addressed in WP8.

WP 1: Coordination and Management





























Objectives
The aim of this work package is to efficiently manage the project and to systematically monitor its activities in order to support the construction of the Population Health Information Research Infrastructure (PHIRI). This includes the day-to-day follow-up of the scientific, administrative and financial aspects of the project. WP1 will ensure that the contractual obligations are fulfilled and the expected results are delivered as planned.
More specifically, the objectives of WP1are:

To provide operational, administrative and financial management of the project
To support consortium networking among (research) institutions, research networks and international organisations
To coordinate internal communication among the different WPs and externalcommunication and collaboration between the consortium members, the different entities of the management structure and the European Commission (EC) scientific and administrative units
To facilitate and ensure convergence between WPs in the set up and roll out of PHIRIs activities
To coordinate and streamline surveys and or mapping exercises between WPs
To coordinate the quality of results and deliverables including the adherence to the work plan, the project aim and contractual obligations and the management and supervision of the internal review processes


Task 1.1 Operational and Administrative Management
This task ensures the successful implementation and the smooth running of the project. Regular Steering Committees (SCs) are organised with the Work Package (WP) leaders and co-leaders (every 6 months, seven in total). Additionally, General Assemblies (GAs) will be organised with all Consortium Partners and other relevant actors in the health information field. This includes one kick-off GA and a final GA, four in total. In the SCs and GAs, coherence and interlinkage between the WPs and Consortium Partners is fostered and potential issues discussed. The coordination ensures that the work assigned to the different WP teams is progressing according to schedule and within the allocated budget. Finally, the WP is responsible for the submission of the formal deliverables and the reporting and communication with relevant bodies such as the EC.

WP4 presentation - PHIRI roadshow 20220408







Objectives
The aim of this work package is to build theon health and health care data for COVID-19 to support structured information exchange between Europeancountries. The portal offers a FAIR catalogue with overviews of COVID-19 population health data sources, studies and capacity building exercises in the framework of PHIRI and beyond. The important tool to provide the necessary information is the network of National Nodes (NN), based on the Joint Action InfAct framework.


The objectives of this WP are:

To create a FAIR catalogue,
To promote and coordinate the sustainable network of NN,
To prepare an overview of population health studies and capacity building activities in European countries, and
To prepare guidelines and recommendations for legal and ethical issues.




Please have a look at our Documentation and user guide for the Health Information Portal. Metadata description. (1.0), (2022) on Zenodo.
Have a look to the Sustainability roadmap for the European Health Information Portal (2023)  on Zenodo.



Task 4.1: FAIR Catalogue 
Building on the work of InfAct and in close interaction with other important partners such as the ECDC and JRC a FAIR metadata catalogue is being created to describe COVID-19 population health data sources in Europeancountries and at international level. In a first step, metatemplates were created organising and describing national data sources available in countries and Europe. In a second step, through a web search, national COVID-19 data portals weresearched to pre-fill the metadata templates and in preparation for the country visits organised in Task 3.1. Currently, through theNN and country visits, Europeancountries are supported to complete the FAIR metadata catalogue and provide inputs on optimisation of the .

Task 4.2: National node Coordination and Promotion 
The Joint Action InfAct has prepared a framework to overcome a lack of coordination, communication and cooperation between stakeholders within Europe by encouraging them to establish NNs. A National Node brings together relevant national stakeholders in an organised way. Researchers from various institutes and research groups constitutecan thenshare expertise and updated knowledge on health information with each other. PHIRI continues this work in implementation ofNN framework by encouraging their set-up and further promotion.

Learn more about National Nodes.





Task 4.3: COVID-19 Population Health Studies 
This task is preparinga catalogue of scientific population health studies on the impact of COVID-19 in Europe; clinical trials are not included. A catalogue containing metadata information such as type of study, geographical coverage-national or subnational, data sources, target population indicators, etc. will be shortly provided on the .
Information available on COVID-19 Population Health Studies will be updated stimulating the Institutes to keep the information up to date and motivating researchers to fill in the catalogue (stressing the opportunity of sharing, comparing, setting up studies already implemented in other countries). For the sustainability of the catalogue, validation of reported information on identified studies will be regularly performed and checked with researchers stimulating updating of reported information and improving of planned studies.

Task 4.4: COVID-19 Training Material and Courses 
This task is developing an overview of existing training materials and courses on COVID-19 population health related issues. The cataloguewill cover both European and non-European materials and address different languages.

WP 6: Research Use Cases Measuring the Impact of COVID-19 on Population Health























Video file






Name
WP6-7 presentation - PHIRI roadshow 20220408






Objectives
The aim of this WP is to conduct research through use cases of immediate relevance for public health policies and management of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to facilitate further research by making scalable, reproducible methods available within PHIRI.
Specific objectives of this work package are to research:

direct and indirect determinants of COVID-19 infection and outcomes in vulnerable population groups with reference to inequalities,
COVID-19 related delayed care in breast cancer patients,
the impact of COVID-19 on perinatal health and perinatal health inequalities,
COVID-19 related changes in population mental health and
pilot activities carried out as Research Infrastructure through research use cases by pooling data across European countries, and feeding outputs in the federated research infrastructure.


Use Case A -Vulnerable populations, inequalities and risk factors with direct or indirect impact on COVID-19 outcomes 
Wide variations in COVID-19 infection and outcomes exist across Europe and within countries. This workpackage aims to clarify the relationship between a wide variety of risk factors as exposures and outcomes (infection, hospitalisation, death) and explore how this varies between settings and over time. Research will be carry out todemonstrate how the distribution of infection, outcomes and risk factors using individual level health record, administrative and research data can be combined with ecological/group level contextual data across European populations to produce actionable policy insights.



Use Case B -Delayed care in cancer patients 
Healthcare systems all across Europe have had to reorganize services and reallocate resources to provide attention to COVID-19 patients. Because of the rampant increase of cases that required intensive attention orthe inherent risk of COVID-19 nosocomial infection, all countries have been forced to cancel or postpone non-urgent care (e.g., elective surgery). This use case seeks to elicit:

Whether there has been an increase in time to treatment in women diagnosed with breast cancer in the month previous to the lockdown measures, as compared with women diagnosed with breast cancer before that period and
Whether this delay is a consequence of the intensity of the lockdown measures.





Use Case C -Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and newborn health 
Pregnant women and newborns are vulnerable during infectious disease pandemics because of specificities in their immune systems, maternal-fetal transmission, non-deferrable healthcare needs and risks of adverse perinatal outcomes due to stress and social deprivation. This use case:

Investigates the pandemics direct (infection by SARS-CoV-2) and indirect effects (related to health service accessibility and confinement) on perinatal health using routine population birth data,
Assesses whether effects differ by socioeconomic context,
Uses results to assess how policies in participating countries may have impacted health effects and social inequalities and
Improves preparedness for future epidemics by creating a template for utilization of routine population birth data and identifying needed improvements to current systems.





Use Case D -COVID-19 related changes in population mental health
Individuals with mental health risk factors or mental disease are most commonly affected by COVID-19 confinement measures and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This case study measures changes in population mental health associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.



Use case supporting activities for implementation in the PHIRI infrastructure
The aim of this final task is to support the specific activities regarding the use cases to ensure the effective linkage across WPs related to PHIRI infrastructure and it is divided into three activities:

Formalization of each use case data model and transport to the Common Data Model (CDM) for PHIRI
FAIRification of use case results: coordination of the design of metadata models of use case results required for its publication in the FAIR data portal.
Scalability, sustainability and rapid cycle analysis requirements.

WP 7: Building a Federated Research Infrastructure for a Rapid Policy Response























Video file






Name
WP6-7 presentation - PHIRI roadshow 20220408






Objectives
As an overarching goal, WP7 aims to create and validate a federated research infrastructure that overcomes data reuse & data sharing hindrances for rapid policy relevant research response to the evolving pandemic. This WP will develop on five main objectives:

Showing the potential of the infrastructure for a rapid cycle analysis using a demonstration pilot case.
Developing an advanced version of the federated research infrastructure, including: a) the development of a common data model for a COVID-19 rapid response; b) the design and deployment of the required data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) processes; and, c) the implementation of the distributed analytical solutions.
Testing the solutions implemented in 7.2 for a final implementation of the federated research infrastructure.
Developingupgrading options from the lessons learntin other EU research infrastructures.
Building an IT working group, for capacity building on how to get the federated infrastructure implemented and for the actual development of the federated infrastructure.

This work package will provide the technological substrate to support the development of a federated research infrastructure that overcomes these hindrances whilst producing research outputs for a rapid policy response. As a result, the PHIRI infrastructure delivered will play a key role in the future European Health Data Space as well as in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

Task 7.1. Development of an overarching demonstration pilot
Task 7.1 will demonstrate the capacities of the federated research infrastructure for the production of accurate and timely research outputs for a rapid policy response on COVID-19. The task entails the identification of the relevant data sources, the development of the data model and the analytical pipeline, and the FAIR reporting of the rapid cycle outputs. This taskwill generate solutions for the rapid cycle analysis and reporting of testing policies and assessment of the impact of control measures in the evolution of infections and hospitalizations. In addition, the analytical pipeline will be adapted so as to be able to reuse those COVID-19 data collections collected by ECDC for surveillance purposes. Alongside these efforts, PHIRI will explore with ECDC if collection of epidemiological data from MS can be reinforced and improved using the capacities of the relevant national public health bodies participating in the PHIRI consortium.




Task 7.2 Development of the federated infrastructure solutions 
This task represents the actual development of the federated research infrastructure solutions, driven by the WP6 use cases. First, the CDM design will explore the use of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM, a widely adopted CDM for observational health data analytics. Secondly, the analytical pipelines that support the use-cases will compute the local solutions for the research question on each data hub, moving these final aggregated results to the coordination hub, who will merge them for further comparative analysis between partners. Lastly, all the software developed will be open sourced and included in the WP4 PHIRI Portal.





Task 7.3 Capacity building and Developers working group 
This task will focus on the capacity building within the participant hubs personnel in two complementary ways:

Supporting the specific IT implementation activities.
Coordinating thedifferent ITactivities and the linkage of WP6 development activities through the settingup of a Developers working group consisting ofa community of data hubs IT experts in charge of the FRI implementation.


Task 7.4 Validation of the federated infrastructure solutions 
T7.3 will focus on validating the software solutions developed in T7.2, for the Common Data Model, the ETL processes and analytical pipelines, including the implementation of patches to solve the detected issues detected.

Task 7.5 Upgrading options for PHIRI research infrastructure 
This task will evaluate advanced distributed analysis techniques to upgrade options for PHIRI research infrastructure. At the same time, this task will assess the eventual need for future increasing computational and storage capacity; thus, the need of linkage with high performance computing centres or, public or private clouds. Finally, this task will get insight from WP9 on effective modelling with a view to upgrade the PHIRI infrastructure according to policy requirements.

WP 8: Rapid Exchange Forum























Video file






Name
WP8 presentation - PHIRI roadshow 20220408



Objectives
WP 8 aims to establish a sustainable infrastructure to support rapid exchange between actors from competent authorities, their advisors, researchers and stakeholders in the joint efforts to handle the COVID-19 pandemic. The emphasis is to collect and disseminate existing information and generate new (evidence-based) information as needed. The WP represents a central contact point for thepartners and it provides evidence-based policy support with the specific objectives:

To provide rapid response to research and policy questions that are raised in countries.
To promptly disseminate internationally agreed guidelines, standards, reports and initiatives.
To exchange (best) practices among countries regarding COVID-19.
To provide a link with policy: the shifting landscape of evidence for policy.


Task 8.1: Needs Assessment of COVID-19 topics to be covered in first instance
This task - includesa needs assessment for evidence-based policy support among health policy makers to identify the gaps between research and policy. The needs assessment is conducted via a survey that will be repeated on an irregular basis. Questions and responses will be continuously evaluated and potentially adapted. The aim of this task is to identify COVID-19 current and future priority topics, best practices and lessons learned from evidence-based policy support during the COVID-19 pandemicto help researchers to better respond to health policy makers needs in future pandemics.

(D8.1)


Task 8.2: Build up a one-stop shop for and between countries seeking for urgent answers
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, health policy decision makers, their advisors and researchers are in urgent need to obtain evidence-based information on a variety of topics that serve as a basis for health policy decision making. This task organizes virtual, bi-weekly meetingsin which the participants discuss specific pre-selected topics and ad-hoc questions as well as they share information from the experiences in their own countries.





Task 8.3: Establish a reliable network of experts and expertise for short-term inquiries involving existing and planned Networks
The specific objective of Task 8.3 is to establish a network of experts and expertise that can easily be approached for the purpose of information exchange and review of evidence-based policy support information, e.g. in an open forum. Further, the expert network complements existing expertise of project partners.





Task 8.4: COVID-19 related international guidelines, initiatives, projects and information sources
Task 8.4 started with a mapping exercise of sources of population health information on COVID-19 to provide relevant population health guidelines, standards, and reports with the aid of web scraping. Building on the mapping, this task will create a catalogue of existing international initiatives and projects on COVID-19 related diagnosis, treatments, interventions and measures (except policy measures) conducted in EU/EEA Countries.




Task 8.5 Monitor COVID-19 Policy and Impact Measures
The basis for this task is a mapping exercise of policy and impact measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic in EU Member States by web search and interviews. The results will feed into a catalogue on the Health Information Portal (HIP) that will be regularly maintained throughout the project duration.

WP 9: Foresight: Modelling and Scenarios























Video file






Name
WP9 presentation - PHIRI roadshow 20220408






Objectives
A better understanding of possible future developments is essential for policy makers to anticipate and possibly influence future trends. The current crisis makes it clear that Public Health Foresight Studies (PHFS) can help to get a better understanding of possible (health) impacts of the current COVID-19 outbreak, e.g., changes in regular health care services delivery, in lifestyle, and in socio-economic developments. The overall aim of Work Package 9 (WP9) is to gain insights into possible future health impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, by developing scenarios. A scenario is not a prediction, rather a consistent, plausible, and coherent description of the future that reflects on perspectives on past, present, and future developments, which can serve as a basis for action.
More specifically, the objectives of WP9 are:

To get an overview of how European countries have been using foresight and related methodologies (e.g. modeling, forecasting, etc.) regarding COVID-19.
To develop and provide foresight capacity (leveling the knowledge needed for performing foresight, reducing information inequalities, strengthening European data uniformity).
To support evidence-based policy decisions, by exploring direct and indirect effects of the current pandemic on population health using foresight.

To address these objectives, WP9 applies a multi-step approach as presented in the following 4 tasks:

Task 9.1: Overview of current foresight activities in Europe and beyond
The objective of this task is to make an inventory that provides an overview of current foresight activities and initiatives in Europe and beyond. A literature review was conducted. Additionally, European countries were asked (through a foresight-activities questionnaire) to list current activities on foresight (and related methodologies), the current capacity and potential demands for applying foresight methodology. At the same time, health foresight experts and academics were identified.





Task 9.2: Building capacity in foresight
In this task, a Foresight Capacity Building training course was organized covering different aspects of planning and conducting public health foresight studies. Interested professionals from European countries participated to learn and developing foresight skills. The aim of the course was to provide European countries with tools and opportunities for discussion by leveling all (interested) European countries to a similar degree of knowledge.

Task 9.3: Collectively identifying key uncertainties and (national and pan-European) challenges using scenario analysis and advanced modelling
In this task, scenarios (in the context of a foresight study) for possible future pathways of direct and indirect health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be developed. The scenario development will follow a systematic process. Based on the capacity built in task 9.2, participants will receive support to plan and develop their own foresight study. During this exercise, trends and possible short and long term direct and indirect health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be explored and the most important societal challenges arising from these trends (as well as a set of indicators) will be identified. When possible, the analyses will be supported by integrated, advanced model-based simulations.


Do you need some support to develop your own PHF study? 




Task 9.4: Developing guidance in identifying promising policy strategies (translating the information into knowledge)
The scenarios developed during Task 9.3 can provide possible images of the future and the associated societal challenges. To target these challenges, task 9.4 will identify promising policy strategies. Sequentially, the identified policy strategies will be discussed and further operationalized through policy dialogues (as a continuation of the scenario exercise).
Attention will be paid to the main issues that should be addressed within the countries strategic planning. A workshop meeting with national counterparts will be organized to identify gaps and needs regarding the preparedness of countries in facing future population challenges. The workshop will be used as a platform to discuss gaps and proposals from WP9 outcomes.
This task has also led to the creation of four foresight-informed policy briefs:

Glossary





















This glossary was created by the consortium partners of the European project with the aim of establishing agreed definitions of commonly used terms to harmonise the work of the project. The aim is that the glossary can also be used by other projects working in similar areas. The glossary was created through a series of glossary working group calls, during which each definition was discussed and agreed upon. This is a living document that will be updated regularly with the addition of new terms and modifications, if needed, of the terms and definitions currently there.
For the source of the specific definitions, please check the original HealthyCloud listed below.
Few termsare specific to the PHIRI's activities and are not part of the HealthyCloud glossary.

GLOSSARY
Aggregated data: Aggregated data is pooled data. Statistical data about several individuals that have been combined to show general trends or values within the data.Aggregated data are not necessarily anonymised data.
Anonymisation: The processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject. Removing personally identifiable information, so as to definitively not allow the identification of the data subjects.The methods used to anonymise the data are context dependent.
Cloud: Network of computing facilities providing remote data storage and processing services through the internet.
Cloud computing: Paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with administration on-demand.
Comparative population health research: Comparisons of health status, determinants and service use across countries, and/or over time.
Consent: An individuals agreement e.g. to participate in research, undergo a healthcare procedure, to personal data processing. Within the context of personal data, the GDPR defines consent as: Any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.
Data:Discrete observations of attributes or events that carry little meaning when considered alone

Data can be defined as the recorded factual material that is commonly accepted in the scientific community as information that is required to support research findings.
Refers to any digital representation of acts, facts or information and any compilation of such acts, facts or information, including in the form of sound, visual or audiovisual recording.
There are four major categorical types of data for where the data comes from: observational; experimental; simulated and derived.
Data is information available for processing.


Data access: The processing of data by a data user, which was provided by a data holder, in accordance with specific technical, legal, or organisational requirements, without necessarily implying the transmission or downloading of such data.
Data access right: the ability, right or permission to act on data in a defined location.
Data altruism: Consent by data subjects to process personal data pertaining to them, or permissions of other data holders to allow the use of their non-personal data without seeking a reward, for purposes of general interest, such as scientific research purposes or improving public services.
Data centric health research computational infrastructure: This infrastructure provides data as a service. This infrastructure includes services, such as data visualisation, hosting and processing of data. In particular, it canprocess health-related sensitive data. Technological infrastructures for data analysis, exploitation and/or processing.
Data controller: Under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as well as under the GDPR, the data controller is the party that, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. The actual processing may be delegated to another party, called the data processor. The controller is responsible for the lawfulness of the processing, for the protection of the data, and respecting the rights of the data subject. The controller is also the entity that receives requests from data subjects to exercise their rights.
Data curator:A person who is responsible for the quality and FAIRness of the health-related data, and to make sure the value of the data is discovered and accessible. This role also considers the possibility of enriching data when increasing its quality. Importantly, data curators might play a role regarding being processors, e.g. responsible for the data at hand.
Data discoverability: The ability or a mechanism to browse and locate available data relevant to a specific users purpose (e.g., research project) in a non-targeted search. Data is more discoverable if the data collection has metadata and the metadata is publicly accessible. Discoverability is related to findability from the FAIR principles.
Data model: In a distributed research infrastructure, data models are a formal description of data sources (entities, their attributes and their relationships) and metadata specific to a scientific study, that are the basis for semantic interoperability, thus allowing reliable comparative research.
Data governance: Assembly of policies and processes, coordination aspects, data usage and accessibility principles and data management procedures for a certain health data infrastructure to ensure legal compliance, consistency and good data quality throughout the different stages of the data life cycle.
Data processor: According to Article 3 (12) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, a processor shall mean "a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller." The essential element is therefore that the processor only acts "on behalf of the controller" and thus only subject to his instructions.In some cases, the processor may choose not to process the data himself, but may have recourse to a subcontractor who processes the data on his behalf. In practice, this will depend upon the processor agreement entered into with the controller.
Data provider/holder: Any natural or legal person, which is an entity or a body in the health or care sector, or performing research in relation to these sectors, as well as European Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies who has the right or obligation, or theability to make available, including to register, provide, restrict access or exchange certain data.
Data quality: The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of data fulfills requirements.Notes: The requirements are defined by the purpose of the processing and hence data quality can be viewed in other words also as a fitness for purpose. The purpose can be any use of the data, including primary use or secondary use. For the purpose of data protection, data quality refers to a set of principles laid down in Article 5 of the GDPR and Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, namely:

Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
Purpose limitation
Data minimisation
Accuracy
Storage limitation
Integrity and confidentiality


Data reuse: The most simple form of data reuse is using the same data in the same way more than once (i.e. starting with an original dataset, and drawing different research inferences). The data can also be repurposed and used for another intent (i.e. using data from health insurance registries for health monitoring, or for research).
Data sharing: Provision of data by a data controller to a data user for the purpose of joint or individual use of the shared data, based on conditions of use, directly or through an intermediary.
Data subject: As defined in the GDPR, a data subject is a person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
Data user:A natural or legal person/organisation who has lawful access to certain personal or non-personal data and is authorised to use that data for commercial or noncommercial purposes.
Dataset: Collection of data that is represented in a particular form. Datasets will vary depending upon the type of intended use, and how the collecting organization has decided to organize their data upon collection. Dataset is essentially a heterogeneous term that could be made up of any type of collection for any type of data.
Data curator: A person who is responsible for the quality and FAIRness of the health-related data, and to make sure the value of the data is discovered and accessible. This role also considers the possibility of enriching data when increasing its quality. Importantly, data curators might play a role regarding being processors, e.g. responsible for the data at hand.
Dataset catalogue: A collection of datasets descriptions, which is arranged in a systematic manner and consists of a user-oriented public part, where information concerning individual dataset parameters is accessible by electronic means through an online portal.
Data steward: A person who has an administrative role; they do not really use the data. They create guidelines to make data FAIR and advice on how to do it. Stewards might have direct responsibility on the data at hand (processors) or not.
Distributed research infrastructure: A decentralized and organised network of resources.
FAIR Data principles: Principles to define the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of resources for humans and computers at the source. For example, the principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data.

Findable: Data and supplementary materials have sufficiently rich metadata and a unique and persistent identifier.
Accessible: Metadata and data are understandable to humans and machines. Data is deposited in a trusted repository
Interoperable: Metadata use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
Re-usable: Data and collections have a clear usage licenses and provide accurate information on provenance.


Federated data analysis: Federated data analysis describes an analysis that is performed on multiple (often geographically) separated datasets. During this analysis, the data is not exchanged and can stay, for example, behind a given institutions firewall. Only the interim results of a local analysis are exchanged between the data-hosting sites). The aggregated non-identifiable results from each local analysis are pooled and returned to the data user.
Federated database: Afederated database systemis a type of(DBMS), which transparently maps multiple autonomousinto a singlefederated database. The constituentare interconnected via aand may be geographically decentralized.
Federated learning: This is a specific case of federated data analysis, for machine learning purposes. It is a learning technique that allows users to collectively reap the benefits of shared models trained from rich data collections. The learning task is conducted across multiple separate sites coordinated centrally. Each site has a local training dataset which is never shared . Instead, each site computes an update to the current global model maintained centrally, and only this updated model is communicated
Health data: Personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status.Health data collection: A technical infrastructure that holds datasets, makes datasets available for use, and organises data in a logical manner. The datasets may come from different sources, hospitals and/or research institutes from the same country (national data repositories) or different countries (international data repositories). Data collections may also cover appropriate, subject-specific locations where researchers can submit their data. Data collections may have specific requirements concerning subject or research domain; data reuse and access; file format and data structure; and the types of metadata that can be used.
Minimal inclusion criteria:

A digital platform that receives and stores data
It receives data from a single source and/or multiple sources
Allows discovery of the stored health data
It must have control over the data stored


Other possible characteristics of a data collection:

It could have a specific thematic, data type that it collects (e.g. a particular disease, a particular data type: genomic data, clinical data, EHRs)
It could be part of one or more overarching data hubs
It could generate data


Health data hub:
Minimal inclusion criteria:

A digital technical infrastructure with the core mission of enabling health data sharing
It provides health data from different sources
It allows discovery of health datasets
It has a metadata discovery service
It has a data accessibility mechanism in accordance with existing regulation
It has an authorization functionality, provided by the same Data Hub or by an external institution.


Health information: All organised and contextualised data on population health and health service activities and performance, individual or aggregated, that improves health promotion, prevention, care and policy-making.
Health information systems: A health information system is the total of resources, stakeholders, activities and outputs enabling evidence-informed health policy-making. The health information system manages all types of health data, from EHRs to imaging data and population health data. HIS activities include: data collection, interpretation (analysis and synthesis), health reporting, and knowledge translation, i.e. stimulating and enhancing the uptake of health information into policy and practice. Health information system governance relates to the mechanisms and processes to coordinate and steer all elements of a health information system.
: An infodemic is an overabundance of information  some accurate and some not  that occurs during an epidemic. It spreads between humans in a similar manner to an epidemic, via digital and physical information systems. It makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.
Information: Data which is contextualised, i.e. reduced, summarized and adjusted for variations such as the age and sex of population so that comparison over time and place are possible.
Infrastructure provider: The responsible organisation to support the physical management of health-related data following existing regulations. Parent definition for data hub, data collection and secure processing environment.
Input Data: Data provided to or directly acquired by an AI system on the basis of which the system produces an output.
Intelligence: the product of information being transformed through integration and processing with experience and perceptions based on social and political values.
Interoperability: Following the European Interoperability Framework, interoperability refers to a) a full compliance with the legal and ethical provisions in each constituent node; b) an organisation that supports knowledge exchange and software transference across nodes; c) a compatible technological environment that supports the communication between nodes and allows the deployment of the computational tasks; and d) the existence of common data models that enables semantic standardisation across data sources. In a distributed research infrastructure, interoperability is a key feature for its governance and achievements.
Knowledge translation: The appropriate exchange, synthesis and ethically sound application of knowledge to interventions that strengthen the healthcare system and improve health.
Machine learning: A subset of AI techniques based on the use of statistical and mathematical modelling techniques to define and analyse data. Such learned patterns are then applied to perform or guide certain tasks and make predictions.
Metadata: A set of data that defines and describes a resource (e.g., data, dataset, sample...) so that it can be understood, discovered and reused. There are different levels of metadata. Since metadata can be used to describe different aspects of data, we can group metadata properties in terms of quality, availability, provenance, processing, among others. Then there are metadata catalogues that can be developed to describe the available data collections in a repository or hub. Metadata is important to make data understandable, and can contribute to increase the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of the data. Metadata can be collected or compiled in repositories to improve the FAIRness level of the data collections.
National Node: ANational Node (NN) is an organisational entity, often linked to a national institution or governmental unit that functions as a national liaison and brings together relevant national stakeholders in the country in a systematic way. The relevant stakeholders may include, for example, the national statistical office, the national public health institutes, representatives from ministries of health, research and/or science, and others. In addition, the NN may function as a discussion and advisory forum in matters of health data and information both for national or international matters. Examples include aspects of the governance of data, indicators and health reporting at the international level and health information stakeholders at national level.
Non-personal data: All data other than personal data.
Open data: Data that is freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. Open license is a license agreement which contains provisions that allow other individuals to reuse another creator's work, giving them four major freedoms. Without a special license, these uses are normally prohibited by copyright law or commercial license. Most free licenses are worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, and perpetual (see copyright durations). Free licenses are often the basis of crowdsourcing and crowdfunding projects.
Open science: The movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional. Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks. It encompasses practices such as publishing open research, campaigning for open access, encouraging scientists to practice open-notebook science, and generally making it easier to publish and communicate scientific knowledge.
Personal data:According to Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725: "personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person".Name and the social security number are two examples of personal data which relate directly to a person. However, the definition extends further and also encompasses for instance e-mail addresses and the office phone number of an employee. Other examples of personal data can be found in information on physical disabilities, in medical records and in an employee's evaluation. Personal data which is processed in relation to the work of the data subject remain personal/individual in the sense that they continue to be protected by the relevant data protection legislation, which strives to protect the privacy and integrity of natural persons. As a consequence, data protection legislation does not address the situation of legal persons (apart from the exceptional cases where information on a legal person also relates to a physical person).
Personal data breach: A breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
Population Health Data/Health information: All organised and contextualised data on health and health service activities and performance, at individual or population level, that is fit-for-use and contributes to health promotion, prevention, care and policy-making.
Primary use of data: The use of any data for the purpose for which it was originally collected.
Processing (personal and non-personal): Any operation or set of operations which is performed on data or on datasets, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosureby transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
Profiling: Any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
Pseudonymisation: The processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
Public health monitoring and reporting: The activities necessary to obtain health data and information and bring this information into health policy and practice. 
Research Network: A Research Network (RN) is an active networkof national and/or regional experts from several countries that perform comparative research in a specific health area (information domain).
Restriction of processing (personal and non-personal data): As defined by the GDPR, methods by which to restrict the processing of data could include, inter alia, temporarily moving the selected data to another processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable to users, or temporarily removing published data from a website. In automated filing systems, the restriction of processing should in principle be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further processing operations and cannot be changed. The fact that the processing of data is restricted should be clearly indicated in the system.
Secondary use of data/data re-use:Secondary use refers to using data for a different purpose than the one it was originally collected for (i.e. than the primary use). According to the European Data Governance Act 2020 re-use means the use by natural or legal persons of data held by public sector bodies, for commercial or noncommercial purposes other than the initial purpose within the public task for which the data were produced, except for the exchange of data between public sector bodies purely in pursuit of their public tasks. Clinical definition: Secondary use of health data applies personal health information (PHI) for uses outside of direct health care delivery.
Secure processing environment: The physical or virtual environment and organisational means to provide the opportunity to re-use data in a manner that allows for the operator of the secure processing environment to determine and supervise all data processing actions, including to display, storage, download, export of the data and calculation of derivative data through computational algorithms.
Sensitive data: Information that is regulated by law due to possible risk for plants, animals, individuals and/or communities and for public and private organisations. Sensitive personal data include information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership and data concerning the health or sex life of an individual. These data that could be identifiable and potentially cause harm through their disclosure.
Synthetic data:The concept of synthetic data generation is to take an original data source (dataset) and create new, artificial data, with similar statistical properties from it. Keeping the statistical properties means that anyone analysing the synthetic data, a data analyst for example, should be able to draw the same statistical conclusions from the analysis of a given dataset of synthetic data as he/she would if given the real (original) data. The use of synthetic data is growing in many fields: from training of artificial intelligence models within the health sector to computer vision, image recognition and robotics fields. Synthetic data should not be confused with "mockup data", which, although close, is not synonymous. Mockup data is primarily used for initial testing purposes, e.g. in design phases to prototype applications. It doesn't necessarily maintain the statistical properties of real data. Learn more about the difference between synthethic vs mockup data .
Testing Data: Data used for providing an independent evaluation of the trained and validated AI system in order to confirm the expected performance of that system before its placing on the market or putting into service.
Training Data: Data used for training machine learning algorithms (e.g., an artificial intelligence (AI) system) through fitting its learnable parameters.
Validation Data: Data used for providing an evaluation of the trained AI system and for tuning its non-learnable parameters and its learning process.
Use case: A software and system engineering term that describes how a userinteracts within a system to accomplish a particular goal. Ause caseacts as a software modeling technique that defines the features to be implemented and the resolution of any errors that may be encountered.

BeYond-COVID (BY-COVID) aims to provide comprehensive open data on SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases across scientific, medical, public health and policy domains. It will strongly emphasise mobilising raw viral sequences, helping to identify and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The project will further accelerate access to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and linking patient and research data.
To ensure interoperability of national and global efforts, BY-COVID will enable federated data analysis compliant with data protection regulations, harmonise and manage metadata and sample identifiers, and facilitate long-term cataloguing.



 (Unravelling Data for Rapid Evidence-Based Response to COVID-19) is a functional network of 29 partners capable of harvesting real-world data derived from the response and provision of care to COVID-19 patients by health systems across Europe and internationally.
These real world data comprise mostly information from electronic medical records from front line hospitals, as well as national surveillance data, registries, and integrate information from over 300,000 COVID-19 patients initially, and anticipated to increase as databases are being updated on a continuous basis. Studies into patients characteristics, determinants of diseases prognosis, and safety and effectiveness of treatments and potential strategies against COVID-19 in real world settings, are envisioned to complement findings from efficacy/safety clinical trials where vulnerable populations, those most at risk of severe COVID-19, are often excluded.
unCoVers ultimate goal is to bring together European and international expertise to monitor, identify, and facilitate the access and utilization of this type of data, identifying knowledge gaps, and underrepresented populations, and proactively seek synergies with complementary existing and planned clinical databases.

PREPARE Cluster



























 



PREparedness and resPonse for emergency situAtions in euRopE

In recent years, there have been increasing instances of cross-border crises, including climate change, terrorism, international trade disputes and global health threats, like the COVID-19 pandemic. These emergency situations require large-scale planning for preparedness and response in order for countries to be able to cope with unforeseen challenges. The European Commission has recently funded many projects to work on different aspects of crisis management, many with a focus on managing pandemics. While each project has distinct aims and challenges, they all work towards a common goal.
It is for this reason that thirteen EU-funded H2020 projects, with a combined funding of 79million, have united to form the PREparedness and resPonse for emergency situAtions in euRopE (PREPARE) cluster. Each of the thirteenprojects is tackling challenges specifically looking at the preparedness and response phases of crisis management and working together we aim to achieve stronger results and greater impact for our cause. Together , , , , , , ,,, , ,  and  will explore synergies, research opportunities and deliver joint activities to maximise impact. Through mutual support, the cluster will strengthen our response to the ongoing crisis and our aim to be better prepared for future health crises.

European Burden of Disease Network


























Aims and objectives
What are the most relevant diseases in a country? Which risk factors are the strongest contributors to disease and death? How is the impact of different diseases evolving over time, and how does it compare between countries and within subnational units? As the need for prioritising the use of available resources constantly increases, a timely, sound and comprehensive answer to these fundamental questions is more than ever needed to inform public health decision making. Driven by the impact of the Global Burden of Disease study, several researchers and national and international health institutes have adopted the burden of disease approach to address these questions.
The complexity of the burden of disease approach however, resulted in major disparities in research capacity across Europe. Furthermore, the current burden of disease landscape remains scattered, and researchers struggle to translate their findings to decision makers. The  will address these challenges by acting as atechnical platform for integrating and strengthening capacity in burden of disease assessment across Europe and beyond. To achieve this mission, the Action is cooperating with theof the WHO Regional Office for Europe.

COVID-19 Burden of Disease Training School - in collaboration with PHIRI
The COVID-19 Burden of Disease Training School provides an introduction to burden of disease assessment, using COVID-19 as a case study. It provides public health professionals, and researchers from related fields, with practical knowledge about summary measures of population health, the historical background of the Global Burden of Disease study and its outputs. Furthermore, the Training Schoolintroduces the concept and rationale of the main metrics (YLLs, YLDs and DALYs), and underlines their application and importance or priority setting in public health policy and decision-making processes.
The Training School will be organized jointly by theand the.

Structure
The Training School will be organized as three modules taking place from 30 March to 1 April 2022 in Ljubljana, if the COVID-19 measures will allow it . Each module will include theoretical and practical sessions, exercises and follow-up discussions. Each module is planned to take place from 9h30 to 15h00 CET, including a lunch break.

Module 1 (Introduction to DALYs and YLLs)introduces summary measures of public health and the basic concept of burden of disease, DALYs and YLLs
Module 2 (Introduction to YLDs)focuses on disability weights and the other main YLD inputs: input data, severity distributions, and comorbidity adjustment
Module 3 (DALYs: theory to practice)addresses practical issues related to data, assumptions, and uncertainties, and puts a focus on knowledge translation


Registrations
Registrations closed on the 31st of January 2022 at midnight.

Eligibility and prerequisites
The Training School is open to all burden-eu members and partners institutions of the PHIRI project. The number of participants will be limited to a maximum of 30. If the number of applications would exceed the maximum number of available seats, candidates will be selected a) to prioritise motivated students and early career investigators, b) to ensure gender and geographical balance (and favouring representatives from Inclusiveness Target Countries), and c) to prioritise highly motivated candidates.
Teaching will be in English. Exercises will require a basic proficiency in MS Excel.

BeYond-COVID (BY-COVID) aims to provide comprehensive open data on SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases across scientific, medical, public health and policy domains. It will strongly emphasise mobilising raw viral sequences, helping to identify and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The project will further accelerate access to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and linking patient and research data.
To ensure interoperability of national and global efforts, BY-COVID will enable federated data analysis compliant with data protection regulations, harmonise and manage metadata and sample identifiers, and facilitate long-term cataloguing.



 (Unravelling Data for Rapid Evidence-Based Response to COVID-19) is a functional network of 29 partners capable of harvesting real-world data derived from the response and provision of care to COVID-19 patients by health systems across Europe and internationally.
These real world data comprise mostly information from electronic medical records from front line hospitals, as well as national surveillance data, registries, and integrate information from over 300,000 COVID-19 patients initially, and anticipated to increase as databases are being updated on a continuous basis. Studies into patients characteristics, determinants of diseases prognosis, and safety and effectiveness of treatments and potential strategies against COVID-19 in real world settings, are envisioned to complement findings from efficacy/safety clinical trials where vulnerable populations, those most at risk of severe COVID-19, are often excluded.
unCoVers ultimate goal is to bring together European and international expertise to monitor, identify, and facilitate the access and utilization of this type of data, identifying knowledge gaps, and underrepresented populations, and proactively seek synergies with complementary existing and planned clinical databases.

For intelligence gathering and threat assessment,  needs support from the Member States and associated countries, and a comprehensive state-of-the-art IT system generating actionable insights for decision-making is crucial.
The upcoming HERA IT platform for intelligence gathering will only be operational if Member States have strong national IT systems that are interoperable with HERAs IT system and other relevant systems. EU-HIP () supports participating countries to enhance and improve national IT systems in an efficient and coordinated manner, with the objective to obtain the needed interoperability with HERAs IT platform.
This will entail developing new IT systems and strengthening as well as aligning existing IT systems for the assessment of health threats and for intelligence gathering in the area of medical countermeasures at national level. Moreover, there is focus on promoting data comparability, and streamlining reporting to different systems. EU-HIP will facilitate integration of national IT systems with the HERA IT platform currently under development, and complement existing systems for early warning and response, epidemic intelligence, public health surveillance and medical countermeasures.
