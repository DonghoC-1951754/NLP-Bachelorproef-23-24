IMI 2 project
Big Data for Better Outcomes is a comprehensive European research programme aiming to develop key enablers to support health care system transformation through the use of big data. The initiative will develop platforms for integrating and analysing diverse data sets, focusing on outcomes that matter to patients and generating meaningful insights that will help improve health care.
BD4BO four disease-specific projects so far: ROADMAP (Alzheimers Disease), HARMONY (Hematologic Malignancies), BigData@Heart and PIONEER (Prostate Cancer)

These disease-specific projects are supported by the Coordination and Support Action (DO->IT) as an overarching coordination structure (completed in 2019), and the European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN) project which will be a federated network of relevant data sources.
