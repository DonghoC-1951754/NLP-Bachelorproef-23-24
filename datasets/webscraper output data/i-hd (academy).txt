QUALITY OF
                                HEALTH DATA






























Health data is often not fit for crucial reuse purposes such as clinical research, decision making, value-based health care. We therefore catalyse stakeholders to scale up their data quality, by coaching, educating and equipping
                                them with instruments, organising assessments, providing insights and strategies to benchmark and enhance their health data quality, and providing expert support in all phases of the research lifecycle.




























































INFORMATION
                                GOVERNANCE






























All organisations, and the public, need to trust the ways in which health data is used, and by whom. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has heightened our awareness of this. We have translated our expertise in data protection for reuse purposes into codes of practices, educational and certification programmes, which we provide to organisations and European projects.

























































TRUSTWORTHY
                                HEALTH ICT SYSTEMS






























With more and more health ICT systems collecting and exchanging health data, we see a growing demand to demonstrate the trustworthiness of those systems. Using 1700 criteria and a standardised conformity assessment framework, we assess and certify the quality and governance of health ICT platforms.




























































DATA
                                INTEROPERABILITY
                                STANDARDS






























Interoperability standards are vital to scaling up health data use, even more so given the rise of patient and citizen generated data. i~HD staff and experts have a long history of developing international health data interoperability standards, and their adoption into products and health ecosystems, connecting clinical information between silos to enable safer and more effective patient care, and big data research.

























































QUALITY LABELS:
                                CERTIFICATES & SEALS






























Organisations handling health data want to provide assurance they do so in trustworthy ways. i~HD programmes offer audits for data, ICT systems, information governance and skills. As an independent institute, i~HD is best positioned to award quality labels to stakeholders that showcase their engagement, quality and accountability. 




























































SCALING UP

We know that everybody needs to do more, and invest more, in health data through improved models of healthcare delivery, patient empowerment, and the development of innovative diagnostics and treatments. We help to stimulate this multi-stakeholder momentum to
                                collect, curate, share and analyse data across care and research, for the benefit of all.

QUALITY OF
                                HEALTH DATA






























Health data is often not fit for crucial reuse purposes such as clinical research, decision making, value-based health care. We therefore catalyse stakeholders to scale up their data quality, by coaching, educating and equipping
                                them with instruments, organising assessments, providing insights and strategies to benchmark and enhance their health data quality, and providing expert support in all phases of the research lifecycle.




























































INFORMATION

All organisations, and the public, need to trust the ways in which health data is used, and by whom. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has heightened our awareness of this. We have translated our expertise in data protection for reuse purposes into codes of practices, educational and certification programmes, which we provide to organisations and European projects.

























































TRUSTWORTHY
                                HEALTH ICT SYSTEMS






























With more and more health ICT systems collecting and exchanging health data, we see a growing demand to demonstrate the trustworthiness of those systems. Using 1700 criteria and a standardised conformity assessment framework, we assess and certify the quality and governance of health ICT platforms.




























































DATA
                                INTEROPERABILITY
                                STANDARDS






























Interoperability standards are vital to scaling up health data use, even more so given the rise of patient and citizen generated data. i~HD staff and experts have a long history of developing international health data interoperability standards, and their adoption into products and health ecosystems, connecting clinical information between silos to enable safer and more effective patient care, and big data research.

























































QUALITY LABELS:
                                CERTIFICATES & SEALS






























Organisations handling health data want to provide assurance they do so in trustworthy ways. i~HD programmes offer audits for data, ICT systems, information governance and skills. As an independent institute, i~HD is best positioned to award quality labels to stakeholders that showcase their engagement, quality and accountability.

The European Institute for Innovation through Health Data (i~HD) is a European, not-for-profit organisation facilitating the optimal uses of health data through a series of complementary activities.






































OUR VISION






We strive for a world in which multiple stakeholders collaborate in the trustworthy use of high-quality health data to continuously improve care and accelerate research.




























We are working to realise this ambitious challenge through leveraging multi-stakeholder co-operation. That is why we have taken the form of a neutral membership-based organisation that strives to unite all health data stakeholders
                      to share challenges, solutions and to learn from each other.
Our stakeholders include:


















































































































































































OUR misSION






We promote, develop and share good practices, tools and quality assessments to maximise community value from health data for innovations in health, care and research. 




























In order to catalyse change and innovation within the health ecosystem: 







we work across these stakeholders through education and events to promote collaboration
we play a strong role in national and international R&D projects and European-wide collaborative initiatives
we develop practical methods and solutions
we develop international quality certificates, seals and labels.

i~HD was created in 2016 as the sustainable result of the IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiatives) sponsored project Electronic Health Records for Clinical Research (EHR4CR) and a number of other European R&D projects supported by
                      the European Commission, at a time when the use of digital health data in e-health solutions was on a steep rise. This digital revolution emphasised the need to tackle the growing challenges related to the quality and interoperability
                      of health data on a sustainable basis. Moreover, obstacles to using health data were not being addressed by other initiatives so this was another gap to fill.
We consulted widely with other existing European institutes, and with many stakeholder groups who endorsed our creation, helped us to formulate our mission, objectives and our starting priorities to help accelerate the benefit from
                      making better use of health data, for all.
In this way, via our founding members (EuroRec, RAMIT, empirica and TMF), i~HD brings together over 30 years of coordinating experience and participation in more than 100 European projects, as well as of services in the field of quality
                      of data and EHRs.

The General Assembly is the primary decision-making body of our European Institute. As the governance of i~HD is ultimately executed through its member organisations, expert representatives of each of the nine stakeholder groups represent
                      their sector in the General Assembly.





























Executive Board





















The Executive Board is the body that sets out the strategic policy of the organisation. Each of the stakeholder groups is represented in the Executive Board by one member.





























Board of Directors





















The Board of Directors ensures that the strategic policy set out by the General Assembly and the Executive Board is translated in operational decision-making processes. It also guarantees the continuity of i~HDs daily management.

      | A well-managed hospital data management plan is critical for the secondary use of health data, as it ensures the security and privacy of the data, as well as its accuracy and integrity. A high quality data management plan should include key factors that ensure the effective and secure use of healthcare data.
      
      | As the regulatory landscape around the governance of artificial intelligence, health data reuse and innovation continues to evolve, our research and innovation community find themselves navigating a transition from one set of known governance expectations to additional challenges.
      
      | MedTech companies can offer benefits to multiple stakeholders within the healthcare ecosystem. Especially when it comes to the use and reuse of health data. But to unlock all this potential, we need to ensure that the data is of high quality.
      
      | Today is a day that i~HD reflects on solemnly and with hope because Data Protection and Privacy are core to our founding principles and our work. We lead on several EU projects for data protection and ethics, we have developed codes of practice for the safe and effective use of data, we have co-run roundtables exploring the impact of novel innovation approaches including Artificial Intelligence, and we have developed educational, outreach and quality assessments for Information Governance, ethics and their role in data driven innovation.
      
      | In any healthcare organization it is critical that the importance of data quality be properly explained. From management perspective to the healthcare providers, a sensible and understandable rationale must be given in order to obtain active participation in the data quality effort.
      
      | By Nathan Lea, i~HD DPO & Information Governance Lead For over three years handling of EU Citizens personal data has been governed by the General Data Protection Regulation but myinvolvement with anticipating its impacts predated this. There were points in 2017 where I sensed something special was []
      
      | The European Commission has, since the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), made efforts towards the implementation of policies and regulations which are fit for the digital age while also ensuring trustworthy and safe use and reuse of data.
      
      | By Dipak Kalra, Presidenti~HD There is a growing momentum right across Europe to scale up our learning from routinely collected health data (real-world data  RWD). The need for us to learn more from data is widely recognised by all stakeholders. We need to track health outcomes []

Getting the most out of our health data









 

























i~HDs holistic approach to health data






It is great to use health data, it would be greater to use great health data. i~HDs holistic view (*) for endeavoring to get the most out of health data is to focus on:







Data Quality
Information Governance
Health ICT Systems







After wide consultation and engagement of many stakeholders to fill a recognised gap, i~HD has initiated six areas of work, as presented below.
Within these areas European and multidisciplinary experts contribute, in line with the vision and mission of i~HD, throughout a diversity of initiatives to get the most out of health data in Europe and beyond.
















































Our core work streams




















































QUALITY OF
                                HEALTH DATA






























Health data is often not fit for crucial reuse purposes such as clinical research, decision making, value-based health care. We therefore catalyse stakeholders to scale up their data quality, by coaching, educating and equipping them with instruments, organising assessments, providing insights and strategies to benchmark and enhance their health data quality, and providing expert support in all phases of the research lifecycle.




























































INFORMATION
                                GOVERNANCE






























All organisations, and the public, need to trust the ways in which health data is used, and by whom. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has heightened our awareness of this. We have translated our expertise in data protection for reuse purposes into codes of practices, educational and certification programmes, which we provide to organisations and European projects.

























































TRUSTWORTHY
                                HEALTH ICT SYSTEMS






























With more and more health ICT systems collecting and exchanging health data, we see a growing demand to demonstrate the trustworthiness of those systems. Using 1700 criteria and a standardised conformity assessment framework, we assess and certify the quality and governance of health ICT platforms.




























































DATA
                                INTEROPERABILITY
                                STANDARDS





















Interoperability standards are vital to scaling up health data use, even more so given the rise of patient and citizen generated data. i~HD staff and experts have a long history of developing international health data interoperability standards, and their adoption into products and health ecosystems, connecting clinical information between silos to enable safer and more effective patient care, and big data research.

























































QUALITY LABELS:
                                CERTIFICATES & SEALS






























Organisations handling health data want to provide assurance they do so in trustworthy ways. i~HD programmes offer audits for data, ICT systems, information governance and skills. As a neutral institute, i~HD is best positioned to award quality labels to stakeholders that showcase their engagement, quality and accountability.

We know that everybody needs to do more, and invest more, in health data through improved models of healthcare delivery, patient empowerment, and the development of innovative diagnostics and treatments. We help to stimulate this multi-stakeholder momentum through conferences, workshops, think tanks, education and policy influence.

Why use and re-use health data?




























Health data has proved to be a crucial enabler in the development of innovative health, care and research solutions.
This process was facilitated by new digital ways for collecting, storing, exchanging and analysing health data, meaning it can be re-used a second time, and more, not only by the person who collected the information but also by other
                      clinicians, researchers and health authorities.

Sources of health data






When hearing about health data, most people think of the medical information that is introduced in their health records during visits to their GP or hospital. But there is more. Health data registration is all around and rapidly growing:







through remote monitoring devices prescribed by health professionals
over personal tracking devices such as fitness apps or dietary monitoring
to major national health databases.

















 





				Population registries/ clinical trials databases
				




				Mobile health tracker
				




				Care pathway / decision support

				




				Environmental data
				




				Clinical application
				




				Bio sensor

Trustworthy use and re-use of high-quality health data





















The exponential growth of health data will allow for life-saving breakthroughs
if we manage to make good (re-)use of good data.

Reliable re-use of data






Real-world health data is usually captured and structured for its primary objective of providing safe and personalised care to each individual patient.
It needs to be fit for the intended re-use purposes!
Some critical requirements for optimal re-use involve the quality, the interoperability and the trustworthy handling of health data.


























Quality of health data







Is the health data that is being analysed accurate?
Is it representative of the population under scrutiny?
Has it been introduced in a consistent and correct way?























INFORMATION GOVERNANCE







How can organisations assure that they protect peoples privacy when handling personal health data?
How can organisations successfully integrate GDPR regulations into daily routines?
How can health data be safely handled through trustworthy health ICT systems?























TRUSTWORTHINESS OF HEALTH ICT SYSTEMS







How can healthICT systems that handle data be conceived and used in ways that meet the highest data privacy requirements?
Does the system function as it was meant to function?

                                  data does so in trustworthy ways ?

data interoperability standards







Is there a clear definition of how data should be mapped and transferred from one health ICT systems to another?























INTERACTION BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS







How can stakeholders share challenges and solutions to scale up the uses of health data?

Patients, caregivers, patient representatives, citizens and population health / prevention organisations







When all your health professionals have access to your up-to-date health data, they are able to provide more efficient, higher quality, safer and more personalised care and care coordination.
When you have access to your health data, you can better manage your own health.
Health data provided to scientific research will speed up the development of new medical products and treatments for individuals who need them.





























Judicious use of health data will boost health care providers ability to become learning health systems and facilitate:







the delivery of safer evidence-based care and improve health outcomes
a more efficient use of health care resources
participation in more clinical research and allow for more inhouse research
























By analysing great numbers of health data, health policy makers and funders can:







give recognition to high-quality and value-based care
better guide ongoing healthcare and prevention programmes
improve public health strategy and plan for the future



















Pharmaceutical and life science organisations are bringing health care research and innovation to a higher level through the analysis of high-quality real-world data and research data. They therefore:







need to raise awareness of the importance of re-using health data
demonstrate the trustworthiness and privacy-compliance of their own data handling and systems
collaborate with data providers whose data and systems have been validated as well




















The implementation of interoperabilitystandards has become vital to facilitate the transfer of health
                              data between health ICT systems and the sharing of health data for secondary use.
Certification organisations perform audits so as to provide an objective evaluation of the trustworthiness or quality of health data or health ICT systems used by research platforms, health apps, governments, care professionals
                              etc.



















With a growing interest in sharing and re-using health data and the rise of new digital health technologies, the health ICT industry is challenged by an increased demand for value-added interoperable solutions for the trustworthy
                            capture, management, exchange and analysis of high quality data.


















Whether the aim is to participate in clinical research, to build and share knowledge, to respond to local and nation-wide health challenges or to prevent sickness and disease, high-quality and trustworthy health data catalyses
                            the opportunities for academics and research centers to stay on top of their game.


















Health & data strategy organisations provide both operational and strategic advice, business intelligence,
                            data warehouse services etc. The quality of these services is directly linked to the presence and the trustworthiness of health data.


















The growing importance of health data has led to new opportunities for the data-driven industry: wearables, AI, brokerage services  In order to gain wide-spread credibility and trust, this sector needs to meet strict requirements
                            and produce evidence related to their trustworthiness and the quality of the data they use.

Minor errors, major implications















Ensuring high-quality data seems evident and straightforward, but unfortunately this is not the case in practice. Several studies have demonstrated that routinely collected health data today is of variable quality, and is often not
                      fit for the intended purpose.





















































The annual financial impact of poor data quality on organisations is estimated to lie between $9.7 million and $3.1 trillion (Gartner & IBM).












Clinical decisions can be misguided when based on low quality health data. For example, a study found that 48% of patients required additional monitoring, examination or treatment after medication errors resulting from weight
                            errors (Selbst et al., 1999 , Pediatric Emergency Care). Further, cleaning data in preparation of conducting research is time-consuming.












Incomplete or incorrect personal health data can result in erroneous clinical decision support output. In addition, data quality issues in patient subpopulations can yield biased research findings.

Are you doing enough to protect health data?









































Re-using health data is crucial for advancing research and health care. But health data is highly personal and sensitive information, and its protection is strongly regulated.

Health data protection: privacy, security, ethics





















Health data use is tightly governed. However, the regulatory requirements need careful understanding and are subject to change.




























Information governance






Organisations around the world who provide services to EU citizens have to comply with theGeneral Data Protection Regulation(GDPR).
GDPR has to work alongside with other aspects of information governance such as ethics, security and contractual obligations.


































































































Reliance on health ICT systems






Organisations need to provide assurance of the processes, tools and practices that are in force when using the health ICT system. Privacy, ethical, security and data protection compliance is essential.

































Reliance on educated staff






Having robust policies, codes and practices is important, and ensuring all your staff understand appropriate data protection is equally important.

Scaling up the quality of your health ICT system to get the most out of health data




























Health ICT systems and the data they handle have more and more come to the forefront as critical business functions for any health care organisation.
The requirements of state-of-the-art software are multiplying and becoming more complex due to:







the boost of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
the increasing need for connecting ICT systems 
GDPR compliance
escalating demands by customers and regulators
etc.










It is a huge challenge for ICT developers to stay on top of these fast-changing requirements and to implement them accordingly.



























ICT companies need solutions to keep the trust of their stakeholders.





























Assessing health ICT systems will improve their effectiveness, reliability and meaningful use





























i~HD expertise in health ICT system assessment related to health data






i~HD has developed expertise and programmes to cover functional testing of ICT systems with the focus on data handling and data flows.





























Benefits of an independent assessment






i~HD guarantees independent assessments performed by international peer auditors. The outcome of the assessment is always a report, which can be accompanied by an i~HD quality label
















Obtaining an i~HD quality label means that your organisation can








 


 demonstrate the conformity of its products, services, organisational processes and practices with specified requirements outlined in standardised schemes based on validated criteria











 enhance its reputation with users, regulators, industry and all other interested stakeholders and boost your customer satisfaction











 facilitate trade, market access, fair competition and consumer acceptance at a national and international level and in an expanding health systems landscape











 improve the quality of the internal processes




































Good software, great data





























Fundamentals of ani~HD systems quality assessment






An independent i~HD systems quality assessment always includes the following fundamentals:






















Scoping & objectives















Depending on the complexity of the ICT system and the objectives of the assessment, scoping is absolutely necessary. Scoping can be done from a technical, geographical, or medical perspective.






















Criteria















Criteria are the foundations of a high-quality assessment. They have to be fine-grained, unambiguous, auditable and preferably defined In consensus by all parties involved.






















Documentation & auditor SOPs















In addition to the unambiguous character of the criteria, the criteria need to be documented for the software developers. Auditor SOPs (standard operating procedures) are always developed as an obligatory requirement to a successful
                    assessment.






















Scenarios & test data















During the assessment, the auditors use validated scenarios which have been customised to each assessment project. Test data is required to properly execute the test cases and to verify the expected output in the software application
                    under assessment.






















Audit















The Audit will be performed by a team of independent multidisciplinary peer auditors.






















Report















The auditors provide i~HD, the auditing body, with a draft report identifying the conformities and the non-conformities. i~HD will hand over the final report to the software vendor/sponsor/client.






















Quality label















An assessment may result in an i~HD quality label.





























i~HD as your partner for criteria selection and validation






















Over 1700 fine-grained validated criteria






i~HD has access to a repository of over 1700 indexed fine-grained validated criteria, including 60 validated criteria relating to clinical data platforms.
The design, the development and the validation of the criteria sets is executed in close collaboration with RAMIT and EuroRec. Both organisations have a long history as scheme owners.
















Validation of new criteria sets






As new criteria sets are being developed by stakeholders in the health ICT ecosystem, such as regulatory bodies (governments), industry or the software vendor itself, we step in to help define the criteria and to go through the validation

Why we promote the development and use of interoperability standards 





















As people get health care in more than one facility, their clinical information is stored in different electronic health systems.
Re-using health data for better individual and collective health care provision implies the transfer of health data from one ICT health system to another similar system.
Unfortunately, health ICT systems use different standards, or no standards at all, which means that not all data can be easily linked and connected.
Hence there is a need for interoperability standards, which define how clinical information should be transferred.






































































Standards facilitate seamless sharing of information between health information systems





























Interoperability standards: a long history






















Still a challenge






There is a long history of developing international standards to enable mappings between health ICT system.i~HD experts bring 30 years of history in interoperability research and standards making.
Bodies such as CEN, ISO, HL7, IHE, WHO, LOINC, SNOMED, CDISC and OMOP are examples of organisations that have defined relevant parts of the standards landscape for the kinds of data transfer they specialise in.
However, despite this rich array of available standards, the experience of most health care professionals and patients is a lack of connectivity. People undertaking large-scale research struggle to bring together the data they need,
                      on enough patients, and their data harmonisation costs are a substantial part of the total cost of undertaking research.
















Towards a connected and collaborative health environment






This landscape is changing, thankfully.Health care funders (health ministries, health insurance) increasingly want care to be connected. They are starting to demand better clinical outcomes and to financially incentivise those
                      outcomes. This stimulates, for the first time, a business case for hospitals to be more interoperable.
Secondly, countries are now making substantial investments in research infrastructures that aggregate the data at large population levels. These investments are gradually also trickling down to health care organisations as incentives
                      to have better connected and better quality data.





























Improved interoperability is a critical success factor for making better use of data





























i~HD is active in promoting the development and use of interoperability standards







Some examples

































We have developed an education syllabus for teaching the public and health professionals about the International Patient Summary.

















We have contributed to an interoperability guide for health decision makers, that will be promoted through the eHealth Network to Member State health ministries.

















Through our participation in the project
                            , we are involved in bridging clinical research and healthcare standards.













































We have been involved in projects that promote the adoption of interoperability standards, and help to guide health care organisations, health professionals, patients and the public and
                              industry about the value of interoperability standards and why they should adopt them.
For example, i~HD was a partner in the
                               project which has helped to promote co-operation between countries internationally to develop a standard for exchanging patient health summaries, and demonstrated its value in emergency disaster recovery situations.




















Through our sister institute EuroRec we are involved in a DigitalHealthEurope project
, co-ordinated by i~HD member empirica, which is promoting the importance of interoperability across all stakeholders. 

DigitalHealthEurope has also developed a portal to explain interoperability standards to the public. This website went live early 2021.

Health data is more and more collected and stored electronically, often through a variety of digital technologies, devices and apps.



The diversity of health information technologies means that data is often collected in separate, unconnected silos.



We need to connect health data sources, for many reasons.

About us















Digital Health Standards is a joint communication effort between the DigitalHealthEurope project, empirica and The European Institute for Innovation through Health Data to grow awareness about the importance of health ICT standards.
























Our goal is to provide educational information about health data standards to







enable decision makers, SMEs and the public to better understand the health ICT standards landscape,
promote the value of interoperability standards,
show when and where standards adoption can lead to valuable and needed interoperability,
champion the adoption of standards, potentially as a positive disruptive influence in our ecosystem.

IDHIS  Information Governance Certification Programme









 

























IDHIS
Information Governance & Data Privacy for Health ICT Systems







For data facilitators, there is a new certification scheme to ensure trust in your organisation and to 
boost your business

















































Huge challenges in the re-use of health data are building and retaining trust and demonstrating GDPR compliance, amongst data providers, data facilitators and data users.
This lack of trust may slow down your business, namely as a data facilitator connecting health data sources, bridging from data providers to data users. With so many data breach scandals, cybersecurity risks and high penalties in the
                      public eye, assurance of compliance has never been more vital for all stakeholders.
Without (accredited) certification, the market for these ICT platforms (data facilitators) will grow slowly and opportunities to conduct real-world data research, to respond to the needs within clinical research and health care, will be lost.





























Prove the integrity of your health ICT system, gain trust, increase efficiency and boost your business





























Need for an Independent Information Governance Assessment






















Are these your organisations concerns?








 


 Is your handling of health data secure, transparent and reliable?











 Do you have up-to-date and state-of-the-art knowledge on privacy, ethics and security?











 How will you ensure trust and boost your business?











 Are you compliant with national and international legislation?











 How do you balance the tension between being GDPR-compliant and the value proposition of re-using health data?






















In order to give confidence to all interested parties that a product, process or service is compliant to specified requirements such as GDPR, certification is essential.
The value of certification is the degree of confidence and trust that is established by an impartial and competent demonstration of fulfilment of specified
            requirements by a third party.
Secure, protected and ethical health data flows must be demonstrated in order to foster trust and generate value.
There is a growing demand to demonstrate that ICT systems comply with the highest information governance standards.





























IDHIS is the first information governance certification programme of its kind









































IDHIS audits the conformity of data flows throughout the health ICT systems against a unique set of international criteria relating to
                    privacy, ethics, security and data protection.
Independent auditors examine how the organisations govern their staff, processes, tools and procedures by assessing their information governance.
IDHIS certification programme awards those organisations that have an information governance-compliant health ICT system with a Certificate (IG1-2020).
The certificate owner shows to their customers that their data governance is trustworthy and conforms to the highest international standards.

Who may apply for IDHIS?






The IDHIS certification programme is a must-have for ICT companies that are facilitating (re)-use of health datavia their ICT platform.
These ICT platforms act as a bridge, retrieving data from data providers, generating added value to this data and make it available to data users, e.g. research, A.I. , Learning Health Systems.

IDHIS Criteria Sets

















Europes first Information Governance & Data privacy for Healthcare ICT Systems Certification scheme is based on a set of 142 criteria focusing on:




 



























Example of a criterion (accountability)






The organisation has an updated and version-managed policy for the agreements/contracts that organises and properly identifies them so that the policy comprehensively covers any data processing within the baseline agreements.

































Description of IDHIS Criteria Sets



































The first subset of criteria checks if the organisations health data flow and health data handling comply with the international and national GDPR regulations. Risk-based policies, procedures, codes of practice, data assets, data
                          processing tools, internal audits and corrective actions and consequent updating must be in place.

Are definitions clear in your contracts? How do you check the ethical concerns, the execution of the data privacy rules, informed consent procedures, data handling responsibilities, the applicability of the contract and the duration
                            of the contract?
Data handling is never without risks! How do you manage your companys risks on your databases, data formats, middleware, APIs?
















The transparency criteria shall ensure that the data subject is correctly informed and fully aware of the processing of any personal data. The data subjects must be aware of the processing of any personal data. The data subjects
                          must be aware of risks, rules, safeguards, and their rights in relation to the processing and how to exercise these rights. The organisations registries of clients and partners participating in the data processing have to be
                          updated and consultable.

As a data subject, do I have all relevant information and are all legal bases defined as legitimate interests? How is this checked within your company?
Are you sure that your clients register is up to date? What are the corrective measures if the register is not up-to-date?
















This section refers to their onboarding and offboarding of users procedures, including access management and their management of cyber security. This also includes the organisations ability to monitor and manage risk, their procedures
                          for review and improvement and penetration tests, as well as internal audits.

How do you check if the information security action plan is managed correctly?
Do you check if the employees responsibilities related to data handling are defined and executed in line with the ISMI?













This set of Audit Readiness criteria focuses on the management and availability of logs of the auditing files and whether the organisation is able to respond to external audits. This section also focuses on the protection of the
                          logs as well as their details.

Can your audit logs prove that the data have been retained, archived or destroyed according to the contract/agreements, ethics or scientific committee and/or statutory legal requirements?
Do your data assets registers contain audit logs and are checked for correct use?













This set of Data Processing criteria checks on determining minimum data requirements, upholding data inventory agreements, conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA), handling minimisation of data through anonymisation
                          and pseudonymisation and retaining data as per regulatory requirements are also within the focus of this set of criteria.

Does your organisation check if the data minimisation and retention conform as defined in the agreements? What if this is not the case?
How are you sure that your DPIAs cover all GDPR and local supervisory authorities policies?













This set checks the ability to enforce its own compliance and contractual obligations on its staff and partners. It also checks the enforcement of data protection supervisory authorities. They also assess the performance of the
                          Data Protection Officer and the proof of internal staff training regarding correct and adequate data handling matters.

If supervisory authorities start an investigation on a GDPR issue, are you prepared to enforce the required information? Is this also defined in the agreement with your clients/stakeholders?
Does your DPO reply to external queries within the required time limits?


























How can you ensure robust data protection whilst re-using health data?

Health data is centre stage in many of the call topics for research and development projects and initiatives sponsored by industry and national eHealth and research bodies.
                      
There is a burning need to collect, use and reuse health data for understanding disease trajectories, identifying trends, predicting evolutions, taking the right care planning decisions and accelerating research.
















The health data challenges






This growing reuse of health data goes hand in hand with the growing awareness of the importance of

We are currently in projects making trustworthy use of hospital electronic health record information to improve the efficiency and quality of clinical trials, projects that are scaling up the generation of real-world evidence
                              by networking multiple electronic health records and registries and other data sources.
We are involved in research projects focusing on specific patient populations, such as women in pregnancy, and patients with rare diseases.
We are working on societal challenges of improving healthcare, for example in patients with multiple long-term conditions, the collection and sharing of health outcomes data across Europe and the creation of a knowledge hub
                              on mobile health programmes.
We have two projects taking a deep dive into medicines information, one promoting the adoption of an international standard for the identification of medicinal products, and one enabling better medicines information to support
                              patient empowerment and decision making.

Due to population ageing and advances in medical science, people with chronic diseases  including advanced severe life-threatening chronic diseases  live longer. Challenges are how to sustain quality independent living for the patient;
                      support caregivers facing an increasing burden; create sustainable healthcare and social care systems with limited resources.




























ADLIFE aims to provide a solution for the integration of therapies and approaches targeting early detection and assessment of deterioration, advanced and well-coordinated care planning and integrated supportive care to enhance quality
                      of life, reduce suffering and accelerate recovery for these patients and their families. It will deploy developed and validated personalised digital solutions for integrated supportive care based on H2020 projects C3-Cloud and Power2DM,
                      previously tested in two health systems. The ADLIFE Toolbox solutions include: a Personalised Care Plan Management Platform, Clinical Decision Support Services; Interoperability Solutions and Patient Empowerment Platform with Just-In
                      Time Adaptive Intervention Delivery Engine.
i~HD is a partner and leads work on data management and GDPR compliance, the communication of the project results to patients, the public and to healthcare systems, and contributes to the business plans for sustainability.
The ADLIFE Project has received funding from the European Union under the Horizon 2020 Programme, and started on 1 January 2020.

Atrial Fibrillation Integrated Approach









































Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots in the heart. AF increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. The prevalence
                      of AF is growing amongst Europes elderly population, often facing multimorbidity. The management of AF therefore requires a holistic approach rather than a single-disease approach with fragmented care.




























AFFIRMO aims to move from fragmentation to an integrated care strategy designed to be patient-centred. AFFIRMOs care pathway will improve the clinical management of older AF patients, taking into account personal treatment preferences,
                      social context, polypharmacy etc. It will enable synergies and cooperation among the different health disciplines involved, and shared decision-making with the patient. AFFIRMOs care pathway will rely on a digital platform develop
                      to assist physicians in applying and tailoring a personalised care strategy.
i~HD is a consortium partner and handles all legal and ethical challenges. This involves leading work on information governance, GDPR compliance and data sharing.
AFFIRMO has received funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 899871. It started on 1 May 2021 and will end on 30 April 2026.

Many diseases are still diagnosed, monitored and studied in part on the basis of biological samples that have been mounted on a glass slide and studied under a microscope. Today, that analysis is still carried out by a human pathologist,
                      but what if the slides could be scanned and analysed using artificial intelligence (AI)?And what if they could be placed in a repository and made available to the scientific community? These are the questions the BIGPICTURE
                      project hopes to answer.




























To achieve its goal, the project will first create the infrastructure needed to store, share and process millions of (often heavy) image files. Secondly, they will address legal and ethical issues to ensure patient privacy and data
                      confidentiality issues are fully respected.

Real world evidence on safe, effective medicines use in pregnancy and lactation









































Conception is developing an ecosystem for generating and disseminating real world evidence on the use of medicines in pregnancy and during breastfeeding, the effectiveness and safety of these medicines.





















The evidence will be generated through a network of womens health databases held by consortium partners and third parties, and published for access by women, healthcare providers and other decision makers including medicines regulators.This
                      will be achieved by generating, cataloguing, linking, collecting and analysing data from pharmacovigilance, modelling, routine healthcare, pregnant women and their children through a large network. i~HD is a partner and leads a work
                      package on multi-stakeholder engagement and consensus building on the acceptance of real-world evidence, in particular interacting with medicines regulators such as EMA. It also leads a task on information governance and GDPR compliance.
                      The ConcePTION project has received funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking. This Joint Undertaking receives support from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and EFPIA.

Empowering and Equipping Europeans with health information for Active Personal Health Management and Adherence to Treatment









































Safe use of medication and adherence to treatment are significant public health challenges where understanding, access to accurate information, capabilities to comprehend, and trust play major roles. The worldwide research project
                      Gravitate-Health aims for improved access and understanding of health information, for safe use of medicines, risk minimization and improved quality of life. 





















To that effect, Gravitate-Health will develop and test an integrated, digital, user-centric health information solution seeking to demonstrate tangible improvements in availability and understanding of health information from a set
                      of trusted sources, starting with regulator-approved medicinal product information and the Electronic Health Record International Patient Summary (EHR-IPS).
The main outputs will be an open source digital platform and a white paper with recommendations on realistic strategies to strengthen access, understanding and future use of digital services like electronic product information (ePI)
                      as a tool for risk minimization.
i~HD leads a work package focused on the pilot studies and their evaluation, to derive the evidence on how delivering better quality medication and health information to patients through mobile technologies can impact on their understanding
                      of their medication, adherence to it and health outcomes. We are also contributing to the business modelling and long term sustainability strategy.
The project has received funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 945334. This joint undertaking receives support from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme
                      and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations [EFPIA]. It started on 1 November 2020 for a project duration of 60 months.

HIPPOCRATES is a research project which aims at promoting early identification and improving outcomes for patients with psoriatic arthritis.By looking into the disease mechanisms of psoriatic arthritis, the 26 European partners
                      collaborating in HIPPOCRATES aim at improving diagnostic and therapeutic options for patients living with this condition.




























Through gaining a better understanding of the complex interplay between clinical and environmental factors, genotype and molecular pathways, the team aims to enable earlier diagnosis and a more accurate prediction of disease progression.
                      This will revolutionise treatment and deliver profound patient benefits.The HIPPOCRATES partners contribute a diverse range of backgrounds including clinical, scientific, data analytics, ethics, patient participation as well as SME and pharmaceutical industry expertise.
Data management
In order to achieve its goals, the HIPPOCRATES project will set up a single integrated database combining the cohorts and datasets of the most important European PsA studies and establish a Europe-wide library of relevant clinical
                      biosamples. HIPPOCRATES will also establish a large, prospective, observational study of 25,000 patients with psoriasis who will be recruited and followed on-line for development of PsA.
i~HD has responsibility for ensuring robust data protection, data management and FAIR data sharing.
The project runs for a period of five years, starting in June 2021, with a total budget of EUR 21 million provided by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI 2), a Joint Undertaking of the European Union and the European Federation
                      of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).

H2O is a five-year project (Oct. 2020- Sept. 2026) which strives to empower patients with digital tools to monitor their outcomes in a standardized manner. Patients can share these data with their physicians and other healthcare providers
                      to facilitate communication in an evidence-based, structured manner. In this way, they will be better able to collaborate with their treating clinicians in making joint healthcare and treatment decisions to obtain the best possible
                      health outcomes.
Additionally, collecting patient-reported outcomes in a standardized way can, when the data are anonymized and aggregated, be used to help health systems learn how to provide the best, most efficient care possible to all patients.
                      Aggregated health outcomes data at a national or European level can be a valuable resource for public health and clinical research.




























In order to safeguard patients health data, the highest level of integrity and data security will be ensured, by only communicating aggregate data and not patient level data, while at the same time enabling greater transparency of
                      outcomes to allow better decision making for both individual patient treatments as well as health system design.
i~HD is a work package co-leader working with colleagues especially on the governance model and sustainability of the planned H2O outcomes observatories, on multistakeholder engagement and consensus building, and on information governance
                      including GDPR compliance.
H2O is funded through the Innovative Medicines Initiative.The consortium brings together patient groups and the
                      best of breed health outcomes generation ecosystem, as well as experts in data standards and quality, psychometric methods, federated networks, governance, business modelling and IMI experience.

Addressing Psychosocial and Lifestyle Risk Factors to Promote Primary Cancer Prevention: An Integrated Platform to Promote Behavioural Change









































Europes Beating Cancer Plan set has ambitious goals addressing key behavioral risk factors for cancer development, such as tobacco (target reduction of 30% by 2025), alcohol consumption (target reduction of 10% by 2025), unhealthy
                      diets and physical inactivity. As about 40% of cancer cases in the EU are preventable, health promotion and preventive measures for cancer can benefit from the implementation of behavioural change (BC) and emotional management
                      (EM) in the general population.




























However, previous research and practice have generally failed to achieve sustainable BC due to two factors:
1) not taking into account recent BC concepts showing the need of personalizing interventions and techniques;
2) not considering psychosocial features and emotions (e.g. anxiety and depression), which can interfere with effective BC and increase the risk of developing cancer. 
The main objective of this project is to design, develop, and test the iBeChange platform, a user-focused management system that empowers people to achieve healthy and sustainable behaviors and emotions. The iBeChange innovative system will be developed by experts from clinical and health psychology, oncology, epidemiology, ICT, data science, and the health policy. The iBeChange project will go beyond the state of the art of sustainable BC and EM by combining practice- and evidence-based knowledge coming from clinical psychology and BC theories with the potentialities of adaptive digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Thus, the iBeChange system will be able to dynamically observe, learn about user behaviours, and then deliver tailored and effective health interventions in a dynamic learning process. The final goal of the iBeChnage project is to contribute to the goals of Europes Beating Cancer Plan and European Code Against Cancer by improving long-term primary cancer prevention through informing, supporting, and empowering EU citizens. This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on Prevention & early detection (behavioural change).
The i~HD team, as a consortium partner, leads on the ethical, legal and regulatory compliance supporting iBeChange in its mission to promote healthier outcomes in the area of cancer care and prevention. i~HD is responsible for developing
                      the information governance frameworks, ensuring GDPR compliance, and data quality planning. i~HD is developing an approach to incorporate the assessment of AI components as part of the wider governance tapestry in line with the forthcoming
                      AI Act.

Label2Enable is one of the projects the European Commission has launched to contribute to an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive health industry. European leadership in digital technologies like health apps creates jobs
                      and economic growth, in particular with small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). European standards are to ensure patient safety, quality of healthcare, effectiveness, interoperability and productivity. Citizens, health care providers
                      and health systems benefit from a swift uptake of health apps that significantly improve health outcomes. Health app manufacturers benefit from more efficiency in co-creating health apps that satisfy the needs of patients, health
                      care providers and health authorities and regulators and accelerated time-to-market.




























The project consists of three pillars: Trust, Use and Adoption

                      and
                      cooperate in the pillar Trust. They will co-create and test the CEN-ISO/TS 82304-2 handbook for accredited health app assessment organizations, in ISO terminology an ISO/IEC 17065 certification scheme. They will ensure
                      that the handbook contains appropriate accepted assessment methodologies, aligns with EU legislation and values, produces the same consistent results regardless of the assessment organization involved, and works as well for app manufacturers.
                      They will secure maintenance of the handbook after the project and enable accreditation of assessment organizations. They will also investigate if legislation for the label is sensible and who is to pay for the assessment.
Use

                      and the
                      cooperate in the pillar Use. They will investigate who consumers trust most to give them recommendations on health apps and what will also help people with low health literacy to use the quality label.
                      They will find out what healthcare professionals need in the detailed health app quality report to be able to recommend health apps and how to display the label effectively in app stores, app libraries and trusted sources.
Adoption

                      cooperate in the pillar Adoption to promote CEN-ISO/TS 82304-2. They will involve stakeholders through various channels. With use stories of pilots with CEN-ISO/TS 82304-2 in Italy, Catalonia, and
                      the Netherlands and potentially more countries or regions, they will provide insights on how to implement the assessment framework effectively. Finally, they will explore with health insurers and health technology assessment bodies
                      how the ISO assessment framework can help in decision-making on reimbursement of health apps.

The Multiple Sclerosis Data Alliance (MSDA) is a global multi-stakeholder collaboration that was launched in 2019. It is working to accelerate research insights for innovative care and treatments for people with Multiple Sclerosis
                      (MS).
Scaling-up real-world MS data is necessary to transform the care of people with MS and MSDA envisions a patient-centric data ecosystem in which all stakeholders contribute and use big data to co-create the innovations needed to advance
                      timely treatment and care of people with MS.




























The MSDA Toolbox aims to reduce the time needed to find and assess data registries and cohorts, building a data source catalogue and tools that can help a potential research user to understand the kind of data that is inside any data
                      source before formalising a research data access request.
The MSDA Academy focuses on awareness raising, community building and education, providing education to the MS professional, research and patient communities on topics relating to good practices in the use and sharing of data.





























We help shape the MSDA Academy workshops and the information governance approach




























i~HD is a partner in this consortium, which is being funded mainly by pharma industry sponsorship. We lead a work package on MSDA Academy workshops, and lead work on information governance (including GDPR compliance, and data sharing
                      agreements).

 The millions of people affected by autoimmune conditions have a reduced quality of life. Focusing on ANCA vasculitis as an exemplar relapsing multi-system autoimmune disease, PARADISE will use patient level data to identify the characteristics,
                      or markers, most often linked to relapse events.

Synthetic generation of hematological data over federated computing frameworks
















































Under a global lens, the impact of hematological diseases is staggering
Unfortunately, as is common for rare diseases, both the scarcity and fragmentation of available data prevent researchers from reaching the critical mass required for pushing forward basic and clinical research, and heavily impacts
                      health authorities capabilities for effective health planning.
Moreover, their underrepresentation in coding systems highlights the complexity of tracing patient pathways within healthcare systems, thus limiting the long-term sustainability of existing and new patient registries established at national and European levels.





















SYNTHEMA aims to establish a cross-border health data hub for rare haematological diseases: a space to develop and validate innovative AI-based techniques for clinical data anonymisation and synthetic data generation (SDG). The ultimate
                      ambition is to address the issues around data scarcity and fragmentation to effectively widen the basis for meaningful, GDPR-compliant research in this disease space.
As a consortium partner,i~HD supports the ethical, legal and regulatory compliance challenges for the development of synthetic data generation using latest AI technology.

Up-scaling the global univocal identification of medicines









































This innovation action will give a powerful impulse to implementation of ISO IDMP (ID of Medicinal Products) standards in EU Member States drug databases, supporting safe cross-border ePrescription/ eDispensation and effective pharmacovigilance.





















Once EU-interoperable data on medicines taken by patients become available, further benefits will accrue through better health data for improved clinical decision support, patient empowerment, public health and clinical research. New opportunities will arise for pharma industry, software developers, SMEs providing smart apps and others, thereby fostering their innovation capacity and competitiveness.
The project ambition centres on conversion of key regulatory and clinical processes to use IDMP. These information value chains must be converted over their full length from data input to data repositories to data usage. The project
                      will mainly focus on the implementation of EU and national SPOR (substances, products, organisations, referentials) data bases, including establishing an EU Substance Reference System (EU-SRS). Such information is fundamental to
                      cross-border ePrescription where safe dispensation may require reliable identification of substances in available products. 19 countries are represented, including 26 national Drug and eHealth Agencies. Stakeholders are involved
                      through their associations. This project is funded through the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.
i~HD leads work packages on the delivery of enhanced medicines information to patients, pharmacists and clinicians, its use in pharmacovigilance and in personalised medicine, and the incorporation of IDMP medicines identification standards
                      into healthcare provider and pharmacy systems including decision support.

In order to explore to what extent current systems can deliver the data that would be needed for a more outcomes-based care model, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) has launched a project
                      together with i~HD to perform an assessment of how a selected sample of European hospitals collect data on Heart Failure outcomes.
Heart failure is a chronic condition with dramatic consequences for peoples quality of life that is estimated to affect more than 10 million people in the EU, also leading to around 2% of all health care expenditure. Collecting meaningful
                      data on the health status of heart failure patients is an important step to ensure better quality care, and as a result better quality of life, for these patients. The project will continue to run through 2020-21.





























How ready are European hospitals to evidence their outcomes?




























Our role is to reflect wide-ranging background expertise about many of the challenges that lie in scaling up value-based health care, but with a special emphasis on clinical engagement issues and on the availability of relevant health
                      data to provide evidence of clinical outcomes achieved by health care providers. i~HD will assess the readiness of 10 example hospital EHRs to measure health outcomes.
The benchmark for the exercise is ICHOMs standard set for Heart Failure, which represents a global standard for the data that ideally should be collected, including patient-reported outcomes. The objective is to explore how much of
                      the ICHOM standard set is routinely collected today in a sample of hospitals, and draw conclusions on what the gaps are and how they could be addressed.





























How to address the gaps to accelerate a transition towards an outcomes and value based focus




























A reference group with representatives of patients, clinical experts, hospital management and industry experts is providing advice to the project, including on the scope and deliverables, selection of hospitals and what data items
                      to focus on.

Sharing personal health data will result in better health care for individual patients and for society as a whole




























New diseases, ageing populations and the rising cost of health care provision are putting pressure on our health systems.
At the same time, we see promising evolutions such as cutting-edge health research, the development of revolutionary technologies and innovative techniques, new and more effective treatments and medication.
These health innovations are often data-driven.

Health care is becoming more and more complex and specialised. Besides our GP, we are likely to consult one or more hospital clinicians, home care or social care workers and other health professionals, either for personal health issues or for a close relative. Or we may need emergency care in another region of the country or abroad where swift access to our essential health information may be crucial to determine the outcome of the treatment we need.
When all of these health professionals have access to our up-to-date health data and are aware of the treatments we were prescribed by other members of the care team, they will be able to provide higher-quality and more personalised care. Better coordination will make care provision safer and more efficient as it will make it possible to reduce medical visits, avoid redundant exams and prevent duplicate or even conflicting treatments.




































With the rise of data-driven health tools such as wearable devices, remote monitoring, mobile health apps and shared electronic health records, people are more closely connected to tracking their own health.
Having access to our health data, provides the insights to better manage our health. This understanding will give us a stronger voice interacting with our care team to jointly make the best decisions and to define an
                                      appropriate care plan taking into account personal priorities.
Being an informed partner in our own care will also boost motivation to carefully follow up on medical instructions and adopt the necessary lifestyle changes.
Moreover, active patient engagement has proven to lead to better health outcomes and better care experiences.




































Researchers and clinicians need large quantities of health data to understand disease, its causes, its progression over time, the treatments that have been (un)successful.
The analysis of health data of millions of people helps them to forecast health trends, to speed up diagnosis, to discover new and more effective treatments, medicines and medical technologies, to personalise care,
                                      to roll out Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) applications.
The health data susceptible to boost health research has often been routinely collected in electronic health records kept by clinicians, but also in population registries, and more recently through mobile health trackers,
                                      bio sensors, etc.
Conversely, patients may be invited to participate in clinical trials for researchers to gather very targeted health data, opening opportunities for patients to get acces tothe newest medical advancements.




































Hospitals and other health care providers are facing the ever harder challenge of delivering high-quality but cost-effective services in an increasingly complex health care environment. 
Health authorities and funders are forced to ensure sustainable, future proof care strategies, carefully balancing budgets against increasing demands.
The analysis of great quantities of health data can help health care providers to improve quality and safety, efficiency and performance, planning and care pathway optimisation.
Public health decision makers can rely on big data analysis to produce evidence for policy and resource planning, for public health surveillance and strategy.














































How health privacy is protected





















People may worry about the privacy and security of their sensitive health information.

How can access to personal health data be limited to authorised persons?
What measures do health data users take to safeguard their ICT infrastructures against cyberattacks?
Will personal data not be used for other purposes?

There are legal, organisational and technical precautions to protect the identity of individuals when data is used, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ethical codes of conduct, rules for anonymizing data, access
                      controls, audit trails etc.
As it is our ambition to foster legitimate trust in data sharing, we have developed expertise to assist all stakeholders to comply with regulatory requirements and ethical standards.

The privacy-compliant use of high-quality and trustworthy health data and systems is crucial to embrace these opportunities




























Health care providers:
                      How solid is your health data approach?






Are you sure all measures are in place in order to 













































Be confident of the quality of your health data





















Get the right insights






Learning from the health data that is stored in your patients EHRs is the foundation for clinical, operational and strategic decision-making.
The quality of your decision-making is linked to the quality of your health data.However, the quality of this data is not always what you might expect.



























We provide you with instruments, insights and strategies to know and enhance your data quality

Gain the confidence of research companies






You want to scale up your opportunities to participate in clinical research so as to offer your patients access to innovative medical advances and to enable your clinicians to stay at the top of their game.
However, real-world health data is often not fit for purpose.
You will be more eligible to participate in clinical trials if pharmaceutical and other research companies are reassured that your patient population fits their needs.

Create clarity and alignment






Health data is the most personal and sensitive information. Its use is tightly governed.
GDPR compliance is a challenge that has to interplay with other aspects of information governance such as ethics, security and contractual obligations.
In addition, the assurance of the processes, tools and practices that are in force when using a health ICT system is essential.
And finally, you want to educate your staff to ensure they understand and adhere to your practices and policies.

Providing and promoting better health through judicious health data use




























Health systems across Europe are facing huge challenges and need to adapt rapidly in order to remain sustainable whilst improving quality,
                      by developing future proof care and research strategies, optimising the efficient use of resources.





































































The analysis of great quantities of health data can produce evidence for policy, strategy and resource planning.









































Data-driven insights are crucial to support the current and future health and research challenges and enhance public health.









































The returns of health care funding can be optimised through the scaled-up, judicious use of health data.









































Governing bodies should be able to rely on high-quality health data to drive more effective care provided by the health care providers under their supervision.

Health policy makers & funders:
                      How to put health data to good use?






To guarantee the best uses of health data, you need to be confident of 














































Encourage health care users to improve and demonstrate their data quality





















For better insights and decision making






Several studies have demonstrated that health data is not always of a good enough quality or fit for the intended re-use purposes.
Health data is traditionally captured by healthcare providers and provider organisations, but increasingly also by medical devices, sensors and health apps directly by patients.
Encouraging these organisations and suppliers to meet data quality assurance criteria will ensure you have reliable evidence to develop better and more efficient health care services and prevention programmes.



























We provide instruments, insights and strategies to know, enhance and benchmark data quality









































Create reassurance in the ways health data is used





















Promote GDPR understanding and adherence






Health data is the most personal and sensitive information. Yet, it is crucial to enhancing health care and boosting research. Health data use is therefore tightly governed. The privacy regulations need to be well understood
                                      and carefully applied.
One way to create assurance is to disseminate knowledge and promote adherence to the GDPR. 



























We organise health-data-focused GDPR tutorials













































Endorse privacy-compliant health ICT systems





















Promote safe digitisation of health care






Digital health systems now connect to an increasing number of other systems and platforms. Every data custodian needs to be confident about what they connect to and every patient needs to be able to trust their data
                                      is safe within those systems.
Having the privacy, ethics, security and data protection processes of health ICT systems assessed, will contribute to a trusted health data system.



























We assess the privacy, ethics, security and data protection processes of health ICT systems.













































Validate digital health systems that demonstrate their reliable functional operation





















Selection of criteria and assessment






The requirements of state-of-the-art health software are multiplying and becoming more and more complex.
Users (both organisations and citizens),commissioners and health authorities want guarantees that health software operates in accordance with the relevant functional criteria.
i~HD has access to a repository of over 1700 indexed fine-grained validated criteria. Furthermore, as new criteria sets are being developed by stakeholders in the health ICT ecosystem, we step in to help define the
                                      criteria and to go through the validation phase that is required before integration in a standardised scheme.




























Our programmes cover the functional testing of health software








































Have confidence in the validity of quality labels





















i~HD can help produce the necessary evidence by issuing different types of quality labels.
We bring over 30 years of learning and expertise in our quality labels. Our team of auditors have clinical, technical, academic and legal backgrounds and have
substantial expertise in developing quality seals,backed by a robust assessment methodology and criteria.

Health data is the most personal and sensitive information. Its use is tightly governed.
GDPR compliance is a challenge that has to interplay with other aspects of information governance such as ethics, security and contractual obligations.
In addition, the assurance of the processes, tools and practices that are in force when using a health ICT system is essential.
And finally, you want to educate your staff to ensure they understand and adhere to your practices and policies.

Demonstrate the trustworthiness of your digital health systems




























The soaring use of health data is reflected in the growing adoption of digital health systems and applications, from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) used by health care providers & organisations
                      to fitness and health apps readily accessible for all citizens.
The need to capture and manage health data in trustworthy ways has forced the health ict industry to meet complex and high requirements.





































































Health authorities rely on data-driven insights to design future proof health care strategies. In addition, they start endorsing mobile health apps, and even provide for reimbursement, for apps that meet the highest requirements.









































Health care providers rely on EHR data to deliver evidence-based care and optimise care coordination. EHR systems need to allow for proper analysis while safeguarding patient privacy.









































Researchers and clinicians want to conduct large-scale data analysis to speed up health innovations. Seamless exchanging or connecting and quality of data are crucial requirements. 









































Patients and citizens are more and more convinced of the added value of digital health, and willing to embrace this, provided data protection and smooth operation are ensured.

Stay on top of the fast-changing requirements






The requirements of state-of-the-art health software are multiplying and becoming more and more complex.
Users (both organisations and citizens),commissioners and health authorities want guarantees that your software operates in accordance with the relevant functional criteria.
i~HD has access to a repository of over 1700 indexed fine-grained validated criteria. Furthermore, as new criteria sets are being developed by stakeholders in the health ICT ecosystem, we step in to help define the
                                      criteria and to go through the validation phase that is required before integration in a standardised scheme.



























Our programmes cover the functional testing of health software








































Make sure the data in your system can be linked and connected





















Facilitate seamless sharing






Thetransfer of health data from one ICT health system to another similar system is necessary to allow for better individual care provision and for big data analysis.
i~HD is active in promoting the development and use of interoperability standards through EC Support Actions and innovation projects, awareness campaigns, guides and educational materials for professionals and decision makers.

Increase the efficiency of your development processes






Health data is the most personal and sensitive information. Its use is therefore tightly governed.
Your digital health systems has to be designed with data privacy and protection in mind.
We can help educate your developers and designers to understand and integrate the GDPR privacy regulations in your software packages. 



























We organise customised tutorials as well as open courses in the field of GDPR













































Safeguard privacy when sharing and exchanging health data





















Promote safe digitisation of health care






 Every user of your software needs to be able to trust their personal health data is safely protected. In addition, in a collaborative health ecosystem, every data custodian needs to be confident about the data they connect to.
IDHIS, i~HDs Information Governance Certification Programme, audits the conformity of data flows in health ICT systems against a unique set of international criteria relating to privacy, ethics, security and data protection.
Having your health ICT systems assessed, will contribute to a trusted health data system.

Create trustworthy health intelligence to lead the way




























Health care systems and organisations are constantly balancing exciting opportunities such as the introduction of new technologies and medicines, the development of A.I. algorithms and more personalised care against the threats of
                      soaring health care expenditure and calls for more accountability, to name just a few.
Health data is often at the heart of operational, strategic and clinical insights, business intelligence and data warehouse services that support health innovation, provided it meets strict quality and privacy requirements.






































































Enhancing health care through health data







The analysis of great quantities of health data can produce evidence for policy, strategy and resource planning, and clinical innovations.





The reliability of data-driven insights depends on the quality of the health data under analysis, the reliability of the digital health systems used and the trustworthy approaches applied by data workers.























































Create trust







You want to raise awareness and knowledge, within and outside of your organisation, of the importance to re-use health data, and produce evidence you do so in trustworthy ways.
                                  






You need to access and combine data from several sources. It is essential that you be confident and create confidence when exchanging health data with stakeholders and partners or when relying on data from a diversity of
                                  medical technology devices.






































Demonstrate accountability of your health data outcomes




























Health and data strategy organisations:
                      How robust is your health data approach?






Are you sure all measures are in place in order to 













































Be confident you produce reliable insights





















A continuous cycle of data improvement






Health data is a major asset to your business. It is essential that data quality checks and improvement cycles be integrated in your organisations daily routines.



























We provide you with instruments, insights and strategies to know and enhance your data quality








































Improve your access to reliable real-world data





















Combine and collate health data






You want to select the appropriate real-world data fast and easy. However, real-world health data is often not fit for the intended re-use purposes.
Health data providers can therefore have their specific data sets benchmarked against your quality criteria so as to check whether they are fit for your objective.



























We verify that health data is fit for purpose













































Comply with all data protection regulations





















Create clarity and alignment






Health data is the most personal and sensitive information. Its use is tightly governed.
GDPR compliance is a challenge that has to interplay with other aspects of information governance such as ethics, security and contractual obligations.
In addition, the assurance of the processes, tools and practices that are in force when using a health ICT system is essential.
And finally, you want to educate your staff to ensure they understand and adhere to your practices and policies.



























We conduct conformity assessments against a unique set of European criteria
























We organise GDPR tutorials


































Produce the necessary quality labels





















Create certified trust

Health data is driving innovation.
The growing awareness, acceptance and eagerness for stepping up the uses of health data does require industry players to provide evidence of the quality and trustworthiness of their health data handling.
Give yourself the tools to confirm your legitimate position in the health data ecosystem.






































































Be ready for new opportunities







Be prepared for challenging evolutions and requirements such as the rise of mHealth and A.I., the increasing need for connecting digital health systems, escalating demands by customers and regulators
Enhance your reputation in an expanding market by showing accountability for the outcomes of your activities
Optimise your efficiency by improving the quality of your internal processes




















































Create trust







Be confident and create confidence when exchanging health data with stakeholders and partners
Be reassured when receiving and relying on health data from a diversity of medical technology devices
Prepare your organisation for demands to demonstrate your privacy-compliant data handling

Be confident you produce reliable data





















A continuous cycle of data improvement






Health data is the very core of your business. It is essential that data quality checks and improvement cycles be integrated in your companys daily routines.



























We provide you with instruments, insights and strategies to know and enhance your data quality








































Improve your access to reliable real-world data





















Combine and collate health data






You want to select the appropriate real-world data fast and easy. However, real-world health data is often not fit for the intended re-use purposes.
Health data providers can therefore have their specific data sets benchmarked against your quality criteria so as to check whether they are fit for your objective.



























We verify that health data is fit for purpose













































Comply with all data protection regulations





















Create clarity and alignment






Health data is the most personal and sensitive information. Its use is tightly governed.
GDPR compliance is a challenge that has to interplay with other aspects of information governance such as ethics, security and contractual obligations.
In addition, the assurance of the processes, tools and practices that are in force when using a health ICT system is essential.
And finally, you want to educate your staff to ensure they understand and adhere to your practices and policies.



























We conduct conformity assessments against a unique set of European criteria
























We organise GDPR tutorials


































Make sure data from different sources can be connected





















Facilitate seamless sharing






Thetransfer of health data from one ICT health system to another similar system is necessary to allow for better individual care provision and for big data analysis.
i~HD is active in promoting the development and use of interoperability standards through EC Support Actions and innovation projects, awareness campaigns, guides and educational materials for professionals and decision makers.

Comply with the relevant functional criteria





















Stay on top of the fast-changing requirements






The requirements of state-of-the-art health software are multiplying and becoming more and more complex.
Users (both organisations and citizens),commissioners and health authorities want guarantees that health software operates in accordance with the relevant functional criteria.
i~HD has access to a repository of over 1700 indexed fine-grained validated criteria. Furthermore, as new criteria sets are being developed by stakeholders in the health ICT ecosystem, we step in to help define the
                                      criteria and to go through the validation phase that is required before integration in a standardised scheme.

                                        being developed by stakeholders in the health ICT ecosystem, we step in to help define the criteria and to go through the validation phase that is required before integration in a standardised scheme.

We endorse quality and trustworthiness





















There is a growing demand from individuals and businesses alike to see evidence of the quality and trustworthiness of health data and health data handling.
Within our programmes we have developed the following types of quality labels, which we are further expanding:







i~HD Certificates
i~HD Seals
i~HD Qualifications































We award seals and certificates

The analysis of health data from large numbers of patients is a vital resource to help to discover knowledge that can be used to improve health, health care and research.












































Sources of health data






There are many different kinds of data that are useful for discovering new knowledge, such as:







electronic health records of patients within hospitals and general practices
information entered by patients and healthy people using mobile applications
data from other public services, like transport, climate and pollution.






















































Users of health data






This data analysis, under strict data protection rules, and the development of new knowledge is undertaken by a wide range of public bodies and by industry, including:







universities and research centres
public health agencies
regulatory authorities
pharmaceutical companies
medical device manufacturers.














































Transparency






i~HD is encouraging these organisations to publish the results of their analyses, and to make clear how they have used data when developing a new medicine or device or software product, so
                      the public can see the value of how their data have been used.
Alongside this, we are encouraging these organisations to explain how they have protected the data whilst undertaking their analysis.





























Discover real-world examples




























It is often helpful to understand the many possible uses of data through examples. We have collected together case studies that illustrate different uses of data, for different disease areas, by different organisations and to discover knowledge that leads to different kinds of benefit.















We are building up a library of these case studies, by contacting many organisations across Europe so that we can present brief summaries and link to their case study details. We are particularly grateful to
                      ,
                      , and
                       for providing case studies for our library.

The European Institute for Innovation through Health Data (i~HD) is in unison with the 35-member strong coalition of health stakeholder organisations in highlighting some concerns on the proposed European Health Data Space (EHDS) regulation. The coalition believes that the regulation has the potential to harness the benefits of the digital age for better health outcomes. However, the group is also raising ten fundamental issues that have not been addressed in the lead-up to the negotiations between the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission.


The coalition believes that the regulation has the potential to harness the benefits of the digital age for better health outcomes. However, the group is also raising ten fundamental issues that have not been addressed in the lead-up to the negotiations between the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission.
These ten issues are:

The EHDS must set forth clearer and more coherent definitions (e.g. on electronic health data, data holder, electronic health record system)
The EHDS must clarify its interaction with other applicable legal frameworks (including GDPR, Data Governance Act, Data Act, Medical Devices Regulation)
The EHDS must harmonise rules, reduce legal fragmentation and ensure that the regulation can be implemented consistently across the EU
The EHDS must specify the scope of electronic health data categories for secondary use.
The EHDS should avoid any opt-in and only incorporate an opt-out mechanism as long as it does not lead to inconsistent implementation, increased health data disparities and excessive administrative burdens. The relevant legal bases under the GDPR should be leveraged and applied in a harmonised way across Member States
The EHDS should safeguard and incentivise health research and innovation activities that are performed in line with the existing regulatory frameworks
The EHDS should leverage existing health data infrastructures, set up by health institutions and stakeholders, to allow continuity and build on existing expertise
The EHDS should avoid excessive data localisation and international health data transfer restrictions that go beyond the requirements of the GDPRs framework
The EHDS should involve all relevant health stakeholders from the outset of the implementation process and include them in its governance at both EU and Member State levels
The EHDS must provide adequate resources and incentives to facilitate its successful implementation. It should be accompanied by policies promoting digital health skills and tools for health professionals, patients and citizens

For months now, i~HD has consistently been involved in different engagements and symposia together with the coalition to discuss the EHDS proposal. In 2022, the organisation  of the EHDS through Towards European Health Data Space or TEHDAS. Later that year, i~HD also co-signed a  by the same coalition. Last year, EHDS was one of the .

Big Data for Health & Care: The Arisal of Data Spaces









 

















      
The European Institute for Innovation through Health Data (i~HD) and the University of Hasselt (UHasselt) are co-organising a one-day symposium called Big Data for Health & Care: The Arisal of Data Spaces.

WHEN: 23 April 2024WHERE:  Corda Campus, Hasselt, Belgium
With this symposium, we aspire to facilitate an in-depth exploration of data spaces and research infrastructures, elucidate challenges and best practices for large-scale projects, and engage in a panel debate on the feasibility of implementing and integrating various data spaces at different levels, all underpinning the advancement of healthcare data sharing and research.
The symposium is tailored for health data enthusiasts from Belgium and neighboring countries. While expecting diverse attendees, both beginners and experts, we are aiming for accessibility without compromising depth.
The event plans to highlight different Belgian data spaces and to delve into profound discussions during panel debates, exploring complex topics like challenges and future perspectives in health data sharing and analysis. As i~HD will co-moderate the event, the bridge towards Europe is guaranteed.

Health data has proven to be a crucial enabler in the development of innovative health, care and research solutions.






This process was facilitated by new digital ways for collecting, storing, exchanging, and analysing health data, meaning it can be reused not just for a second time but even more, not only by the person who collected the information
                    but also by other clinicians, researchers and health authorities. The benefits of secondary use of health data have been widely discussed and acknowledged/recognised and yet, the main challenge remains on how we can create trust in
                    the health ecosystem for the reuse of this health data. 















Coming fresh from the success of our last conference in 2022
                    , i~HD is announcing its Annual Conference 2023. The emphasis of the conference in 2022 was to demonstrate the importance of Data Quality, an important condition for the
                    trustworthy use and re-use of health data. Aside from taking off from the key points discussed during that conference, the 2023 conference will provide participants with a broader scope for enabling trust in the secondary use of health
                    data. It is great to have and use and reuse health data, but what do we need so that all stakeholders can also trust the reuse of health data? i~HD will present its holistic view showing all important health data challenges to be solved
                    in order to trustworthy use and reuse of high-quality data to continuously improve care and accelerate research.

The i~HD Quality Labels endorse you to showcase your quality and your trustworthiness





















The re-use of health data has become crucial to enhance health and speed up research, creating a myriad of societal benefits. But along with this comes the challenge for organisations to prove the quality and trustworthiness of their
                      health data handling, at the level of ICT systems, organisations, people and data itself.










Producing evidence to convince

















































i~HD quality labels for health data handling






Within our programmes we have developed the following types of quality labels, which we are further expanding:






















i~HD Certificates






i~HD certificates prove, guarantee and assure that the assessed health data product, process or service is conform with the pre-defined and accredited standard.
















i~HD Seals






i~HD seals prove, guarantee and assure that the assessed health data product, process or service complies with the (self-)defined assessment objective and scope.
















i~HD Qualifications






i~HD qualifications prove, guarantee and assure that a participant has successfully followed and/or passed an i~HD course or tutorial.





























Benefits of obtaining an i~HD quality label






An i~HD quality label will allow your organisation to:








 
demonstrate the conformity of your products, services, organisational processes and practices with specified requirements outlined in standardised schemes based on validated criteria. 









enhance your reputation with users, regulators, industry and all other interested stakeholders and boost your customer satisfaction









facilitate trade, market access, fair competition and consumer acceptance at a national and international level and in an expanding health systems landscape









improve the quality of the internal processes



































Types of quality labels






 i~HD currently hands out the following quality labels:
































IG 1/2020 Certificate


























Organisations that successfully pass the conformity assessment with the i~HD Information Governance Certification Programme standard IG 1/2020 will be awarded the IG 1/2020 Certificate.
This certificate assures that the processes, services, tools and practices of the health ICT system and its organisation meet the validated criteria relating to accountability, audit readiness, data processing, corrective action
                              capability, documentary compliance, privacy, ethics, security, data protection & GDPR compliance.






























Data Quality Champion Seal


























The outcome of the improvement assessment is the i~HD Data Quality Champion Seal. 
Through our Data Quality Champion Programme, we assist you in better understanding your data and subsequently implementing customised and future-proof processes integrated in your companys daily routines.






























Data Quality Benchmarking Seal


























The outcome of the Data Quality Benchmarking assessment is the Data Quality Benchmarking Seal.
Through our Data Quality Benchmark Programme, we can perform a formal benchmarking of your dataset against quality criteria that are defined by an (external) stakeholder initiative. We can also assess the fitness of your data
                              for a given purpose.

Why use and re-use health data?




























Health data has proved to be a crucial enabler in the development of innovative health, care and research solutions.
This process was facilitated by new digital ways for collecting, storing, exchanging and analysing health data, meaning it can be re-used a second time, and more, not only by the person who collected the information but also by other
                      clinicians, researchers and health authorities.

Sources of health data






When hearing about health data, most people think of the medical information that is introduced in their health records during visits to their GP or hospital. But there is more. Health data registration is all around and rapidly growing:







through remote monitoring devices prescribed by health professionals
over personal tracking devices such as fitness apps or dietary monitoring
to major national health databases.

Trustworthy use and re-use of high-quality health data





















The exponential growth of health data will allow for life-saving breakthroughs
if we manage to make good (re-)use of good data.

Reliable re-use of data






Real-world health data is usually captured and structured for its primary objective of providing safe and personalised care to each individual patient.
It needs to be fit for the intended re-use purposes!
Some critical requirements for optimal re-use involve the quality, the interoperability and the trustworthy handling of health data.


























Quality of health data







Is the health data that is being analysed accurate?
Is it representative of the population under scrutiny?
Has it been introduced in a consistent and correct way?























INFORMATION GOVERNANCE

How can organisations successfully integrate GDPR regulations into daily routines?
How can health data be safely handled through trustworthy health ICT systems?























TRUSTWORTHINESS OF HEALTH ICT SYSTEMS







How can healthICT systems that handle data be conceived and used in ways that meet the highest data privacy requirements?
Does the system function as it was meant to function?

How can stakeholders share challenges and solutions to scale up the uses of health data?








































As a multi-stakeholder organisation,i~HD can leverage understanding and facilitate scaled-up, judicious data sharing and re-use.






















Learn why health data is important for each stakeholder group







































Patients, caregivers, patient representatives, citizens and population health / prevention organisations







When all your health professionals have access to your up-to-date health data, they are able to provide more efficient, higher quality, safer and more personalised care and care coordination.
When you have access to your health data, you can better manage your own health.
Health data provided to scientific research will speed up the development of new medical products and treatments for individuals who need them.
































Judicious use of health data will boost health care providers ability to become learning health systems and facilitate:







the delivery of safer evidence-based care and improve health outcomes
a more efficient use of health care resources
participation in more clinical research and allow for more inhouse research



























By analysing great numbers of health data, health policy makers and funders can:







give recognition to high-quality and value-based care
better guide ongoing healthcare and prevention programmes
improve public health strategy and plan for the future






















Pharmaceutical and life science organisations are bringing health care research and innovation to a higher level through the analysis of high-quality real-world data and research data. They therefore:







need to raise awareness of the importance of re-using health data
demonstrate the trustworthiness and privacy-compliance of their own data handling and systems
collaborate with data providers whose data and systems have been validated as well.























The implementation of interoperabilitystandards has become vital to facilitate the transfer of health
                              data between health ICT systems and the sharing of health data for secondary use.
Certification organisations perform audits so as to provide an objective evaluation of the trustworthiness or quality of health data or health ICT systems used by research platforms, health apps, governments, care professionals
                              etc.



















With a growing interest in sharing and re-using health data and the rise of new digital health technologies, the health ICT industry is challenged by an increased demand for value-added interoperable solutions for the trustworthy
                            capture, management, exchange and analysis of high quality data.


















Whether the aim is to participate in clinical research, to build and share knowledge, to respond to local and nation-wide health challenges or to prevent sickness and disease, high-quality and trustworthy health data catalyses
                            the opportunities for academics and research centers to stay on top of their game.


















Health & data strategy organisations both rely on and provide operational and strategic advice, business intelligence,
                            data warehouse services etc. to address a broad range of health care challenges. The quality of these services is generally directly linked to the presence and the trustworthiness of health data.


















The growing importance of health data has led to new opportunities for the data-driven industry: wearables, AI, brokerage services  In order to gain wide-spread credibility and trust, this sector needs to meet strict requirements
                            and produce evidence related to their trustworthiness and the quality of the data they use.

Raising trust between all stakeholders is one of i~HDs key objectives

Digital health information is booming andcreating exciting opportunities! Patients can now benefit from life-changing
                      innovations that were only made possible because many millions of people decided to share their health data.
                      
                      However, health is a very sensitive topic. There is a growing demand by individuals and businesses alike to see evidence of the quality and trustworthiness of health data that is being
                      .

Health care is becoming more and more complex and specialised. Besides our GP, we are likely to consult one or more hospital clinicians, home care or social care workers and other health professionals, either for personal health issues or for a close relative. Or we may need emergency care in another region of the country or abroad where swift access to our essential health information may be crucial to determine the outcome of the treatment we need.
When all of these health professionals have access to our up-to-date health data and are aware of the treatments we were prescribed by other members of the care team, they will be able to provide higher-quality and more personalised care. Better coordination will make care provision safer and more efficient as it will make it possible to reduce medical visits, avoid redundant exams and prevent duplicate or even conflicting treatments.




































With the rise of data-driven health tools such as wearable devices, remote monitoring, mobile health apps and shared electronic health records, people are more closely connected to tracking their own health.
Having access to our health data, provides the insights to better manage our health. This understanding will give us a stronger voice interacting with our care team to jointly make the best decisions and to define an
                                      appropriate care plan taking into account personal priorities.
Being an informed partner in our own care will also boost motivation to carefully follow up on medical instructions and adopt the necessary lifestyle changes.
Moreover, active patient engagement has proven to lead to better health outcomes and better care experiences.




































Researchers and clinicians need large quantities of health data to understand disease, its causes, its progression over time, the treatments that have been (un)successful.
The analysis of health data of millions of people helps them to forecast health trends, to speed up diagnosis, to discover new and more effective treatments, medicines and medical technologies, to personalise care,
                                      to roll out Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) applications.
The health data susceptible to boost health research has often been routinely collected in electronic health records kept by clinicians, but also in population registries, and more recently through mobile health trackers,
                                      bio sensors, etc.
Conversely, patients may be invited to participate in clinical trials for researchers to gather very targeted health data, opening opportunities for patients to get acces tothe newest medical advancements.




































Hospitals and other health care providers are facing the ever harder challenge of delivering high-quality but cost-effective services in an increasingly complex health care environment. 
Health authorities and funders are forced to ensure sustainable, future proof care strategies, carefully balancing budgets against increasing demands.
The analysis of great quantities of health data can help health care providers to improve quality and safety, efficiency and performance, planning and care pathway optimisation.
Public health decision makers can rely on big data analysis to produce evidence for policy and resource planning, for public health surveillance and strategy.














































How health privacy is protected





















People may worry about the privacy and security of their sensitive health information.

How can access to personal health data be limited to authorised persons?
What measures do health data users take to safeguard their ICT infrastructures against cyberattacks?
Will personal data not be used for other purposes?

There are legal, organisational and technical precautions to protect the identity of individuals when data is used, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ethical codes of conduct, rules for anonymizing data, access
                      controls, audit trails etc.
As it is our ambition to foster legitimate trust in data sharing, we have developed expertise to assist all stakeholders to comply with regulatory requirements and ethical standards.

Health systems across Europe are facing huge challenges and need to adapt rapidly in order to remain sustainable whilst improving quality,
                      by developing future proof care and research strategies, optimising the efficient use of resources.

Data-driven insights are crucial to support the current and future health and research challenges and enhance public health.









































The returns of health care funding can be optimised through the scaled-up, judicious use of health data.

Health policy makers & funders:
                      How to put health data to good use?






To guarantee the best uses of health data, you need to be confident of 














































Encourage health care users to improve and demonstrate their data quality





















For better insights and decision making






Several studies have demonstrated that health data is not always of a good enough quality or fit for the intended re-use purposes.
Health data is traditionally captured by healthcare providers and provider organisations, but increasingly also by medical devices, sensors and health apps directly by patients.
Encouraging these organisations and suppliers to meet data quality assurance criteria will ensure you have reliable evidence to develop better and more efficient health care services and prevention programmes.



























We provide instruments, insights and strategies to know, enhance and benchmark data quality









































Create reassurance in the ways health data is used





















Promote GDPR understanding and adherence






Health data is the most personal and sensitive information. Yet, it is crucial to enhancing health care and boosting research. Health data use is therefore tightly governed. The privacy regulations need to be well understood
                                      and carefully applied.
One way to create assurance is to disseminate knowledge and promote adherence to the GDPR. 



























We organise health-data-focused GDPR tutorials













































Endorse privacy-compliant health ICT systems





















Promote safe digitisation of health care






Digital health systems now connect to an increasing number of other systems and platforms. Every data custodian needs to be confident about what they connect to and every patient needs to be able to trust their data
                                      is safe within those systems.
Having the privacy, ethics, security and data protection processes of health ICT systems assessed, will contribute to a trusted health data system.



























We assess the privacy, ethics, security and data protection processes of health ICT systems.













































Validate digital health systems that demonstrate their reliable functional operation





















Selection of criteria and assessment






The requirements of state-of-the-art health software are multiplying and becoming more and more complex.
Users (both organisations and citizens),commissioners and health authorities want guarantees that health software operates in accordance with the relevant functional criteria.
i~HD has access to a repository of over 1700 indexed fine-grained validated criteria. Furthermore, as new criteria sets are being developed by stakeholders in the health ICT ecosystem, we step in to help define the
                                      criteria and to go through the validation phase that is required before integration in a standardised scheme.




























Our programmes cover the functional testing of health software








































Have confidence in the validity of quality labels





















i~HD can help produce the necessary evidence by issuing different types of quality labels.
We bring over 30 years of learning and expertise in our quality labels. Our team of auditors have clinical, technical, academic and legal backgrounds and have
substantial expertise in developing quality seals,backed by a robust assessment methodology and criteria.

Pharmaceutical companies and the life sciences industry rely on both research data and real-world data to conduct ground-breaking health care research and to bring innovation to a higher level.









































































Improve your access to reliable real-world data






You want to raise awareness of the importance of re-using health data.
You want to rely on real-world health data that meets the criteria you have defined and that is fit for your research purposes.



















































Create trust






You want to produce evidence that you are handling high-quality health data in a privacy-compliant way.
You want to show accountability for the outcomes of your research.

A continuous cycle of data improvement






Health data is the very core of your business. It is essential that data quality checks and improvement cycles be integrated in your companys daily routines.



























We provide you with instruments, insights and strategies to know and enhance your data quality








































Improve your access to real-world data





















Increased research eligibility for health data providers






You want to select the appropriate real-world data fast and easy. However, real-world health data is often not fit for the intended re-use purposes.
Health data providers can therefore have their specific data sets benchmarked against your quality criteria so as to check whether they are fit for your research objective.



























We verify that health data is fit for purpose













































Comply with all data protection regulations





















Create clarity and alignment






Health data is the most personal and sensitive information. Its use is tightly governed.
GDPR compliance is a challenge that has to interplay with other aspects of information governance such as ethics, security and contractual obligations.
In addition, the assurance of the processes, tools and practices that are in force when using a health ICT system is essential.
And finally, you want to educate your staff to ensure they understand and adhere to your practices and policies.



























We conduct conformity assessments against a unique set of European criteria

Demonstrate the trustworthiness of your digital health systems




























The soaring use of health data is reflected in the growing adoption of digital health systems and applications, from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) used by health care providers & organisations
                      to fitness and health apps readily accessible for all citizens.
The need to capture and manage health data in trustworthy ways has forced the health ict industry to meet complex and high requirements.





































































Health authorities rely on data-driven insights to design future proof health care strategies. In addition, they start endorsing mobile health apps, and even provide for reimbursement, for apps that meet the highest requirements.









































Health care providers rely on EHR data to deliver evidence-based care and optimise care coordination. EHR systems need to allow for proper analysis while safeguarding patient privacy.









































Researchers and clinicians want to conduct large-scale data analysis to speed up health innovations. Seamless exchanging or connecting and quality of data are crucial requirements. 









































Patients and citizens are more and more convinced of the added value of digital health, and willing to embrace this, provided data protection and smooth operation are ensured.

Stay on top of the fast-changing requirements






The requirements of state-of-the-art health software are multiplying and becoming more and more complex.
Users (both organisations and citizens),commissioners and health authorities want guarantees that your software operates in accordance with the relevant functional criteria.
i~HD has access to a repository of over 1700 indexed fine-grained validated criteria. Furthermore, as new criteria sets are being developed by stakeholders in the health ICT ecosystem, we step in to help define the
                                      criteria and to go through the validation phase that is required before integration in a standardised scheme.



























Our programmes cover the functional testing of health software








































Make sure the data in your system can be linked and connected





















Facilitate seamless sharing






Thetransfer of health data from one ICT health system to another similar system is necessary to allow for better individual care provision and for big data analysis.
i~HD is active in promoting the development and use of interoperability standards through EC Support Actions and innovation projects, awareness campaigns, guides and educational materials for professionals and decision makers.

A continuous cycle of data improvement






Health data is the very core of your business. It is essential that data quality checks and improvement cycles be integrated in your companys daily routines.



























We provide you with instruments, insights and strategies to know and enhance your data quality








































Improve your access to reliable real-world data





















Combine and collate health data






You want to select the appropriate real-world data fast and easy. However, real-world health data is often not fit for the intended re-use purposes.
Health data providers can therefore have their specific data sets benchmarked against your quality criteria so as to check whether they are fit for your objective.

Health data is the most personal and sensitive information. Its use is tightly governed.
GDPR compliance is a challenge that has to interplay with other aspects of information governance such as ethics, security and contractual obligations.
In addition, the assurance of the processes, tools and practices that are in force when using a health ICT system is essential.
And finally, you want to educate your staff to ensure they understand and adhere to your practices and policies.



























We conduct conformity assessments against a unique set of European criteria
























We organise GDPR tutorials

Stay on top of the fast-changing requirements






The requirements of state-of-the-art health software are multiplying and becoming more and more complex.
Users (both organisations and citizens),commissioners and health authorities want guarantees that health software operates in accordance with the relevant functional criteria.
i~HD has access to a repository of over 1700 indexed fine-grained validated criteria. Furthermore, as new criteria sets are being developed by stakeholders in the health ICT ecosystem, we step in to help define the
                                      criteria and to go through the validation phase that is required before integration in a standardised scheme.

Get the right insights






Learning from the health data that is stored in your patients EHRs is the foundation for clinical, operational and strategic decision-making.
The quality of your decision-making is linked to the quality of your health data.However, the quality of this data is not always what you might expect.



























We provide you with instruments, insights and strategies to know and enhance your data quality

Health data is the most personal and sensitive information. Its use is tightly governed.
GDPR compliance is a challenge that has to interplay with other aspects of information governance such as ethics, security and contractual obligations.
In addition, the assurance of the processes, tools and practices that are in force when using a health ICT system is essential.
And finally, you want to educate your staff to ensure they understand and adhere to your practices and policies.

Create trustworthy health intelligence to lead the way




























Health care systems and organisations are constantly balancing exciting opportunities such as the introduction of new technologies and medicines, the development of A.I. algorithms and more personalised care against the threats of
                      soaring health care expenditure and calls for more accountability, to name just a few.
Health data is often at the heart of operational, strategic and clinical insights, business intelligence and data warehouse services that support health innovation, provided it meets strict quality and privacy requirements.






































































Enhancing health care through health data







The analysis of great quantities of health data can produce evidence for policy, strategy and resource planning, and clinical innovations.





The reliability of data-driven insights depends on the quality of the health data under analysis, the reliability of the digital health systems used and the trustworthy approaches applied by data workers.























































Create trust







You want to raise awareness and knowledge, within and outside of your organisation, of the importance to re-use health data, and produce evidence you do so in trustworthy ways.
                                  






You need to access and combine data from several sources. It is essential that you be confident and create confidence when exchanging health data with stakeholders and partners or when relying on data from a diversity of
                                  medical technology devices.

                      re-register to receive newsletters should you change your mind and wish to hear from us again.







Registering to attend an i~HD event and subsequent management of that event






When registering to attend an i~HD event via our website or directly with our offices, we ask for your title, first and last names, your function in your company or institution, email address, the company or institution you belong
                      to, your role and the country you are based in. We ask you to select which of our core stakeholder groups you belong to. Furthermore, we ask you to provide us with your dietary preferences and any specific needs to cater for your
                      attendance at our events. We do not ask for any other details, personal or otherwise.
When registering, i~HD processes your personal data to manage your attendance at our event with your explicit consent as a legal basis under Article 6(1)(a) of GDPR.
Once you have registered, we do not add you to a published attendance list unless we have obtained your explicit consent to do so under Article 6(1)(a) of GDPR.
i~HD retains your personal data to fulfil the purpose of managing your attendance at our event and for audit purposes after the event under Article 6(1)(c) of GDPR for legal obligation.
i~HD will add you to its contact list if you are not already on it to keep you informed on newsletters, further events and updates to i~HDs services. i~HD processes your contact details as we believe it is in your and i~HDs legitimate
                      interests under Article 6(1)(f). Should you wish to unsubscribe from this list at any point, you can do so at your convenience by
                      .







Sharing updates about our events






Where you have agreed to be a speaker, we process your personal data on our website to publicise our events and to share updates about the event once it has finished. The data we share will be your full name, your organisation, title,
                      function, a photograph and a short bio that you will provide us. Should you share this with us, we will also share links to your social media platform profiles. 
We process this personal data for the purposes of publicising the event and delivering it. The legal basis under GDPR is Article 6(1)(f) where in agreeing to be a speaker, i~HD has identified that it is in our and your legitimate interests
                      for us to process the data for these purposes. You may of course object to or restrict this processing (as described in the rights section below) and if you prefer us to remove your personal data from the website or refrain from
                      using it in newsletters, we will honour your rights as defined in GDPR to the fullest extent. 
Should you decide to withdraw as a speaker prior to the event, we will destroy the personal data and if you prefer we withhold any of the data from the website we will of course refrain from putting it there. 
Our events are recorded either through the filming of speakers, panels and audience members, audio recording or photograph for the purposes of updating our members and the wider public about our event. Under GDPR Article 6(1)(a) we
                      seek the explicit consent from any participants that we record in any way for this specific purpose. 
The consent is entirely freely given and you are free to grant it or not as you see fit without any impact on your participation in the event. 
You may withdraw your consent for the recording and as soon as you do, we will remove the recording from public display immediately and provided we do not have to retain it under other legal obligation, destroy it without the need
                      for any explanation from you at all. We cannot however remove names of speakers or panellists from a past agenda or meeting report as documenting a past fact where these are provided on our websites under events. 







Details of our task force members, committees and core team members






Where you have agreed to become a member of one of our task forces or committees, we will share your name, organisation, title, function, a photo and a short bio, as well as links to your social media profiles on the relevant website
                      pages and in our newsletters. Where you are a member of our core team, we will share personal data including your name, a short bio title, function, photo and email address on our website and newsletters. 
In both cases, we will do this under Article 6(1)(f) where i~HD has identified that it is in both our and your legitimate interests to publicise this on the website and in newsletters. You may of course object to or restrict this processing
                      (as described in the rights section below) and if you prefer us to remove your personal data from the website or refrain from using it in newsletters, we will honour your rights as defined in GDPR to the fullest extent. 







Handling communications from you about i~HD






When you contact us either from our
                      or directly, we will process your personal data for the purposes of handling the reason for your contacting us.
Where your reason for contacting us is about your existing membership i~HD will handle your personal data under Article 6(1)(b) for the performance of a contract or its preparation.
If your query is general or with regards your rights under GDPR, this will be with your explicit consent under Article 6(1)(a) of GDPR. We will retain a record of your query for one year for audit purposes. We will also add your contact
                      details to our contact list but only if you explicitly consent to this in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) of GDPR.







Running our services






i~HD will handle the contact details for clients we provide services to, which includes Data Quality and Data Security and Protection Assessments, the i~HD Academy and the preparation of Tutorials. For all these purposes unless otherwise
                      specified, i~HD will process the contact person(s) name, email address, role and the details of the organisations they work for. Where i~HD conducts interviews as part of its services, we will retain the name and role of any interviewees.
                      Where i~HD runs tutorials, we process the names and emails of attendees. For the Academy, i~HD requires your Full Name, email address, Town/City and Country of Residence to register for Moodle. Please note that you may if you wish
                      add more details under your profile, you are free to do so according to the terms of enrolment in the Academy. Please note that i~HD does not require the processing of Special Category Data for these services so please bear this
                      in mind when adding profile details to the Academy or engaging with us around the other services.
The legal bases under which we process personal data for these purposes will depend on the nature of the service and will be specified within the agreements we sign with you. The legal basis will be for either legal obligation under
                      6(1)(C) of GDPR or performance of a contract or its preparation and is covered as a legal basis under Article 6(1)(b) of GDPR. When handling special category data, specific Article 9(2) justifications will be provided as part of
                      our agreements.
Where running Data Quality Assessments, i~HD will only receive anonymous data. For additional rigour and in the event of accidental re-identification of data subjects, i~HD acts as a data processor only under contract with the data
                      controller where all data handled by i~HD will be securely transferred and held in an encrypted state using 256bit Advanced Encryption Standard encryption within an access controlled, dedicated and audited Office 365 Sharepoint Space.
When you register for the i~HD Academy, please note that we contract with Avetica to serve as a Data Processor under our instruction to configure and maintain the Moodle Platform we use to serve you with the educational and assessment
                      materials. You may review Aveticas details at
                       and you will find out more about how Moodle handles your personal information at
                      .







Participating in EU Funded Projects






i-HD will handle personal data during its participation in EU Funded projects. In these cases, the categories, legal bases and Article 9 Justifications will be specified in the appropriate agreement documents and information leaflets.
                      







What are my rights?






At all times, GDPR gives you the following rights which we will of course honour in full compliance with its provisions: 







the right to request access to any of your personal data that i~HD processes;
the right to data portability where you can request a digital copy of the data for your own uses;
the right to the rectification (correction) of your personal data where it is incorrect;
the right to request erasure of your data as outlined by GDPR;
the right to restriction of processing by i~HD including where you identify and raise a problem with the data processing until the problem is resolved;
the right to object at any time to processing of your personal data including that which is based on Article 6(1) (f) of GDPR where we have identified a legitimate interest.







Where the processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time and without any reason. Withdrawing your consent means that i~HD will not make use of your data any longer for the purposes
                      that you consented to. This does not invalidate past uses of your personal data for which you gave consent and your personal data will continue to be processed in the event of any legal obligations that i~HD must meet.
Please send an email to the data protection officer atdpo@i-hd.euto exercise any of your rights. i~HD must confirm your identity and will review your request to ensure that it can be honoured without compromising other legal requirements
                      and pursuant to the limitations provided by GDPR. We aim to have replied within 30 days of your request except where you have withdrawn your consent, which shall be actioned immediately.

Updates to how we process data and this notice






If we substantially change how we process your data (for example using a new tool or service provider) we will undertake a Data Protection Impact Assessment pursuant to GDPR Article 35. This would be the case if we identify that any
                      changes require significant additional processing of your personal data and / or risks to your rights and freedoms. 
Where we identify a clear need to update this notice we will inform you immediately.

Data Retention Policy






i~HD retains personal data according to the following guidelines:
1. i~HD processes personal data for specific purposes as defined in our Data Protection and Transparency Notice and will only retain personal data for as long as is necessary to complete these purposes and satisfy legal requirements.
2. Where we are required to retain data after the retention period for each purpose has expired, we will post a notice. These purposes may include dispute resolution, in the case of legal obligation (for example as ordered by a court
                      or if it is used in a criminal investigation).
3. Where possible, we will retain data using pseudonymised data after we have completed the purposes for which it is being processed.
4. When retention requirements under law have expired, personal data will be destroyed using a secure deletion method as offered by Microsoft Office 365 licensing and where possible all data will be removed from any backups that have
                      been created. Once deleted, any personal data will be irretrievable.

Health data has the potential to catalysesmarter health careandefficient research.
We need to urgently ramp up our learning by creating and combininghigh-quality health data and advocating itstrustworthy uses.

As a neutral, multi-stakeholder instituteThe European Institute for Innovation through Health Data strives tomaximise community value from health data.
That is why we promote, develop and share good practices and tools and perform quality assessments.

QUALITY OF
                                HEALTH DATA






























Health data is often not fit for crucial reuse purposes such as clinical research, decision making, value-based health care. We therefore catalyse stakeholders to scale up their data quality, by coaching, educating and equipping
                                them with instruments, organising assessments, providing insights and strategies to benchmark and enhance their health data quality, and providing expert support in all phases of the research lifecycle.




























































INFORMATION
                                GOVERNANCE






























All organisations, and the public, need to trust the ways in which health data is used, and by whom. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has heightened our awareness of this. We have translated our expertise in data protection for reuse purposes into codes of practices, educational and certification programmes, which we provide to organisations and European projects.

























































TRUSTWORTHY
                                HEALTH ICT SYSTEMS






























With more and more health ICT systems collecting and exchanging health data, we see a growing demand to demonstrate the trustworthiness of those systems. Using 1700 criteria and a standardised conformity assessment framework, we assess and certify the quality and governance of health ICT platforms.




























































DATA
                                INTEROPERABILITY
                                STANDARDS






























Interoperability standards are vital to scaling up health data use, even more so given the rise of patient and citizen generated data. i~HD staff and experts have a long history of developing international health data interoperability standards, and their adoption into products and health ecosystems, connecting clinical information between silos to enable safer and more effective patient care, and big data research.

























































QUALITY LABELS:
                                CERTIFICATES & SEALS






























Organisations handling health data want to provide assurance they do so in trustworthy ways. i~HD programmes offer audits for data, ICT systems, information governance and skills. As an independent institute, i~HD is best positioned to award quality labels to stakeholders that showcase their engagement, quality and accountability. 




























































SCALING UP

We know that everybody needs to do more, and invest more, in health data through improved models of healthcare delivery, patient empowerment, and the development of innovative diagnostics and treatments. We help to stimulate this multi-stakeholder momentum to
                                collect, curate, share and analyse data across care and research, for the benefit of all.

Health data has the potential to catalysesmarter health careandefficient research.
We need to urgently ramp up our learning by creating and combininghigh-quality health data and advocating itstrustworthy uses.

As a neutral, multi-stakeholder instituteThe European Institute for Innovation through Health Data strives tomaximise community value from health data.
That is why we promote, develop and share good practices and tools and perform quality assessments.

QUALITY OF
                                HEALTH DATA






























Health data is often not fit for crucial reuse purposes such as clinical research, decision making, value-based health care. We therefore catalyse stakeholders to scale up their data quality, by coaching, educating and equipping
                                them with instruments, organising assessments, providing insights and strategies to benchmark and enhance their health data quality, and providing expert support in all phases of the research lifecycle.




























































INFORMATION
                                GOVERNANCE






























All organisations, and the public, need to trust the ways in which health data is used, and by whom. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has heightened our awareness of this. We have translated our expertise in data protection for reuse purposes into codes of practices, educational and certification programmes, which we provide to organisations and European projects.

























































TRUSTWORTHY
                                HEALTH ICT SYSTEMS






























With more and more health ICT systems collecting and exchanging health data, we see a growing demand to demonstrate the trustworthiness of those systems. Using 1700 criteria and a standardised conformity assessment framework, we assess and certify the quality and governance of health ICT platforms.




























































DATA
                                INTEROPERABILITY
                                STANDARDS






























Interoperability standards are vital to scaling up health data use, even more so given the rise of patient and citizen generated data. i~HD staff and experts have a long history of developing international health data interoperability standards, and their adoption into products and health ecosystems, connecting clinical information between silos to enable safer and more effective patient care, and big data research.

























































QUALITY LABELS:
                                CERTIFICATES & SEALS






























Organisations handling health data want to provide assurance they do so in trustworthy ways. i~HD programmes offer audits for data, ICT systems, information governance and skills. As an independent institute, i~HD is best positioned to award quality labels to stakeholders that showcase their engagement, quality and accountability.

We know that everybody needs to do more, and invest more, in health data through improved models of healthcare delivery, patient empowerment, and the development of innovative diagnostics and treatments. We help to stimulate this multi-stakeholder momentum to
                                collect, curate, share and analyse data across care and research, for the benefit of all.
