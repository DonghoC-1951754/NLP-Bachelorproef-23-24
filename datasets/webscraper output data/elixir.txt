ELIXIR is a European life sciences infrastructure, enabling researchers to access and analyse life science data, to improve the value and impact of life science research on public health, the environment and the economy.
ELIXIR brings together life science resources from across Europe. These resources include databases, software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.
The goal of ELIXIR is to coordinate these resources so that they form a single infrastructure. This infrastructure makes it easier for scientists to find and share data, exchange expertise, and agree on best practices. Ultimately, it will help them gain new insights into how living organisms work.

How we work
We bring scientists together from 23 countries and 220 research institutes. Our goal is to make life science data easier to find, share, aggregate and analyse.



Each country that is a member of ELIXIR has a "Node". A Node is the collection of research institutes that work for ELIXIR in that country. The Node institutes run national services and support local users. The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) is also a Node, but is an international organisation rather than a country.






Platforms bring together experts from Nodes to develop ELIXIRs technical vision and coordinate its technical activities.




Communities bring together experts to develop ELIXIRs vision and coordinate its activities within a particular life science domain.

 is an example of an ELIXIR resource. TeSS is online training portal that gathers life science training materials and training courses from across Europe, and allows you to search it in one website. This makes it easier for scientists to find the training they need, and gives the training courses wider publicity.
ELIXIR includes 22 members and threeObservers, bringing together over 240 research organisations. It was founded in December 2013 and began implementing its first scientific programme in 2014. It is currently implementing its thirdfive-year .

What we do








ELIXIR coordinates anddevelopslife science resources across Europe so that researchers can more easily find, analyse and share data, exchange expertise, and implement best practices. This makes it possible for them to gain greater insights into how living organisms work.
More details of what we do

Develop ways that researchersacross Europe can access, store, transfer and analyse large amounts of life science data. See the .
Identify key data resources across Europe and support the linkages between data and literature e.g. by making it easier to move from a scientific paper to the dataset that the paper was based on. See the .
Provide ways for researchers to find the best software to analyse their data. See the .
Establish Europe-wide standards that can be used to describe life science data. This makes different data sets easier to compare and analyse. See the .
Help scientists and developers find the training they need, and also provide that training. See the .
Develop communities, standards, databases and tools in selected life science domains (e.g. Marine Metagenomics, Human Data). See .

What are Platforms and Communities?
The scientific and technical activities in ELIXIR are run by five Platforms and a number of Communities (formerly called 'Use Cases'). Platforms bring together experts to define the strategy and provide services in a particular area e.g. training, data. Communities bring together scientists who work in a specific domain (e.g. Plant Sciences). These scientists develop services targeted for their own domains. They also give feedback on the services the Platforms provide, to make sure that the services solve real world problems. See  and .
Scientific strategy
The scientific direction of ELIXIR is laid out in the  and in annual Work Plans. The Work Plans describe the activities that take place in each year.

Who we are










Map of member states within ELIXIR. Each member state establishes a 'Node' in its country, which is a network of institutes that carry out the scientific and technical work of ELIXIR within that country. Orange = member states; pale orange = observers. Observers are countries working towards full membership. 

We are a European intergovernmental organisation that is made up of life scientists, computer scientists and support staff. Our goal is to help researchers take advantage of the huge amounts of data produced in life science, so that we can gain new insights into how living organisms work in health and disease (see ).
We have 23countries in ELIXIR, and we work together using a Hub and Nodes model:

: The ELIXIR Hub is like a headquarters and coordinates the work across ELIXIR. The Hub is based at the Wellcome Genome Campus, near Cambridge, UK.
: Each member state of ELIXIR establishes a Node. A Node is a network of organisations that work within a member state. Each Node has a lead organisation that coordinates the local ELIXIR activities e.g. the Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences (DTL) in Utrecht oversees the work of ELIXIR Netherlands, the Dutch Node.

ELIXIR Nodes








An ELIXIR Node is a collection of research institutes within a member country. ELIXIR Nodes run the resources and services that are part of ELIXIR.
Each Node has a lead institute that oversees the work of that Node.For example, ELIXIR Norway's lead institute is the University of Bergen. The other institutes in the Node arethe University of Oslo, the University of Troms, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.

If you would like to contact your local Node, choose the Node from the list below.  Each Node page has a "contact" section, so just contact your Node using the details you find there.

The Nodes build on the strengths of the scientific communities of that country.Norway, for example, has leading research centres in marine biology, so ELIXIR Norway provides services focused on marine metagenomics and fish genomics.
EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) is an intergovernmental organisation so it is the only Node that is not associated with a country.

Why ELIXIR is needed








To manage the huge increase in life science data

The rise of high throughput technologies such as sequencingas well asmany other technologies producing diverse, varied and complex datahas meant that life science is producing huge amounts of data. Most research centres do not have the facilities to store or transfer this much data, nor the expertise to analyse them.
ELIXIR's  is creating a network of supercomputer services that is making it easier for researchers to manage this data deluge. It enables researchers across Europe to use existing facilities to access, store, transfer and analyse large and complex datasets, in the cloud.
The  is establishing quality criteria for data resources, so researchers can more easily choose the best suited to their needs. The Platform also works to better link data and related literature.

To deal with the increasing complexity of data

Life science data existin a wide range of formats, and aredescribed in different ways. This makes it difficult to merge datasets and analyse the data.
ELIXIRs establishes standards that can be used to describe life science data, thereby making different datasets easier to compare and analyse together. Thehelps researchersto identify the training they need, andruns courses on dealing with large and complex datasets.

To make it easier to find the right tools and training

Biological science increasingly involves large amounts of data and it is not easy to find the right software to analyse them. If a researcher finds the right software for what they want to do, they have to learn how to use it. For this, and handling large datasets in general, they need specialist training.
ELIXIR has built a  to make it easier to find the right research tools. The  also  tools for quality to help researchers make more informed choices.
The  makes it easier more people to learn how to use these tools, as well as increasing the discoverability of a range of training resources through a covering all aspects of bioinformatics and computational biology. Through its Train the Trainer programme, it also keeps the trainers themselves up to date with current best practices as well as providing pedagogic skills to trainers.

To build a more robust bioinformatics infrastructure

Bioinformatics is a constantly evolving discipline. Some countries in Europe operate mature bioinformatics services, resources and underlying infrastructures. Other countries, though, are still developing theirs.
ELIXIR promotes an exchange of knowledge and technical support across Europe so that less maturebioinformatics services and resourcesare helped to grow and ultimately forma pan-European, integrated infrastructure. This provides significant efficiency savings to the countries that fund these infrastructures.
To support the long-term sustainability of the infrastructure, ELIXIR works with funders, policy-makers and other important stakeholders to showcase itsand , and that of Open Science more broadly, including through uses of its resources by industry.

To drive innovation and industry usage

Handling and analysing the massive amounts and complexity of data now generated in life science often takes more resources than agri-business and biotech firms have. One solution is to collaborate with public-funded organisations such as ELIXIR. To foster this, ELIXIR runs an  that promotes collaborations through networking and staff exchanges.
The ELIXIR infrastructuremakes life science data around Europe more accessible, and provides easier ways to analyse and gain new insights from these data. These new insights in turn stimulateinnovations in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in agricultural and environmental research. This results in economic growth through job creation and tax revenues, as well ashelping toaddress some of the societal challenges we face, such as an ageing population, environmental degradation and food security.

What ELIXIR is
ELIXIR is an intergovernmental organisation for life science dataand resources (read more in page and in the ).
ELIXIR is organised in a Hub and Nodes model, where the Hub acts as the coordinator of the infrastructure, which is composed of services run by the Nodes. The Hub and the Nodes carry out different functions, and therefore handle different kinds of personal data.

The  carries out administration and coordinates the ELIXIRinfrastructure.
An  is a collection of research institutes within a country that is an ELIXIR member. ELIXIR Nodes run the scientific resources and services that are part of the ELIXIR infrastructure.


Personal data
What personal data does ELIXIR deal with?
In practice the ELIXIR Hub deals with personal admin data in three different contexts (a,b,c):



Context
Personal data collected


a. ELIXIR administration
Admin data from our staff and from our governance bodies members and delegates, and from the members of operational groups of ELIXIR, which ELIXIR needs to carry out its day-to-day administration and management.


b.  funded by ELIXIR
Admin data (e.g. name, email address, home institute) from the individuals involved in the management of these projects. Read more on our .


c.  coordinated by the Hub
Admin data (e.g. name, email address, home institute) from the individuals involved in the management of EU Projects coordinated by the ELIXIR Hub. Read more on our .



What personal data does the ELIXIR Hub NOT deal with?
The ELIXIR Hub has no access to the scientific data processed by the Nodes for internal and EU-funded projects.
What personal data do the Nodes deal with?
The Nodes deal with personal admin (e.g. their own staff) and scientific data.
Some EU projects (e.g. B1MG, BY-COVID) do involve personal data like genomic sequences or genotypic and phenotypic data from individuals. Such scientific data is processed by the ELIXIR Nodes or other project beneficiaries. This means that:

In ELIXIR Nodes located within the EU, the data is protected by European data protection legislation (GDPR).
In ELIXIR Nodes located outside the EU (Israel, Switzerland, and the UK), the data is protected by an essentially equivalent level of protection as that afforded within the EU. This is recognised by the adequacy decisions granted to those countries by the European Commission.
Any genetic or health-related data collected during projects is handled by the Nodes and thus protected by the GDPR rules (for Nodes within the EU) or national data protection rules (applicable to extra EU Nodes) on sensitive data.

Is any personal data transferred within ELIXIR (e.g. Hub and Nodes)?
Yes, but only in the following instanceand only for certain types of data:

The Nodes transfer administrative data to the Hub e.g. contact details of people involved in the management of .


Please note: Scientific data, which may include sensitive data, processed in the context of internal projects and EU projects, is never transferred to the Hub.

ELIXIRs legal model
ELIXIR is a consortium consisting of 21 countries and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). As such, ELIXIR lacks its own legal personality. To overcome this, EMBL has agreed to allow ELIXIR to use its legal personality as an international organisation.
There are two main consequences of this borrowed legal personality:

1. EMBL and ELIXIR are not subject to GDPR

In the context of data protection, EMBL and ELIXIR are not subject to the EU , the data protection law applied by EU countries.With EMBLs legal personality, ELIXIR also inherits EMBLs privileges and immunities as an international organisation (IO). The unimpeded functioning of an IO and the achievements of its objectives imply that it is exempt from national data protection law, to ensure its autonomous organisational and administrative sovereignty.

2. ELIXIR applies EMBLs data protection rules

Though the GDPR does not apply, ELIXIR is still subject to data protection rules, involving high standards comparable to those of GDPR. It applies EMBLs data protection scheme, called (IP68). The IP68 is adapted to the needs of an international scientific research organisation but reflects the principles of European data protection law while remaining within the boundaries of EMBLs legal status.

You can read more about ELIXIRs legal model and its relationship with EMBL on .
See below for more about ELIXIRs legal model and data protection.

ELIXIRs data protection framework
ELIXIR applies EMBLs  as its data protection law.
Why is it called policy?
EMBL as an international organisation cannot produce laws as understood within national contexts, where the State emanates rules that are binding on all its citizens. Internal Policies however are effectively internal laws that EMBL (and ELIXIR) are obliged to follow.
The Internal Policy 68 supports the principles of GDPR in a form adapted to the intergovernmental nature of the organisation. It contains e.g. principles to follow for data processing, it lists the legal basis to rely on for lawful processing, lays out the rights of data subjects and provides for the appointment and independence of a Data Protection Officer.
Why does ELIXIR not apply GDPR?

GDPR does not apply to international organisations (recognised by the European Data Protection Board in its  of 12 November 2019, at page 23).
Principle of functional necessity: international organisations are granted certain privileges and immunities to properly fulfil their tasks entrusted to them by their Member States. The unimpeded functioning of an IO and the achievements of its objectives imply that it is exempt from the application of national and EU data protection law.
ELIXIR needs to maintain an open approach with regards to data protection standards because ELIXIR Member States are not all European or part of the EU.

Why applying Internal Policy 68 is adequate in terms of GDPR
Internal Policy 68 adapts GDPR principles to the intergovernmental nature of the organisation, as well as its need for free scientific research that crosses borders and allows for extensive collaboration.
ELIXIR follows and applies fundamental principles of the GDPR  see .

How we are funded








As a distributed infrastructure, ELIXIR has a mixed funding model with contributions coming from a number of mostly public sources:

Collectively, the ELIXIR Hub and Nodes compete for grant funding from the European Union, under Horizon 2020 and the Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI);
The ELIXIR Hub is funded through membership fees paid by Member countries, and much of this funding is then transferred back to Nodes (e.g. via ) to  deliver ELIXIRs five-year ;
ELIXIR Nodes are typically funded through national-level investments, supporting national coordination, and the development and operation of services;
ELIXIR Nodes also receive support from international funders, such as the US  (NIH);
Finally, some ELIXIR Nodes are able to access European Union Structural Funds, for instance to support national coordination and the purchasing of facilities.

Other sources of funding for Nodes include foundations (e.g. the Wellcome Trust and Wallenberg Foundation), and also the industry, though the latter is modest compared to the public funding received by Nodes.

How we work within ELIXIR
ELIXIR's work is guided by five-year Scientific Programmes. See the .
At a national level


Each country that is a member of ELIXIR has a "Node". A Node is the collection of research institutes that work for ELIXIR in that country. The Node institutes run national services and support local users. The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) is also a Node, but is an international organisation rather than a country.


At a cross-national level


Platforms bring together experts from Nodes to develop ELIXIRs technical vision and coordinate its technical activities.  

Communities bring together experts to develop ELIXIRs vision and coordinate its  activities within a particular life science domain.  

Focus Groups are informal groups that look at topics of emerging interest for ELIXIR. 
Internal projects fund the Platforms and Communities to develop resources, and encourage  collaboration across the Nodes. 

Technical and Training Coordinators provide advice and promote collaboration and the adoption of good practices. 

In addition to the above, ELIXIR has its own internal ,  and  groups (login required).
How we work with others


ELIXIR both collaborates in and coordinates EU projects. 

ELIXIR organises events and projects that bring the private and public sectors together. 

ELIXIR collaborates extensively within and beyond Europe, and works with key research infrastructures.

Data Platform








The goal of the ELIXIR Data Platform is to drive the use, re-use and value of life science data. It aims to do this by providing users with robust, long-term sustainable data resources within a coordinated, scalable and connected data ecosystem.
Bioinformaticians and life science researchers in both academic and industrial settings need confidence in the sound governance, life cycle management, and long-term sustainability of those data resources.
They also need open access to technically and scientifically excellent data resources for effective data discovery, deposition, and re-use. The ELIXIR Data platform promotes Open Access as a core principle for publicly funded research. ELIXIR resources ideally reflect this commitment and have terms of use or a licence that enables the reuse and remixing of data (see  for a list of open licenses).

Platform highlights

: European data resources that are of fundamental importance to research in the life sciences and are committed to the long-term preservation of data.
: repositories recommended for the deposition of life sciences experimental data.
: this list is updated as Nodes finalise or review their Service Delivery Plans (see ).

Goal:To supportthe establishment, and continuethe monitoring of global partnerships in the  and business cases for the long term sustainability of , , and ELIXIR Community Resources.
Activities:

Sharingthe experience gained with the European life science data infrastructure from the ELIXIR Core Data Resource selection process, as considerations of global priorities and resource allocation.
Influencingthe development of Data Management Plans to ensure best practice and adoption of ELIXIR Core Data Resources and ELIXIR Deposition Databases.
Participating in the international , working to ensure collective support for those data resources essential to the work of life science researchers, educators, and innovators worldwide.




An example of the Platform's work: community annotation of Europe PMC documents
The Data Platform has helped build a system that enables community annotations to appear in the abstracts in . These annotations can be clicked on for further information.

Before


Before: An abstract at Europe PMC without annotations. Before the annotation system was developed you could not highlight key terms or click on them to access other data resources related to that term across the web.

After


After: You can now highlight key terms, and click the terms for further information. Gene Function annotations, corresponding to s from Entrez Gene, have been mapped back to the articles by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics' text mining group, providing links to  (an ELIXIR Core Data Resource). In the abstract above, the link is to the UniProt record for PTEN, where you can find a wealth of information about the protein, its function, the gene that encodes the protein, and the pathology caused by genetic variants.

Compute Platform








The ELIXIR Compute Platform was established in 2015 to build and integrate cloud, compute, storage and access services for the life-science research community.
Today, thousands of science laboratories across the world generate massive amounts of data that they make available to collaborators directly or place in public archives for open access. In this situation, the traditional method of a researcher downloading and analysing data locally is no longer viable due to both the data size and scope of the analysis activities.
The data needs to be managed as a federation, where data providers work as a single infrastructure providing mechanisms where researchers can bring their analysis to where the data is located. The ELIXIR Compute Platform infrastructure will allow life scientists to easily access, share and analyse data from different sources across Europe.
The objective is to combine all components of the ELIXIR Compute services into a seamless workflow. A researcher may use the ELIXIR Authorisation and Authentication services to securely create a scientific software analysis environment, and use the environment to access large biological data resources stored in a cloud.

Services offered
Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI)

Provides a user access and identity management service for academia and industry.
Allows users to consolidate their different online identities (university ID, Google ID, ORCID ID) into one identity.
For accessing sensitive data, it provides REMS (Resource Entitlement Management System), an electronic tool where a researcher needs to apply for approval by the resource provider.
To start using the service, see the  or email aai-contact [at] elixir-europe.org.


What the Platform does

Develops services in three areas: authentication and authorisation, storage and data transfer, and cloud and computing resources (see below).
Gathers requirements from the ELIXIR community and passes them to existing services provided by the  and their partners, and by the European e-Infrastructures (i.e. , , , , ). This ensures the services are relevant to ELIXIR community.
Integrates Compute Platform services into the e-Infrastructure services, so the Platform services are available to the European e-Infrastructure community.
Combines ELIXIR Compute services into a seamless workflow using the ELIXIR Authorisation and Authentication Infrastructure (AAI). This enables you to access all services with just one sign-in.
Works with  to ensure the Platform's services fit the needs of specific life science domains.

3D-BioInfo Community









Structural bioinformatics provides methods and tools to analyse, predict, archive and validate the three-dimensional (3D) structure data of biomacromolecules such as proteins, RNA or DNA.
The specific 3D shapes of macromolecules allow them to perform many functions within cells. Understanding their structures is therefore crucial for understanding the interactions and functions of cells, which in turn opens up the potential for innovations in biotechnology and drug development.
The 2023 3D BioInfo Community F2F/virtual Community meeting is coming up. More information can be found  and on this .

The next3D-BioInfo Webinar will be on 7 May 2024 link
A complete list of previous webinars is available .

The recent developments in experimental methods to determine the structure of a macromolecule have led to rapid expansion of structural data, both quantitatively and qualitatively. European structural bioinformatics groups - members of the ELIXIR 3D-BioInfo Community - played a crucial role in validating these data and developed various tools for working with them. ELIXIR Nodes are responsible for the development and sustainable operation of a number of tools used by the structural biology community, including three : PDBe, CATH and InterPro.
The Communities white paper was published in April 2020, . Christine Orengo, Structural and Molecular Biology Department, UCL, UK leads the Community together with five Task leads (see below).
There are five main areas of interest for the 3D-BioInfo Community:

Activity 1: To develop the infrastructure for FAIR structural and functional annotations
There are many small data resources that derive added value annotations from the  and the . However, a lack of data standards and uniform data access mechanisms significantly reduce the impact of these specialist data resources. To address this, the Community will:

Support the development of the   a community-driven data resource for structural and functional annotations that places structural data in its biological context. PDBe-KB will increase the visibility and interoperability of niche data resources and enable comparisons between specific types of annotations obtained from different software tools.
Establish data standards for different types of annotations and integration of these annotations using a community-driven data exchange format and a uniform data access mechanism.
Develop a network of 3D-Beacons by integrating annotations from PDBe-KB with structural models from existing European and other international archives. This will lead to increased coverage of structure data in the sequence space.

This activity is coordinated by Sameer Velankar, Protein Data Bank in Europe, EMBL, UK.


Activity 2: To create open resources for sharing, integrating and benchmarking software tools for modelling the proteome in 3D
The 3D-BioInfo Community will:

Develop tools to allow the scientific community to extend the current information on protein 3D structures, interactions and assemblies and extract knowledge from it. The initial focus will be on software tools and community-wide benchmarking for modelling 3D structures and conformational flexibility of proteins and protein assemblies.
Extend the content of ELIXIR benchmarking platform, , by adding software tools for structural biology. It will also include workflows and guidelines for modelling 3D structures of proteins, protein complexes and assemblies, based on known structures available in the PDBe.
Develop tools for evaluating the quality of 3D models of proteins and protein complexes. This will improve the evaluation of the molecular modelling methods, and help developers optimize their procedures.
Develop standard quality measures and evaluation protocols for 3D structure modelling tools, building on the work by the  and  communities.
Develop a one-stop-shop of benchmark datasets for testing and evaluating methods for generating scoring, and ranking models of protein complexes. The wide research community will also be invited to contribute with their own datasets, following well-defined community-approved standards.
Develop necessary infrastructure for managing the  (automated registration and submission, tools for accessing and navigating target information, predicted models and results).
Develop a knowledge portal providing access to workflows and guidelines to various tools for modelling conformational flexibility.

This activity is coordinated by Shoshana Wodak, VIB-VUB, CSB, BE.


Activity 3: To help develop models for protein-ligand interactions
In silico technologies for modeling the interactions of proteins with drug-like compounds (ligands) can speed up the discovery of new medications and reduce the cost of the drug discovery process. To support these approaches the 3D-BioInfo Community will:

Develop benchmark datasets for assessing Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) tools on a large-scale and under well-defined FAIR conditions, complementing efforts such as the .
Quantify different properties (e.g. charge, polarity, size, flexibility of the binding site and ligand etc.) for each entry in the benchmark, to enable evaluation of SBDD tools as a function of these properties.
Develop links to other databases and standardise the retrieved data to complement the information provided for each protein-ligand complex in the benchmark sets.
Add information on the non-bioactive conformations of ligands to standardise the comparison of docking calculations starting from such geometries.
Add information on experimentally determined non-active compounds to be used as negative examples for testing virtual screening procedures.
Make all benchmark datasets, benchmark workflows, and benchmarking results publicly available via the OpenEBench platform.
Developing tutorials and other training materials for structure-based modelling and interpretation of their results.

This activity is coordinated by Vincent Zoete, Department of Oncology, SIB, CH.


Activity 4: To develop tools to Describe, Analyse, Annotate, and Predict Nucleic Acid Structures
The ultimate goal in this area is to encourage the development and use of software tools to describe, analyse, annotate, and predict nucleic acid (NA) structures. In particular the Community will:

Catalogue software tools for building nucleic acid models based on their sequences alone as well as for modelling their 3D structures using experimental data, and facilitate the integration of these tools.
Coordinate the unification of the existing NA geometry standards and formulate specifications for missing standards.
Develop benchmarks dataset for evaluating the quality of predicted or experimentally determined NA structures.
Continuously update the catalogue of software tools developed by the RNA tools and software consortium, and extend these tools to DNA structures.
Closely collaborate with the experimental structural biology communities (Instruct-ERIC and EuroBioImaging) to ensure consistency across the different research communities.

This activity is coordinated by Bohdan Schneider, Institute of Biotechnology, CAS, CZ.


Activity 5: To establish a Biostudies database of protein engineering results
Fully predictable engineering of proteins to adopt desired structures and to exhibit desired functions &/or physical properties remains a key challenge. This activity seeks to collect data on the results of different approaches to protein engineering and design, with the underlying philosophy that we can learn as much from designs that fail as we can from designs that succeed.
To achieve this goal, we will establish a Biostudies database as a focal point where researchers can deposit such data.

We will establish a resource in which commonly used tools that facilitate protein engineering are collected, alongside user feedback and comments.
We will lead activities to facilitate the cross-fertilisation of ideas in the area of protein engineering and design, with particular emphasis on the support of networking by junior scientists.

The protein engineering activity is unique in involving wet-lab scientists alongside computational biologists. Including wet-lab practitioners facilitates a deep and meaningful assessment of database content. The protein engineering activity thus productively interacts with the other 3DBio activities.
This activity is coordinated by Lynne Regan, Centre for Synthetic and Systems Biology, UoE, UK.

Biodiversity Community









Biodiversity represents the full spectrum of organisms on Earth, at population, community, and ecosystem levels. The loss and decline of biological diversity are recognised by scientists and the public as a critical challenge for humankind to address. Addressing this global crisis requires knowledge of the diversity of life on Earth, how that diversity functions and interacts, and how it responds to changing environmental pressures. This is why research that transforms our understanding of the variety of life on Earth, at phenotypic or genetic levels, is so important.
Current biodiversity data infrastructures and resources are a testament to the long-standing recognition by multiple stakeholders of their importance. However, their heterogeneity poses many challenges. These challenges are both technical, in terms of data analysis and data integration, and at the level of the scientific community, which faces a complex landscape of tools and data that can be difficult to navigate. Building connections across the many infrastructures and services active in biodiversity research is key to overcoming these challenges. These endeavours support the broader ELIXIR framework of striving to bring data science solutions to the priority area of Biodiversity, Food Security, and Pathogens.
For more information, have a look at the ,as well as the published .

Federated Human Data Community









Vision:Our vision for the ELIXIR Federated Human Data (FHD) Community is to create a federated ecosystem of interoperable services that enables population scale genomic and biomolecular data to be accessible across international borders, accelerating research, and improving the health of individuals resident across Europe. Together, the components of FHDprovide a framework for the secure submission, archival, dissemination, and analysis of sensitivehuman data across Europe, and wider.
Achieving this vision:FHD provides coordination across a number of EU, ELIXIR Node, and internationally fundedprojects that drive towards delivery ofthe shared vision. The overall objective is to provide a suite of interoperable services to deliver the vision, focussing on the interfaces that are required for the federated infrastructure rather than any single technology.


Figure 1: The shared vision of the ELIXIR Federated Human Data Community is to operate a Europe-wide network of sensitive data archives that are able to function interoperably based on common interfaces rather than any single technological solution.

Food and Nutrition Community








Misguided food choices can lead to a myriad of health complications, the most widely known being obesity, type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. To better understand the effect of food choices on health, larger amounts of more varied data are required. These data include geno- and phenotyping data from human nutritional studies, but also personal health, behavioural and socio-economic data. Using this data would enable researchers to develop products and interventions to reduce the risk of disease, and also the environmental impact of our food system.
However, food and nutrition research in Europe is still fragmented. Improved ontologies, databases, data harmonisation and ways to share the data are still needed.  Collaboration across disciplines has also become imperative, requiring a mixed network of experts, such as dieticians, nutritionists, bioinformaticians, systems biologists and consumer scientists. 

Goals of the Community
The ELIXIR Food and Nutrition Community aims to:

Standardise food and nutrition data to ensure interoperability: Create standardised questionnaires, develop ontologies to make data interoperable, develop tools to help standardise data and metadata, and offer training in FAIR data principles, data stewardship and data annotation.
Make more data available: Make data findable and accessible, including aspects such as: formatting standards, allowing for connectivity between structured datasets, encouraging rich meta-data capture, ensuring ethical data collection and access, and allowing queries and tools to find datasets.
Make data easier to reuse: Integrate food and nutrition data (with a specific focus on metabolomics and microbiomics), align analysis software with existing ELIXIR solutions (e.g. microbiomics/GALAXY and similar dataflows), interact with consumers and offer training on data reuse.
Engage with advocacy and support training: Raise awareness and encourage researchers and governmental organisations to publish (raw or processed) data, facilitate training around the FAIR principles to raise awareness within and beyond the ELIXIR Food and NutritionCommunity.
Drive tool and service availability and interoperability: facilitate access to available tools and services to analyse, visualize and manipulate F&N related data, integrate public and private repositories to allow easy data transfer for analysis and processing, including the possibility for chained data analysis. 
Network with relevant stakeholders: interact with consumers, policy makers, educators, industry, hospitals, patients and other researchers, align with the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) strategy for sustainable long term data reuse.

Galaxy Community










Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data-intensive computational research that spans beyond the life sciences. It allows researchers without programming experience to run analysis workflows on their data, share their results, and enable others to repeat the same analyses. Galaxy makes science reproducible, facilitates sharing of data and results, and removes the hassle of installing software tools from users.
ELIXIR's Galaxy Community evolved from its , which was established in 2015 to monitor and foster the use of Galaxy in ELIXIR. Today the overall goal of the Community is to foster the use and development of Galaxy, focusing on making it easier to import data into Galaxy instances, helping to develop and share Galaxy tools and workflows, and increasing the provision of Galaxy training.
Goals of the Community

To grow the European network of Galaxy communities

An increasing number of scientific sub-communities have grown up to address specific tasks using Galaxy. The collaborative portal  (W4M) and , for example, are dedicated to handling metabolomic data and feature in the work of the ELIXIR .
The Galaxy Community's goal is to foster interactions between the domain-specific Galaxy communities, to set up common analysis workflows and standards, and to provide training in these.
The Galaxy Community acts as an umbrella organisation for many regional communities in France, UK, Netherlands, Czech Republic, etc., and supports other groups in forming such groups.



To grow the global network of Galaxy communities through partnership, contribution and leadership

The Galaxy network is a globe-spanning, highly impactful digital research infrastructure, used by hundreds of thousands of researchers across all continents. This infrastructure is built and sustainably supported through the efforts of hundreds of contributors and resource providers. Mutual partnership and agreement between global Galaxy providers are necessary for the open, rapid and continuous development of Galaxy functionalities, tools, workflows and all the other content, which in turn benefit all participating providers and communities.
Therefore an important goal of the ELIXIR Galaxy Community is the growth of the global Galaxy community, through leadership, governance, content development, platform sustainability, shared resources, community fostering, and training.
This goal can be realised through close coordination and partnership with existing Galaxy provider peers including the US, Australia and South Africa; and then through broader networking and leadership globally.
Galaxy plays a crucial role in different EOSC consortia (, , ), supporting a wide variety of use cases across different disciplines; and will continue participating in different European initiatives.
The usegalaxy.* servers across Europe and the world are offering access to , workflows and national, as well as international compute resources.












To extend Galaxy training provision


ELIXIR-organised workshops are having a fundamental impact in raising the profile of the  among global bioinformatics training efforts. This is a training material repository open for everyone to use and contribute to, providing slides, tutorials and other material on using, developing and administering Galaxy. We aim to keep these materials up-to-date and expand them to cover further areas of the life sciences. See the  for an overview of the topics addressed and other analytics.
usegalaxy.* will offer Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS)  read some  from the instructors.
We will continue promoting the use of these resources, including information about where these trainings can be run, trainers, needed tools and virtual Galaxy images. This will be done in collaboration with the ,  and  Platforms.



To create a Galaxy cloud infrastructure across Europe


The growing amount of data generated in life science, and the large number of Galaxy communities, requires increasing compute and storage resources. Our aim is to facilitate access to a broad portfolio of analysis workflows for European researchers.
Some ELIXIR Nodes already offer a centralised instance of Galaxy (, , , , ). Since 2018, in collaboration with the US Galaxy Team, we are building a network of Galaxy instances worldwide (usegalaxy.*), guaranteeing a base level of compatibility and supporting all  of the Galaxy Training Network. See the  for more information.
We also want to facilitate the usage of Galaxy on top of the different ELIXIR clouds, e.g. by using  as a single entry point for users; or through technologies and services supporting the deployment of Galaxy on federated cloud infrastructures such as . ELIXIR-Italy launched the service , hosted at the ReCaS-Bari datacenter, providing cloud resources for the deployment of on-demand Galaxy instances.



To make it easier to access and transfer data

Getting data from public databases into a Galaxy instance is the first step for most analyses. However, identifying files and their URLs and uploading these files in a computational environment is not easy for users with limited technical skills.
We aim to facilitate uploading data into Galaxy instances from the  such as , , ,  and , and also from more specialised databases such as ,  and . To optimise data access and integration in Galaxy we need to standardise and automate data transfer.
We are working closely with the worldwide Galaxy community to create and maintain shared storage of common reference data for numerous genomes, to be used across Galaxy instances via the CVMFS technology. This facilitates the inclusion of new reference genomes to any Galaxy instance, immediately providing indices and annotations.



To improve tools and data integration

Currently, a data-to-tools approach is prevalent in data analysis. This involves copying a large volume of data to a computing environment for analysis. To avoid this, we propose a tools-to-data approach based on virtualization, such as ,  or .
Galaxy already supports , meaning that tools and workflows in Galaxy can run in isolated BioContainers. We aim to maintain, update and extend BioContainers integration to keep the resource relevant and up-to-date.
We also aim to improve the accessibility of tools and data, allowing users to easily combine public and private storage and compute cloud services.



To promote FAIR principles in Galaxy

The ELIXIR Galaxy Community will promote the use of Galaxy projects that enhance the ness of Galaxy. These include  (a repository of Galaxy tools and utilities) and  (an online catalogue of the tools available on various Galaxy instances).
We will promote the use of the ELIXIR Tools registry  and work with bio.tools developers to integrate ,  and the Galaxy ToolShed more tightly into the registry.
The Galaxy Community aims to work with the  to annotate Galaxy objects (histories, workflows, etc.) as standardised  to facilitate sharing.

Human Copy Number Variation Community









Most human cells divide by mitosis, where one parent cell divides to produce two daughter cells. Just before a cell divides it makes a copy of its own DNA, but this copy may not have the same gene sequence as the parent DNA. One gene, for example, may be copied twice into the new DNA, or not copied at all. This phenomenon is called Copy Number Variation (CNV). 
It is thought that these Copy Number Variations are vital for evolution, but they also play important roles in disease. Despite the fact that Copy Number Variations are the most prevalent genetic mutation type, identifying and interpreting them is still a major challenge. The ELIXIR human Copy Number Variation (hCNV) Community aim to implement processes to make the detection, annotation and interpretation of these variations easier.
Goals of the Community

To define optimal CNV detection pipelines

The Community will use reference datasets to benchmark the existing tools for detecting hCNVs. The most sensitive, specific, reliable and rapid tool for each dataset will be identified. If no system is effective enough for some conditions, the hCNV partners will develop new tools.
The Community will also optimize the selected tool pipelines to increase their performance on ELIXIR compute facilities, and develop guidelines to help end-users use these tools to detect CNVs. These guidelines will be available through the . 



To identify reference datasets for hCNV	

The Community will produce reference datasets of fully validated somatic and germline CNVs representing a wide range of samples types and experimental technologies. These reference materials will enable the Community to evaluate and compare pipelines and/or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, and can be used for quality assurance. 
The NGS technologies are rapidly evolving and therefore the reference datasets will need to be regularly updated. 



To establish and define data exchange formats

International collaborative projects require common standards to describe their results. This ensures efficient data aggregation and comparison. Although various international initiatives are currently addressing this issue, no robust and exhaustive standard CNV annotation format has emerged so far. 
To address this, the hCNV Community will establish a list of existing formats used to describe CNVs, and develop recommended formats. If a few alternative formats are frequently used, it will provide bioinformatics resources to convert data into the common data exchange format. This work will align with existing efforts, notably  Work Streams and the . 



To create a process to facilitate the identification of patients with similar genotypes and phenotypes

Because rare diseases affect fewer than 1 in 2,000 people and as most mutations are private (i.e. restricted to a single family or small group), finding similar cases at the clinical level is a challenge. Yet finding similar cases is essential for clinical diagnosis and for identifying disease-causing genes. 
The hCNV Community will recommend standard ways of describing rare disease and provide ways to map various ontologies, medical terminologies, vocabularies and nomenclatures. This will enable cross queries and the identification of similar patients.  



To develop innovative tools to detect, annotate and interpret CNV

CNVs could involve large genomic regions and encompass multiple genes. In addition, in recessive diseases CNVs can alter one allele of a specific gene, while the second one could be altered by Short Nucleotide Variations (SNV). In many situations, it is thus difficult to identify the single or multiple genes whose alteration is directly associated with the patient's phenotype. 
Here, the hCNV community will develop innovative tools to annotate CNVs, facilitate their interpretation through a combinatorial approach, and help to pinpoint key genes in regions of interest. 



To help make hCNV services and datasets FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)

Various CNV national databases, ELIXIR Core Data Resources, and ELIXIR Deposition Databases are currently being developed by ELIXIR hCNV partners. In order to allow interoperability (including discovery), the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) will be applied to those systems to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of distributed CNV databases. 
The Community will use the  and the  databases to demonstrate the benefits of using the FAIR data principles for CNV in diagnostic and research contexts.



To disseminate knowledge and train researchers

The Community will organise meetings to gather experts' point of view on its work, to gather feedback and to disseminate knowledge. It will also promote the ELIXIR hCNV community through participation in international consortia, such as GA4GH.

Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) Community









Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) are proteins containing regions that lack a stable secondary or tertiary structure. These regions are called 'Intrinsically Disordered Regions' (IDRs) and play a central role in cell regulation. They are also thought to be involved many human diseases, including cancer, Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease.
IDPs are estimated to contain up to one hundred thousand interaction interfaces and a million sites of post-translational modification. However, to date, only a small fraction of IDPs have been characterised.
The major goal of the IDP Community is to support the development of standards, tools and resources to accelerate the identification, analysis and functional characterisation of IDPs. Given their therapeutic relevance, IDR-mediated interactions are now seen as potential drug targets. A better understanding of their structure and function will help in developing new strategies to treat human diseases.
Goals of the Community
The ELIXIR Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Community was created in 2019. Its goals are:

To simplify IDP data access and dissemination

The IDP field has not yet established official standards to allow consistent storage and dissemination of data.
A key responsibility of the IDP Community is to define exchange formats, guidelines and standards to improve the reproducibility, interpretation, and dissemination of experimental IDP data.
This goal has received ELIXIR support through the implementation study: .



To drive the curation of IDP literature

The vast majority of experimental data describing IDPs, the functional modules encoding their function, the regulatory mechanisms conditionally controlling that function, and their dysregulation in disease, is isolated in the text of research and review articles and in poorly formatted supplementary tables.
This hampers the integration of IDP information with data such as protein function, modification, splice variants and disease-causing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Consequently, data created at great expense is significantly underutilised.
The IDP community will support community-driven and automated curation of IDP literature.



To develop a centralised knowledgebase for IDP data

The computational IDP community in Europe develops many of the tools and resources that underlie the global IDP e-infrastructure. However, these assets are currently spread over numerous institutes and universities across Europe.
The IDP community will oversee the development of an umbrella resource, , consolidating the European IDP community resources and tools through a single standards-compliant portal to improve the accessibility of these resources for the wider biological community.



To integrate IDP data into ELIXIR Core Data Resources

IDP annotations are significantly underrepresented in the .
The IDP ELIXIR community will facilitate the integration of IDP data and services into these resources both directly and through the DisProtCentral resource.



To improve tools for IDP analysis

The IDP community would benefit from improved standardisation, benchmarking and indexing of computational tools.
Key tasks include the development of guidelines and resources for scientific (I/O) file formats, data analysis pipelines and benchmarking of scientific tools.
These developments will raise the quality of software developed by the community to produce more accurate, faster, more stable and user-friendly software implementation.

Metabolomics Community









Metabolomics is the study of small molecule metabolites in the metabolome, which is the complete set of metabolites in a biological sample. By studying these metabolites, we can observe changes in cellular networks and biochemical pathways. This could allow us to detect disease states and their progression, monitor responses to therapy, stratify patients based on biochemical profiles, and highlight targets for drug design.
A major bottleneck for this rapidly-expanding field, however, is metabolite identification. Without a comprehensive data set of metabolites to compare against, the results of metabolomics experiments are often hard to interpret.
The goal of the ELIXIR Metabolomics Community is to work with experimental scientists and developers to provide the resources, analysis tools and infrastructure that will help metabolite identification. The community will also establish an infrastructure of services, standards and datasets to help researchers discover, annotate and analyse metabolomics data from around Europe.
Goals of the Community
The ELIXIR Metabolomics Community was created in 2018. Its goals are:

To create and extend metabolomics datasets

Metabolite identification is one of the key problems facing metabolomics researchers. Identification requires high quality curated datasets, and here the reference layer of the  database is crucial. The MetaboLights database holds information about individual metabolites, their chemistry, their spectral data (MS, NMR), as well as their role in pathways and biological systems.
The compound information in MetaboLights isinitially curated in , the dictionary of small chemical compounds.
The ELIXIR Metabolomics Community aims to submit missing compound data from metabolomes into ChEBI and therefore enableMetaboLights to connect this data to metabolomes and be more comprehensive. This curated data (spectra, compounds, networks) will also be valuable as input for other reference repositories and e-infrastructures (e.g. , ).
The Community aims to use this information to create a FAIR data set for identified metabolites comprising various types of mass spectral data with the relevant metadata, and the associated quality of the identification.. This data set will be closely linked to MetaboLights.



To develop data analysis workflows for metabolomics

The Community will work with workflow management e-infrastructures such as , , and  to develop the user-friendly, modular, and reproducible data analysis needed by the experimental community.
The Community will develop comprehensive workflows for preprocessing, statistical analysis and annotation of data from LC-MS, direct infusion MS (DIMS), GC-MS, and NMR technologies. These will be run, saved, shared, and publicly referenced with digital object identifiers and included in the ELIXIR .



To promotedata standards and interoperability in metabolomics

Promote .
Develop the  as a basis for metadata standards.
Agree on persistent identifiers for metabolites, using tools like .



To support computing with large-scale metabolomics data

The  e-infrastructure enables researchers to deploy and test metabolomics workflows in public clouds (Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform) or in-house OpenStack environments in cases where sensitive data cannot leave the institution.
The ELIXIR Metabolomics Community will build on the PhenoMeNal compute infrastructure to provide further workflows for metabolomics that include the identification of metabolites in metabolomics experiments and the mapping onto biological pathways with neighbouring omics areas.



To increase the metabolomics training available

There is only one course dedicated to metabolite identification in Europe (at the Birmingham Metabolomics Training Centre). The ELIXIR metabolomics community aims to expand the delivery of metabolomics courses, for example through the .
It will create training partnerships with instrument vendors to increase the quality of training material and facilities.

Microbial Biotechnology Community









Bioeconomies are economies based on renewable resources from the land and sea, such as crops, fish, forests and animals. The bioeconomy in the EU is worth an estimated 2 trillion and employs 9% of the workforce. Microbial biotechnology designs and builds new strains of microbes that can produce chemical building blocks, food supplements, novel medicines and fuels to replace fossil fuels. As such, biotechnology can play a huge role in the bioeconomy and can help tackle climate change, achieve a clean environment, foster industrial innovation, and ensure food security.
However, a formal framework for microbial biotechnology to manage and manipulate strains, samples, knowledge, data and metadata is still lacking. The Design - Build - Test - Learn (DBTL) cycle provides a conceptual framework for the development of tailor-made microbes and biological systems. The ELIXIR Microbial Community takes the DBTL cycle as a starting point for defining its four key objectives.
Goals of the Community

To build scalable microbial Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GSMMs)

The Microbial Biotechnology Community will support the use of advanced Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GSMMs) to predict the effects of genetic manipulations on cellular phenotypes such as production of a specific compound or protein.
The Community will integrate advanced GSMMs computational models in the DBTL cycle by developing a consolidated cell model or metabolic reaction network resource that will (1) provide species-specific genome-scale metabolic networks and models, and (2) the necessary data to facilitate the design of microbial engineering projects.
The specific actions include:
			
Improve representation of microbial reference enzymes and metabolic reactions in ELIXIR databases and services
Expand descriptions of enzymatic activities to include a definition of the chemical transformations involved
Develop an open-source community-supported evaluation suite for metabolic models testing
Develop tools for microbial community description, modelling and design
Develop user interfaces for visual manipulation of advanced genome-scale models and designs methods
Define a catalogue of natural and synthetic bio-bricks
Develop a semantic framework for integration of heterogeneous models, data and algorithms





To develop a knowledge-based infrastructure for biotechnology

The Community will develop a FAIR repository of experimental data in microbial biotechnology to (1) facilitate the development of biotechnology experimental implementations and (2) encourage the reporting of experimental data.
As most applications in microbial biotechnology first design microbial strains that are then engineered and characterised, such a repository will support design of new microbial strains and contribute to the annotation of genome-scale metabolic networks.
To promote reproducibility and reuse of these experimental data, the repository will capture complete design information and complete metadata for the different Build-Test-Learn stages.
The specific actions include:
			
Compile and maintain a list of data repositories and tools available to the Microbial Biotechnology Community and register them in ELIXIR registries (FAIRsharing, bio.tools).
Establish workflows between a limited number of interoperable tools and resources to support metadata integration across the different steps in the DBTL cycle.
Identify a set of tools and conventions for metadata collection against control- and data-driven workflows for the different steps in the DBTL cycle.
Align the Community practices in workflows, data and metadata management with the current ELIXIR activities in ELIXIR ,  and  Platforms by supporting the use of Common Workflow Language, BioContainers, identifiers.org or Ontology Lookup Service.
Adopt  and  for long-term public pooling of final models, data and workflows.
Build a new data repository for reaction rules that will gather both positive and negative results.





To develop a unified semantic ontology for microbial biotechnology

To increase the tools interoperability, support dataset integration within and across the DBTL cycle(s), and increase the potential of data-mining approaches, the Community will develop shared semantic standards for the representation of data and knowledge in microbial biotechnology.
By implementing RDF data models, the Community will demonstrate how existing ELIXIR Node resources can be integrated to provide a unified access to data to end-users.
The specific actions include:
			
Map between languages that describe the designs, build processes, models, entities and experimental data in the DBTL cycle and promote their convergence where possible. Register these standards in .
Import Genome-scale metabolic networks and biochemical pathways from major resources into a common semantic namespace of chemical compounds, reactions, cellular compartments and proteins.
Support the provenance annotation of models, designs, build information and experimental data.





To develop training and community engagement in microbial biotechnology

To address the lack of a European catalogue of available training materials in microbial biotechnology and to support European coordination in training activities relevant to microbial biotechnology, the Community will collaborate with the  and  in facilitating access to high-quality training and public engagement.
The specific actions include:
			
Compile a catalogue of online courses related to Microbial Biotechnology; provide link to these in the ELIXIR Training portal (TeSS).
Organise developer hackathons to support the technical activities defined in the technical goals of the Community (see above).
Organise end-user competitions on a series of pathway and strain designs, or metabolite identification in microbial strains.
Organise public outreach events as part of existing networks and projects in microbial biotechnology.

Plant Sciences Community









The need to cope with population growth and climate change adaptation is a major challenge. We can help address this challenge by filling the gaps in managing the research data life cycle, and help plant scientists integrate data to extract biological knowledge. 
The Plant Sciences Community is an interdisciplinary group of researchers with diverse backgrounds from computer science to different fields of plant biology. We answer the needs of both bioinformaticians and plant biologists.
The Community objective is to develop an infrastructure supporting the integration and linking of different plant data types. These data types range from phenomics and genomics to transcriptomics, metabolomics, modelling and bibliographic data. 
The underlying scientific use cases encompass genetics and genomics approaches in plant sciences, with an extension of the scope towards system biology. The Community aims at promoting tools, databases, standards and best practices for plant research.
The Plant Community has also published a .

2020 AGM Report
The Community has met during the 2020 ELIXIRAll Hands. The report of the discussions is publicly available and gives an overview of the most up to date activities and objectives of the Community.
 


Collaboration with EMPHASIS
The Community has published a report with  to clarify the strategies and roles of ELIXIR and EMPHASIS in managing plant phenotyping data across Europe, and to identify opportunities for working together. The report was based on a workshop held on 15 May 2018.
 

Goals of the Community
The goals of the Community are grouped into eight tasks.

The data life cycle showing the Community tasks (in the blue circle and centre) and the use cases
that support them (around the outer edge).

1. Data standards development and dissemination
The Community aims to:

Support and encourage the integration of global standards, formats, guidelines and ontologies (e.g. MIAPPE, MCPD, BrAPI, plant trait ontologies) into repositories, tools (analysis, interoperability/conversion) and interfaces (search and visualisation). 
Extend existing work by developing or improving guidelines and standards for other data types (genomic, genotyping, *omics), as listed in FAIRsharing. 



2. Data collection
The Community aims to:

Improve and leverage ELIXIR Recommended Interoperability Resources tools such as the ISA Tools and ELIXIR deposition databases, to ensure reliable data and metadata acquisition for all data types and platforms. 
Leverage independent, platform-specific workflows, providing metadata formatting and validation tools, e.g. Fairdom. PHIS, Pippa, PhenoLIMS, linked to exact provenance information (raw data acquisition and processing).



3. Data Finding 
The Community aims to:

Ensure the visibility and reuse of data and to ease its connection to analysis environments. 
Improve plant related, highly distributed repository Findability through the development of simple and light data federation along the models of  and . 
Expand connections with other data sources, e.g. via the ELIXIR service , currently connected to BrAPI datasources, including genotyping data such as EBI databases. 



4. Data integration
The Community aims to:

Acquire knowledge from data analysis and interpretation across datasets from different domains. 
Setting up best practices and develop resources (e.g. Recommended Interoperability Resources) for the deep integration of meta/data with literature and knowledge.
Develop of a PanGenome graph. This is especially important in polyploid crops, and supports successful data integration.  is foreseen to be used for this task.



5. Data storage
The Community aims to:

Facilitate the adoption of FAIR-enabling standards and guidelines for cross-domain repositories (in support of available ).
Work on a policy that increases sustainability and FAIRness of its community repositories (e.g. through labels like Core Trust Seal or re3data, catalog of community repositories in FAIRsharing or the data platform, ...).



6. Data publication and sharing
The Community aims to:

Enable citability, following the principal, that each dataset in the public, open science domain needs to be assigned with a global unique identifier (e.g. DOI) for referencing in wider open science archives (DataCite etc) and to facilitate its further dissemination through data publications (GigaScience, ScientificData) and scientific publications. 
Standardise IDs to ensure unique IDs. Carried out on the level of dataset elements such as biological material (e.g. MCPD/MIAPPE), data acquisition technologies (e.g. genotyping or phenotyping facilities), as well as traits will be considered.



7. Tools and workflows
The Community aims to:

Standardise and annotate data with reproducible . This relies on the existence of a comprehensive tool registry (e.g. biotools.org) and its connection to workflows set up by the ELIXIR Compute Platform and the Galaxy Community. 
Promote existing workflows and best practices (existing tools compatibility, interoperability and standards input/output).



8. Processing and analysing
The Community aims to:

Ensure access to detailed data provenance, when desirable.
Facilitate (data) analysis steps facilitated through connections between data repositories and analysis environments (similarly to existing examples: BrAPI to R connections, various Galaxy workflows).

Proteomics Community









Proteomics is the large-scale experimental study of the proteome, which is all the proteins that are produced or modified by an organism or system. Proteomics can tell us about when and where proteins are expressed, the rates of protein production and degradation, characterisation of protein post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation), elucidating protein structures, and protein-protein interactions.
This information can be combined with data from other omics disciplines (genomics, metagenomics, metabolomics) to give us greater insights into how organisms work.
The goal of the ELIXIR Proteomics Community is to develop and maintain sustainable proteomics tools and data resources. An essential part of the development will also be the FAIRification of the resources (i.e.making the resources  - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).
Goals of the Community
The ELIXIR Proteomics Community was created in September 2017 and its goals are:

To improve how proteoform data is collected and integrated with other omics data

Proteoforms are the different molecular forms that a protein produced by a single gene can take. Different proteoforms can have different biological functions or can be disease biomarkers.
Current proteomics data analysis does not provide sufficient depth and accuracy to distinguish between proteoforms, so the proteomics community aims to create resources for handling, analysing and validating proteoforms. This will include creating data standards for proteoform description and detection.
The Community will also make multi-omics data sets available  and findable  for a larger community. This will make it easier to integrate proteomics data with other omics data, and enable greater insights into the relationships between proteoforms, genes, metabolites and other meta-scale entities.
The Community is conducting an Implementation Study called , which runs until June 2018.



To develop data processing and analysis pipelines in proteomics

The Community aims to develop open, scalable, user-friendly and quality controlled data analysis pipelines. These could be used in different compatible software environments, including cloud infrastructures.
Users should have access to the tools of their choice for the main experimental approaches in the field, such as data-dependent acquisition (DDA), data-independent acquisition (DIA), and targeted approaches like Selected Reaction Monitoring.



To help standardise data management and annotation in proteomics

The Community aims to develop guidelines and tools for the improvement of proteomics data set annotation, as well as extend data repositories such as PRIDE (an ELIXIR core data resource) to facilitate public data reuse.
It also aims to develop and implement guidelines and software for managing identifiable human (clinical) data from proteomics analyses.

Research Data Management Community









Research Data Management (RDM) is central to the implementation of the FAIR (Findable Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and Open Science principles. Recognising the importance of RDM, ELIXIR Platforms and Nodes have invested in RDM and launched various projects and initiatives to ensure good data management practices for scientific excellence. These projects have resulted in a rich set of tools and resources for FAIR data management.
However, these resources remain scattered across projects and ELIXIR structures, making their dissemination and application challenging. Therefore, it is important to coordinate these efforts for sustainable and harmonised RDM practices, with dedicated forums for RDM professionals to exchange knowledge and share resources.
Goals of the Community
The ELIXIR RDM Community will bring together RDM experts to develop ELIXIRs vision and coordinate its activities in order to take advantage of the available RDM assets. It aims to coordinate RDM best practices and provide an overview of how to use the existing ELIXIR RDM services, in close collaboration with ELIXIR Platforms, Communities and Focus Groups.
The expected members of the Community are life science RDM professionals in academia and industry in ELIXIR and beyond.
The scope of the Community is:

The network of RDM professionals across all Nodes (and beyond);
The management of RDM knowledge and know-how in the form of the content of the ELIXIR RDM ecosystem;
The management of the RDM training resources and expertise;
Coordination of the interactions with external international stakeholders in the area of RDM.


The initial objectives of the RDM Community focus on sustaining and consolidating the outputs of previous initiatives and projects into a unified structure. This falls into four main areas:

People network

Provide a forum that enables regular inter-personal knowledge exchange between life science RDM professionals.
Facilitate ELIXIR Node capacity building in deploying RDM services, e.g. by establishing a knowledge handbook for RDM service providers, and developing an RDM services maturity model for ELIXIR Nodes.



RDM knowledge

Coordinate and contribute to the RDM ecosystem content by collaborating with the editorial boards of RDMkit and FAIR Cookbook, to ensure that the content is continuously fit for purpose.
Collect requirements that would facilitate flow of FAIR data from researchers to repositories (such as the ELIXIR Deposition Databases) via RDM services, in order to improve the FAIRness of research data made available for life science and society at large.



RDM training

Provide a forum that enables knowledge, and teaching of best practices exchanges among RDM trainers.
Ensure that RDM training materials are being developed and FAIRified, enabling reuse and adoption by the ELIXIR Nodes.
Develop RDM learning paths for researchers, data stewards, tool developers and trainers.



External stakeholders

Create and maintain an overview of external stakeholder engagements with RDM aspects across ELIXIR Platforms, Communities, Focus Groups and projects.

Single-Cell Omics Community









Single-cell and spatial omics (SCO) has revolutionised the way and the level of resolution by which life science research is conducted. It hasnot only impactedour understanding of fundamental cell biology, but has also provided novel solutions in cutting-edge medical research.
The rapid development of single-cell and spatial technologies has been accompanied by the active development of data analysis methods, resulting in a plethora of new analysis tools and strategies every year. Such a rapid development of SCO methods and tools poses several challenges in standardisation, benchmarking, computational resources and training.
These challenges are in line with the activities of ELIXIR. The ELIXIR Single-Cell Omics Community aims to identify the main challenges in single-cell and spatial omics research and coordinate an international effort to best serve the needs of researchers. The Community will build on top of national experiences, and pave the way towards integrated long-term solutions for SCO research.
The SCO is rapidly expanding in terms of methods, data and tools. (a) Current count of articles using SCO technologies and cumulative number of cells sequenced and deposited in public databases. (b) Number of tools developed specifically to work with SCO. (c) Most common SCO molecular profiling technologies mentioned in publications. (d) Top 15 most targeted categories for software development in SCO. (e) Number of tools developed for SCO, split by which scripting languages are used. Data were taken from the  and the , and surveyed up until January 2022. Figure from .

Goals of the Community
The SCO Community has outlined key focus areas in their . In the initial phase the Community aims to address issues in:

Training
This is the core goal of the Community. 
We will connect existing materials to compile a comprehensive collection of training materials, datasets and guidelines on how to teach for trainers and learners. 
 We will adopt both top down and bottom up approaches via:
Trainer the Trainer (TtT) workshops for exchanging ideas about best practices, methods and datasets, and
offering advance training courses and compiling video catalogue of training material to enable self-study and asynchronous learning for researchers. 
In the long term we aim to utilise  to establish a well-curated ELIXIR SCO training portal, listing national and international bodies, web resources and upcoming training events.



Standardisation and interoperability
Several standards exist in the field of Single-Cell Omics (e.g. FASTQ, FAST5, BAM, CRAM), while a few processed data formats are starting to converge (e.g. tab-separated files, AnnData, HDF5, loom, SingleCellExperiment, Seurat, scverse). However, many of these have had to change in order to adapt to new technological advances that rendered previous formats inadequate.
We will focus on best practices for FAIRification in the SCO Community, building upon establishing and promoting data and metadata standards. This will be strongly coordinated with the . 
To effectively address shortfalls in current data/metadata standard paradigms, we will work towards monitoring emerging technologies and bodies and communicate these guidelines to them. We will also help incorporate new experimental concepts into these existing guidelines. Particular focus will be on spatial gene expression, as this is already showing signs of widespread adoption.



Identifying the most appropriate and performant analysis tools
A plethora of SCO tools exist, and yet standards on how to benchmark or evaluate the accuracy of each tool are lacking. Furthermore, most benchmark efforts are focused on certain cell types or tissues. 
The first goal is the identification of a few scRNA-seq datasets for developing the rules to be used for defining datasets suitable to become benchmarking cases. We aim to create a central pipeline to benchmark SCO tools and define standard datasets for such benchmarks. The outcomes of benchmarking and software challenges allow data scientists to make an informed decision on the software to be used in their analytical workflows.
 To facilitate findability and usability, we aim to contribute to tool registries and provide portable software environments of the most commonly used tools/workflows. 
In the long term, we aim to provide cloud deployable analysis pipelines that utilise  and  platforms, as well as providing curated datasets for user driven benchmark on the  infrastructure.

Systems Biology Community








Introduction to the Community

Systems biology aims to understand how biological functions emerge from interactions between the multiple components of living systems by modelling the (dynamics of) interactions and processes. It studies what makes the whole different from the sum of its parts. A key feature of systems biology is often the integration of data, which is often in large volumes and heterogeneous, at multiple scales, both in space and in time.


The systems biology cycle

The overarching long-term goal of the ELIXIR Systems Biology Community is to make systems biology modelling a central pillar of research in biology. In this vision, systems biological models are developed based on the understanding of the biological problem, are used to design biological experiments, and help with the interpretation of collected data. The combined results then allow the development of actionable solutions to the original biological problem.
In the context of ELIXIR, the Systems Biology Community has two main aims:

To bring models to the centre of ELIXIRs effort to integrate and interpret ;
To further and facilitate the use of ELIXIRs data, tools, interoperability, compute and training resources by Community participants and members of the wider European and global systems biology community.

The systems biology community in Europe and globally is already well-organised, although it has lacked a systematic link to ELIXIR. Members of the Systems Biology Community are active participants in established projects and networks such as , , , ,  and . The Community encompasses many former participants in the .
Goals of the Community
As set out in its white paper, the Community has identified a set of short (3-year), medium (6-year) and long-term (10-year) goals that address its seven Grand Challenges. These are grouped under four main themes which will be reflected in the Communitys first Implementation Study:

Strengthening standardisation and interoperability
The standardisation needs in systems biology remain diverse. Data and models, including their metadata, need consistent structuring following standardised formats.
Close collaboration of ELIXIR with standardisation communities dedicated to modelling in the life sciences, such as COMBINE, as well as with relevant committees of standardisation bodies like CEN/CENELEC and ISO, will ensure further development and adaptation of existing modelling standards to the needs of models shared via ELIXIR resources.


Developing and deploying data and modelling technologies
Although the intertwining between modelling and experimentation is a hallmark of systems biology, its practical implementation remains challenging. Partly this is due to culture and insufficient training, but it also stems from difficulties in generating adequate, quantitative dynamic data that can support modelling and from the lack of models that are sufficiently accurate to handle the generated data.
Addressing these challenges will require:

an interface between big data and modelling frameworks;
integration of modelling approaches, including temporal and spatial modelling;
application of the modelling results in a wide range of relevant domains, from bioengineering at various scales to precision and personalised medicine.



Building capacity and providing training
Although the separate curricula in physical sciences, data-focused life sciences and computer science have become quite effective in training in their own disciplines, they are inadequate to train multidisciplinary teams which need to tackle increasingly complex problems.
Systems biologists often have to cope with scattered knowledge resources. Hence, a well-balanced and consistent set of competences are required that are compatible across the ELIXIR Nodes.
We propose to implement a programme of organisational capacity building, including specific training in gap areas, advanced training, knowledge sharing and staff exchanges to build a well-developed and interconnected Systems Biology Community.
We will make use of the ELIXIRs training portal  by integrating different tools and services relevant to systems biology and making them available to all Nodes.


Fostering industrial and societal embedding
Systems-level understanding and analysis of huge amounts of experimental data is required for different industries such as hospitals, pharmaceutical industry, biotechnological companies, health care institutions, regulatory agencies, and government. However, the potential significance of systems approaches in these different sectors has not been exploited fully.
The ELIXIR Systems Biology Community will take an active role in the use of ELIXIR resources and in the definition of activities aiming to develop new industrial collaborations and to strengthen existing ones. These activities will be aligned to ELIXIRs  by:

facilitating collaborations between researchers in academia and industry;
allowing the use of ELIXIR resources by industry;
engaging effectively and appropriately with the private sector.

Toxicology has been an active research field for many decades, with academic, industrial and government involvement. Modern omics and computational approaches are changing the field, from merely disease-specific observational models into target-specific predictive models. 
Traditionally, toxicology has strong links with other fields such as biology, chemistry, pharmacology and medicine. With the rise of synthetic and new engineered materials, alongside ongoing prioritisation needs in chemical risk assessment for existing chemicals, early predictive evaluations are becoming of utmost importance to both scientific and regulatory purposes.

The current main goal of the Toxicology Community is to support the integration of standards, tools and resources to support toxicology research projects and risk governance at the national and international level.

Goals of the Community
The ELIXIR Toxicology Community was created in 2020. Its goals are:

Align open solutions from toxicology research with ELIXIR services and resources
Both toxicology projects and ELIXIR  and  have developed models, ontologies, educational material and standards.
The Toxicology Community will align efforts and maximise the benefit. For example, various toxicology projects have been using  annotation in online training material.


Connect toxicology research with ELIXIR Platforms and Communities
More synergy can be found by more closely connecting the core ELIXIR resources and communities with the inclusive communities that have evolved over the past few years like OpenTox, eNanoMapper, diXa, OpenRiskNet, NORMAN and older communities like the Federation of European Toxicologists & European Societies of Toxicology (EUROTOX), the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) and European Environmental Mutagenesis and Genomics Society (EEMGS, formerly known as EEMS).


Develop open community standards
Toxicology projects like OpenTox, diXa, eNanoMapper, and others have already developed various open, domain-specific standards. Some in collaboration with ELIXIR projects like , , etc.
 This goal aims to further develop open community standards to support common interest, including ontologies, APIs, data formats, deposition databases, and publication recommendations.

Focus Groups








ELIXIR Focus Groups are agile structures that bring interested parties together around a particular topic. Typically they are used to address emerging areas of interest and seek to identify a strategy that ELIXIR can follow.
Establishing a Focus Group may lead to a new ELIXIR Community, but that is not the default intention. In most cases that will not happen. In addition, it will not be a requirement for a proposed new Community to have previously been a Focus Group.
Focus Groups are open to any member of ELIXIR plus, where useful, external parties. They are established by a lightweight approval process, at the discretion of the ELIXIR Director.
You can find the rationale, a more detailed description, and the application formto create a Focus Group in .

Biocuration Focus Group








About the Biocuration Focus Group
The process of biocuration, performed by expert biologists, is the life-blood of knowledgebases. The work of biocurators involves identifying and reading the full text of key papers, then extracting relevant information with supporting evidence.
A growing corpus of open-access full-text articles provides new opportunities to enhance article triage and browsing systems; at the same time, many text mining workflows are sufficiently mature to support curation activities.
ELIXIR has structures in place to support organisations and developers providing biological data and data-centric tools at scale and has been very successful in this endeavour. Historically, these services have been led by major bioinformatics services. In the , there is an increased focus on communities of researchers and the nurturing of smaller-scale grass-roots sources of curated data to support specialist or emerging ares of interest.
The Biocuration Focus Group is establised to provide the supporting mechanism driving this scientific theme in the 2019-2023 Scientific Programme, and widen the applicability of ELIXIR activities to data resource developers/operators across  and their constituent institutions.
Goals
This Focus Group will act as a connection point for all of the ELIXIR members and their close collaborators who have biocuration as their main area of responsibility, as an important part of their research activities, or as an application area for tools they are developing. It will:

Connect ELIXIR biocuration experts and users to  (ISB) and coordinate ELIXIR activites with the goals and event of the ISB.
Connect biocurators to the activities of the ELIXIR, including the  and the , and act as a user group to shape requirements and evaluate relevant technologies.
Track the Data Manager Expert Network being developed under ELIXIR-CONVERGE and contribute advice on the relation of individual biocurators to ELIXIR under the current models and in future programme.

Deliverables
Outputs are likely to include:

ELIXIR contributions to ISB events and strategy.
Gap analysis, technical requirements and end user reviews of resources for biocurators.
Recommendations on how ELIXIR can support the careers and recognition of researchers with biocuration as part of their role.
Contribution to future ELIXIR strategy and possible roles for individual biocurators and the biocuration community.

Cancer Data  Focus Group









In the field of cancer there are many challenges e.g.

tumour heterogeneity;
investigation of new enzymes;
the fight against contamination;
tumour evolution;
cancer progression;
harmonization of data from electronic health records.

To address the needs of this complex landscape cancer data has been identified as one of the Use Cases of the EU Member State driven . Additionally, cancer data has been identified by Horizon Europe as one of five Mission Areas.
The objective of this Focus Group is to discuss the common bioinformatic needs that Use Cases of working within the cancer field pose to the ELIXIR Nodes; to afford the opportunity to proactively identify the topics at the intersection of ELIXIRs priorities and this European research area. This will enable ELIXIR to dynamically map the gathered information towards these topics where possible.
Goals of the group
A core activity in scope for this Focus Group is to present Gold Standard examples from ELIXIR Nodes (e.g. research institutes, hospitals and clinics) in working with cancer related data in order to highlight the opportunities arising from data, tools and platform interoperability, and to promote the added value from unobstructed data sharing of cancer data for biomedical research and applications.
A planned outcome is the publication of a positioning paper on recommendations from ELIXIR on cancer data related best practices, and where the bioinformatic infrastructure gaps are across Europe in working with cancer data.

Environmental Impact Focus Group








This Focus Group will explore ways to assess and minimise the environmental impact of ELIXIR, and of data handling in general. We will raise awareness about the issues and solutions. We will also explore how ELIXIR can help interdisciplinary research on the environmental impact on human health and biodiversity.
1. Environmental impact of scientific computing
We aim to:

Raise awareness
Collect and summarise information for our community
Make service users aware of their environmental impact, e.g. expose the impact of an analysis in Galaxy
Explore methods for the environmental impact assessment of scientific computing (e.g. hardware architectures, optimised hardware utilisation; energy consumption (in KWh electricity used to complete computations as part of the research work), energy sources, network usage (since transferring data comes at a cost), location)
Minimise rework by reusing as much as possible existing "building blocks" which have already been developed and validated (instead of systematically "reinventing the wheel")
Suggest actions to mitigate the impact

2. Environmental impact of ELIXIR
We aim to:

Offer concrete recommendations on how to lower the environmental impact of ELIXIR as a community, network of people and institutions, and as an organisation
Link ELIXIR Platforms with the Green IT movement

3. Environmental impact on human health and nature
We aim to:

Bring together scientific communities e.g.:
		
Climate science
Biodiversity (, )

Health data with geolocation (, )

Human exposome (), chemical exposures ()


Promote efforts that will help interdisciplinary research on planetary health

This group will initially work through this and a channel on theELIXIR

FAIR Training Focus Group














This Focus Group aims to implement FAIR principles in training (: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). The groups contains members from ELIXIR and from the international community.
Goals of the group
Goal 1: Train scientists on how to implement FAIR principles
The outcome of this effort is a catalog of courses, course materials, and curricula on the FAIR principles. This also connects to relevant efforts under , such as the Data Management and Data Stewardship curriculum development. An additional connection is also on the Terms4Skills initiative, capturing the competencies necessary for training on the FAIR principles.
Links




Goal 2: FAIRify training materials and courses
We are developing guidelines for how training resources can be made FAIR, including training material on how to make training material FAIR. We are supporting the broader bioinformatics community to adopt these guidelines.
The guidelines also facilitate the creation of a checklist that can help streamline their adoption by trainers and communities alike. Ultimately this improves the FAIRness of existing resources and makes training more findable in , ELIXIR's registry of training courses and materials.
Outcomes of the group

Publications: a notable outcome of this WG is the recently published .

Learning Paths Focus Group








Learning Paths (LPs) are pathways that guide learners through a set of learning courses or materials to be undertaken progressively to acquire the desired knowledge and skills on a subject of interest.
The primary objective of this Focus Group is to foster the exchange of knowledge, ideas, and experiences with the aim of identifying needs, devising solutions, and advocating the widespread adoption of learning paths across ELIXIR, its Nodes, Communities, and beyond. This effort will address the current lack of guidance in developing curricula or structured training programs, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the learning experience for end users.
Goals of the group

Enhancing educational strategies for the development of structured learning programmes.
Advocating and disseminating learning path guidelines to support their development in ELIXIR.

Machine Learning Focus Group









Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a discipline that enables computers to assist humans in making sense of large and complex data sets.
With the drop in the cost of high-throughput technologies, large amounts of omics data are being generated and made accessible to researchers. Analyzing these complex high-volume data is not trivial, and the use of classical statistics can not explore their full potential.
Machine Learning can thus be very useful in mining large omics datasets to uncover new insights that can consequently lead to the advancement of Life Sciences.
The ELIXIR Machine Learning Focus Group was initiated in October 2019, in order to capture the emerging need in Machine Learning expertise across the network.
Goals of the group


Standards for Machine Learning
This includes aspects such as controlled terminology/ontology and services for ML model description and sharing, alignment to the ELIXIR  and  Platforms, as well as defining best practices for Machine Learning-related reviewing.


Machine Learning and reproducibility
This area focuses on the definition of the best practices for developing, sharing and reusing Machine Learning approaches (including, but not limited to, Machine Learning models, algorithms, frameworks and protocols including the DOME recommendations ), while at the same time involving the existing approaches in the .


Benchmarking of Machine Learning tools
In order to facilitate clear and objective comparison of ML-based tools, it is important to establish a benchmarking protocol; this may include datasets, protocols and services offered by the ELIXIR Tools Platform.


Training for Machine Learning
Machine Learning has been identified by the ELIXIR Training Platform gap analysis task as an existing need. As such, a particular area of focus for this group will be to design and produce training resources for supporting the ELIXIR community, based on the standards and approaches established by the .


Integration across ELIXIR Communities
Machine Learning is a key competency that is relevant to a large number of activities, as well as being clearly aligned to several funding opportunities. As such, a persistent activity of this group is to align and coordinate these efforts across all relevant ELIXIR groups, such as the  and the .


Outputs of the Focus Group
The ML Focus group has recently published the DOME recommendations in . DOME is a set of community-wide recommendations for reporting supervised machine learningbased analyses applied to biological studies. Broad adoption of these recommendations will help improve machine learning assessment and reproducibility.
Going beyond a standard, the DOME recommendations can facilitate reproducibility in Machine Learning through the clear definition of the involved steps. As such, it can be also used in training capacity, assisting the implementation and overall design of ML studies in Life Sciences. More information can be found on the .

Professionalising Careers in Research Infrastructures 








As a research infrastructure (RI), ELIXIR relies upon a diverse range of roles, such as trainers, data stewards, project managers, software engineers, developers, community managers. By highlighting the career options within a research infrastructure, we aim to promote interest in these roles to support the career development of researchers beyond the traditional academic paths of, for example, Principal Investigators.
As well as supporting the research community by recognising infrastructure career paths, this Focus Group will actively contribute to ELIXIR's commitment to diversity and inclusion within the research ecosystem.
Goals of the group
Initially, the Focus Group will conduct a comprehensive survey of existing job advertisements channels (including the past activity) within ELIXIR in order to classify roles (assessing function, hierarchical position, required skills, etc). The planned outcome of this mapping exercise will enhance the compatibility of job titles and clarify the relationships among different roles within ELIXIR. 
The Focus Group will also collaborate with external projects with a related aim, such as , , , ,  or  projects as well as internal ELIXIR projects and entities like ELEAD, ELITMa, , the  and  , , the  and the .

:  ELIXIR has five operational platforms: Data, Tools, Compute, Interoperability and Training. Each platform is led by a leadership team agreed by the . The Platform membership consists of task leads, technical staff and a Platform Coordinator. Each Platform Coordinator provides support to the Platform leaders and ensures that the Platform's activities are aligned to its goals.
: ELIXIR has whose aim is to drive the development of the ELIXIR infrastructure from different user perspectives. These include a group of Human Data Communities. Four Communities were initiated during the with others being added continuously to broaden ELIXIR's user base.
Coordinator groups

 is comprised of technical representatives from each ELIXIR Node. The group identifies gaps and promotes connections among Nodes and Platforms. It is the responsibility of the TeCG to explore technical opportunities and issues aiming to provide advice and recommendations. The TeCG is connected with Platforms through Node technical representatives actively involved in the implementation of Platforms.
 is composed of training representatives of each of the ELIXIR Nodes. TrCG meets regularly to share information, expertise and to coordinate and lead the implementation of the ELIXIR training strategy across Europe.
The Node Coordinators Group is composed of representatives from ELIXIR Nodes. The purpose of the group is to share information and best practise in the operations of the ELIXIR Node. In many ELIXIR Nodes, the Node Coordinator is a key operational position funded by national funding.

Three new Focus Groups to advance professional careers and pathogen data sharing








ELIXIR welcomes three new Focus Groups: Learning Paths, Professionalising Careers in Research Infrastructures and Pathogens Data.
ELIXIR Focus Groups are time-limited groups bringing people together around a particular topic, typically to address emerging areas of interest. Focus Groups are open to any member of ELIXIR and, in some cases, external parties. The addition of three new groups brings the total number of Focus Groups in ELIXIR to 11.
The three new groups all support the aims of ELIXIR new Science Programme 2024-28. Learning paths are structured routes guiding individuals through a sequence of courses or training materials, designed to make it easier to achieve specific learning goals. The Learning Path Focus Group, along with the Professionalising Careers in Research Infrastructures Focus Group, further the aims of ELIXIR new Science Programme 2024-28 by promoting professional development. The Pathogens Data Focus Group advances a new scientific priority area in the Programme  Biodiversity, Food Security and Pathogens.
Learning Paths
The group will share knowledge, ideas and experiences to identify needs, devise solutions and advocate for the widespread adoption of learning paths across ELIXIR. Led by Alexia Cardona (ELIXIR UK), Loredana Le Pera (ELIXIR Italy) and Jessica Lindvall (ELIXIR Sweden) it has two main goals:

Explore strategies for the development of structured learning programmes
Promote the use of learning path guidelines in ELIXIR

These activities will address the current lack of guidance in ELIXIR for developing curricula and structured training programs, with the overall aim of enhancing the experience of learners.
Professionalising Careers in Research Infrastructures
The group will support the career development and improve recognition of research infrastructure roles such as trainer, data steward, project manager, software engineer, developer and community manager.
Initially, the group will conduct a survey of job advertisements within ELIXIR to classify roles analysing specifications, grades and skills. The mapping exercise will improve the standardisation of job titles and clarify the relationships among different roles.
The group is led by Lisanna Paladin (ELIXIR Germany), Emma Karoune (ELIXIR UK) and Jessica Lindvall (ELIXIR Sweden).
Pathogens Data
The Pathogen Data Focus Group will support global genomics-based surveillance and research of infectious diseases, by laying the groundwork for a distributed and interoperable network of regional and national pathogen data platforms. This will be achieved by:

Agreeing on data, metadata and analysis standards and promoting their use and reuse
Promoting FAIR and equitable data sharing
Proposing benchmark datasets and quality assessments
Building capacity for pandemic preparedness through training, maturity models and tools
Liaising with global pathogen genomics epidemiology initiatives and entities such as PHA4GE, GMI, WHO, ECDC

The group is led by Aitana Neves (ELIXIR Switzerland), Isabel Cuesta De La Plaza (ELIXIR Spain) and Erik Hjerde (ELIXIR Norway).

ELIXIR welcomes two new Communities - Research Data Management and Microbiome








Two new Communities have been formed in ELIXIR: Research Data Management (RDM) and Microbiome.
ELIXIR Communities bring together experts across ELIXIR Nodes and external partners to coordinate activities within specific areas. The addition of two Communities brings the number to 17, spanning domains such as human data, single-cell omics and Galaxy.
Research Data Management (RDM)
The RDM Community focuses on implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and open science principles. Led by Munazah Andrabi (ELIXIR UK), Flora D'Anna (ELIXIR Belgium), Niclas Jareborg (ELIXIR Sweden) and Mijke Jetten (ELIXIR Netherlands), it aims to unify RDM resources across ELIXIR leading to more sustainable data management practices. The Community will concentrate on four areas:

People network: Establish a forum for life science RDM professionals to exchange knowledge and develop RDM service capacities across ELIXIR Nodes.
RDM knowledge: Coordinate efforts to ensure RDM ecosystem content is up-to-date and collect input for enhancing the flow and FAIRness of data from research to repositories.
RDM training: Provide a platform for exchanging best practices among RDM trainers, developing training materials, and establishing RDM learning paths.
External stakeholders: Manage relationships with external stakeholders involved in RDM across ELIXIR Platforms Communities and Focus Groups.

Microbiome
The Microbiome Community aims to enhance microbiome research through the promotion of standards for sequence analysis and multi-omics integration. It focuses on identifying training gaps, methods, and reference databases and aims to scale bioinformatics infrastructures for microbiome research. The Community co-leads are Brnice Batut (ELIXIR France), Rob Finn (EMBL-EBI) and Eric Pelletier (ELIXIR France). The Community is an evolution of the Marine Metagenomics Community, and has three broad goals:

Develop standards for FAIR microbiome analyses: Establish controlled vocabularies, metadata quality checks, international collaboration for e-infrastructure harmonisation and dedicated training modules for microbiome metadata.
Enhance tools and workflows: Improve annotation tools, leverage benchmarking initiatives, and share workflow designs for microbiome research, promoting best practices and federated computation.
Build capacity and community engagement: Create a catalogue of training resources, address knowledge gaps and foster a community of trainers to represent the Microbiome Community's complexity and needs, including connecting with the industry and representing the Community at international levels.

Tim Hubbard starts as ELIXIR Director








Today, 1 March 2024, the ELIXIR Hub welcomes Tim Hubbard in his new role as ELIXIR Director. Andy Smith remains Interim Director until 31 May, with responsibilities gradually transitioning to Tim.
Tim joins ELIXIR from King's College London where he was Professor of Bioinformatics in the Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics. He has also acted as Senior Advisor at Genomics England and Associate Director of the London region of Health Data Research UK (HDR UK).
Andy welcomed Tim to ELIXIR, saying We are delighted that Tim has joined ELIXIR as our new Director. We are at an important phase in ELIXIRs operations, with the implementation of our 2024-28 Scientific Programme now underway. Tims long-term vision and experience in bioinformatics service delivery will help ensure that these activities bring value to ELIXIRs stakeholders across Europe and beyond.
Alexander Goesmann, Chair of the ELIXIR Board, commented The Board warmly welcome Tim as ELIXIRs new Director. Based on his many years of experience, we are confident that ELIXIR is in capable hands. The Board looks forward to working with Tim and wish him well as he starts in his new role.
Tim said Its exciting to be starting at ELIXIR today at the beginning of the 2024-28 Programme, with new European-wide initiatives in molecular data, software and services. There are huge opportunities for the future use of biomedical data, such as through the increasingly pervasive impact of artificial intelligence and initiatives such as the European Health Data Space. The ELIXIR infrastructure can play a major enabling role, helping maximise the benefit for all.

ELIXIR privacy statement








This Privacy Policy explains what personal data is collected by ELIXIR, why we collect your data, how it is processed, and how we keep it secure. Information on data transfers to third-party processors acting on our behalf is provided below.
ELIXIR operates under the data protection framework provided by  - known as  - which is adapted to the needs of international scientific research and reflects the principles of European data protection law. Details of your rights under IP68 are summarised below, along with the contact details if you have any queries or requests concerning your data:





For privacy information relating to cookies, see the .
Way that we collect personal data:







The public website ()
The data we collect: if you browse the public website then the following information is logged by our server: your browser, operating system, IP address, the date and time of your visit, the pages visited, and the amount of data transferred.  
Why we collect the data: the data is used to monitor for suspicious activities (e.g. attempts to hack the site), to diagnose problems on the site, and to create anonymous usage statistics. We do not attempt to identify or profile people based on this data.
Lawful basis for processing the data: processing this data is necessary for our legitimate interest of allowing the website to remain secure and robust. 
Who has access to the data: the personal data is only accessible to staff in the ELIXIR Hub who work on the website and the Linode support team (see 'Third party processors' below).
Data transfer: this data is located on a server in London, UK, and is not transferred to any other country.
Data retention: we will keep web logs 30 days and security logs 90 days before anonymising them.
Third party processors: the ELIXIR web server was created using the cloud hosting service . The personal data outlined above is stored on the ELIXIR Hub's Linode server. The Linode support team have access to the server so they can fix problems on it and upgrade it, but the personal data is not processed further by them or transferred to another organisation. See the  for how Linode comply with the GDPR. For privacy questions concerning Linode contact privacy [at] linode.com, and see the .
ELIXIR-coordinated projects
ELIXIR coordinates projects funded by organisations such as the  and the  (see the  for the current projects). Participants in these projects are included on the relevant project mailing lists to ensure that they can coordinate their work.
Project Data Management Plan (DMP): Following EC and IMI requirements, a project data management plan is mandatory for each project, and accessible via the EC portal. For additional information please contact grants [at] elixir-europe.org.
The data we collect: the contact details (names and email addresses) of the projects participants. Participants are also asked for their institute address and their phone number, in case we need to send documents or contact them urgently (e.g. to tell them about changes to meetings), but these are optional fields.
Lawful basis for processing the data: legitimate interest, since we need to communicate with participants in order to run the project, and the participants need to communicate with each other to coordinate their tasks within the projects. 
Who has access to the data: other members of the project have access to the participants' contact information (name and email address).
Data transfer: Your data is not transferred from ELIXIR to any other organisation.
Data retention: your data will be retained for the duration of the project and deleted from the project records according to the obligations set by funders to keep records for auditing purposes.
Unsubscribing: if you would like to leave the project and unsubscribe from any project mailing lists mailing list please email grants [at] elixir-europe.org. 
The intranet and internal mailing lists
The intranet () is a restricted part of the main ELIXIR website (see the section above) and sits on the same server. The intranet is open to members of ELIXIR and its governing bodies only. 
When you join a group on the intranet you automatically get subscribed to that group's mailing list. You also automatically become a member of any parent groups and their mailing lists. For example, if you joined the Bioschemas group you would automatically join the Bioschemas mailing list. You would also become a member of the Bioschemas parent group, Interoperability, and join the Interoperability mailing list. This functionality is designed to keep you informed of closely related matters across ELIXIR.
 The purpose of the intranet and the mailing lists is to help people across the organisation work together. You log in to the intranet using the , which allows you to log in using third party identity providers (e.g. using your Google account or your university ID).
The data we collect: the Life Science Login provides us with your name, email and your ELIXIR group memberships. In addition you may enter more information about yourself in your user profile page. 
Why we collect the data: to allow you to log in to the intranet and see material restricted to ELIXIR members and collaborators, to subscribe you to the mailing list of your groups, and to create a user profile page for you so that you and other members of ELIXIR can see who is a member of which group. We also collect emails so people who have created new group content on the site (like an event or document) can alert other members of the group that this has happened. Emails are not shown to other members of the intranet.
Lawful basis for processing the data: legitimate interest, since in order to carry out your work as part of ELIXIR you need to be informed of deadlines and meetings concerning your work, and need to have access to information restricted to the intranet. If you stop working for ELIXIR, please email webmaster [at] elixir-europe.org so that we can remove you from the groups and mailing lists.
Who has access to the data: other members of the intranet can view your user profile information and group memberships, but only website administrators at the ELIXIR Hub can view your email address.
Data transfer: this data is located on a server in London, UK. Your data is not transferred from the ELIXIR intranet to anywhere else.
Data retention: your data will be deleted after two years of inactivity (of not logging in to the website or sending emails to your groups). It will also be deleted once we are informed that you have stopped working for ELIXIR.
Life Science Login: the ELIXIR intranet uses the Life Science Login to enable people to log in. For information on how your data is processed by the Life Science Login and who to contact about it see the . You can view the information that the Life Science Login holds about you by going to your .
Unsubscribing: if you would like to unsubscribe from a mailing list please email webmaster [at] elixir-europe.org and we will remove you from the appropriate group, or from our system altogether. Alternatively, you can log in to the intranet and user the  to manage your group/mailing list memberships.
Public newsletters
These include the Informed and the Industry stakeholder newsletters. We use the  mailing service to send these.
The data we collect: the sign-up form for newsletters requires your email address, with optional fields for your name and organisation. In addition, Mailchimp records which newsletters you opened and which links you clicked.  
Why we collect the data: to enable us to send emails, to measure the success of the emails, to help us provide reports to funders, and to help us improve the newsletters
Lawful basis for processing the data: this data is only processed with your explicit consent. The sign-up form asks for this consent.
Who has access to the data: the personal data is only accessible to staff in the ELIXIR Hub who manage the emails (members of the External Relations team).
Data transfer: MailChimp is based in the United States and the data is held on servers located there.
Data retention: We will keep your personal data for as long as you wish to remain on the mailing list.
Third party processors: the mailing lists service is run by MailChimp. MailChimp is certified to the  and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield.

This site does not use tracking cookies. The cookies that may be set on your browser are described below:
Authentication cookies
When you log in to the intranet, cookies needs to be set so that the website server knows you are logged in. If the cookies were not set, you would find yourself logged out each time you went to a different page. These cookies are:

SimpleSAMLAuthToken
SimpleSAMLSessionID
SSESS + [long number]

The first two of these may persist after you have logged out. This is to make it quicker for you to log in next time, although they will expire after three weeks. These cookies are essential for the function of the intranet.
If you do not log in to the intranet, then these cookies will not be set.
YouTube and Twitter cookies
By default, an embedded YouTube video or Twitter timeline will set tracking cookies in your browser. We have turned this functionality off. The YouTube videos on this site, for example, are served from youtube-nocookie.com, rather than youtube.com. Note that even in this "privacy-enhanced mode" YouTube may set cookies, but these are claimed to be essential for their service. See their . These cookies will only be set on pages containing a YouTube video.
