Helios
The HL7 FHIR Accelerator for Public Health

 for more information.
What Needs Does Helios Seek to Address? 
Public health is only as strong as its weakest link. While considerable progress has been made in the ways public health accesses, exchanges, and integrates data, ongoing challenges persist.
Helios is an alliance of government, private sector, and philanthropic partners that are committed to the equitable and effective use of data for the advancement of public health. Members will help ensure data modernization efforts in public health incorporate market-based solutions that incentivize participation and are compatible with nationwide interoperability priorities.
Why Focus on FHIR-Based Standards and Approaches to Interoperability?
Public health is complex. It operates at all levels of government and with many partners across the healthcare sector and beyond, which creates challenges in coordinating efforts around data. The HL7 FHIR community has faced similar challenges and has successfully overcome them. Specific implementations of FHIR are being regulated and incentivized in the United States in ways that provide significant momentum, and some parts of public health are already using whats been built by the FHIR community. 
Helios will provide streamlined ways for diverse stakeholders to get on the same page, reuse what works, and fill in gaps to meet high-priority, cross-cutting public health needs. This streamlining will help to ensure FHIR-based solutions are integrated, aligned, and are a complement to everything else that's going on across public health.
Why the Name Helios?
Helios is the ancient Greek god of the sun  a symbol of transparency and healing. Its a reminder to stay focused on solutions that arent just good in theory but that work in production. 






Join Helios
Help us deliver better data that lead to better health outcomes. 
Membership is open to state, tribal, local, territorial, and Federal public health agencies, private and philanthropic sector partners, and other groups interested in the equitable and effective use of data for the advancement of public health. 
Our goal is to help overcome barriers to adoption, promote market-based solutions that are compatible with nationwide interoperability priorities, and ensure scalability and long-term sustainability of data modernization investments made with Federal funds.

HL7 Vision
A world in which everyone can securely access and use the right health data when and where they need it.
HL7 Mission
To provide standards that empower global health data interoperability.

HL7 - What Does it Mean?
"Level Seven" refers to the seventh level of the International Organization 
		for Standardization (ISO) seven-layer communications model for Open Systems 
		Interconnection (OSI) - the application level. The application level interfaces 
		directly to and performs common application services for the application processes.  
		Although other protocols have largely superseded it, the OSI model remains valuable 
		as a place to begin the study of network architecture.

General Information About HL7



 What is Health Level Seven International (HL7)?

 Founded in 1987, Health Level Seven International is a non-for-profit, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) -accredited Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) serving the healthcare industry with a focus on clinical and administrative data. HL7 is supported by members from over 50 countries, including over 500 corporate members representing healthcare providers, government stakeholders, payers, pharmaceutical companies, vendors/suppliers and consulting firms.



 What does the name HL7 mean?

 The name HL7 comes from the seven levels of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Level Seven is the Application Level.



 What does HL7 do?

 HL7 provides standards and solutions for the healthcare industry's interoperability challenges. HL7 is dedicated to producing comprehensive framework and related standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information that supports clinical practice and the management, delivery and evaluation of health services.



 What is HL7's vision and mission?

HL7 Vision: A world in which everyone can securely access and use the right health data when and where they need it.

HL7 Mission: To provide standards that empower global health data interoperability.



 What is interoperability?

 Interoperability refers to the ability of applications to exchange and make use of information. For further information, please visit the interoperability page on the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT at: .



 What is a standard?

 A standard is a document, established by consensus that provides rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results. (As defined in ISO/IEC Guide 2:1996). HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information. These standards define how information is packaged and communicated from one party to another, setting the language, structure and data types required for seamless integration between systems. HL7 standards support clinical practice and the management, delivery, and evaluation of health services, and are recognized as the most commonly used in the world.

 For example, HL7's Version 2 (V2) is a widely adopted "messaging standard" around the globe that will continue to be in place for a very long time. HL7's newest standard, the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard is described as a next generation "API standard" framework combining the best features of HL7's Version 2, Version 3 and CDA product lines while leveraging the latest web standards and applying a tight focus on implementability. FHIR is an interoperability standard intended to facilitate the exchange of healthcare information between organizations. It consists of 2 main parts: a content model in the form of 'resources', and a specification for the exchange of these resources in the form of real-time RESTful interfaces as well as messaging and Documents. These features of FHIR promote compatibility with electronic health records and make it particularly useful for creating mobile phone apps, cloud communications and EHR-based data sharing.

Licensing of SNOMED CT in HL7 Products



 What is licensing of SNOMED CT in HL7 products?

 The following key points are provided by the SNOMED to confirm the SNOMED CT licensing arrangements that have been agreed between SNOMED and HL7 International. These are in line with the condition set out in the SNOMED CT Affiliate license agreement and do not replace them. For further information, first review SNOMED CT licensing information and then contact  to discuss your specific requirements for a license.



 Can HL7 access the full scope of SNOMED CT when developing HL7 documents, irrespective of their status in terms of being in an IHTSDO member country?

 HL7 International working group members can access SNOMED CT if they are participating in the development of HL7 International products. A development license has been provided by SNOMED to HL7 International, and HL7 International has set up a mechanism to access SNOMED CT (International version). Please contact Karen Van Hentenryck, Associate Executive Director, HL7 International, for further information on accessing SNOMED CT for this work. An individual SNOMED CT affiliate license is not required for this purpose.



 Is it true that any user of HL7 specifications who have agreed to the HL7 development license of SNOMED CT can receive, store, display and communicate SNOMED CT concept identifiers and terms within the scope of the agreement?

 No. HL7 International work group members can access SNOMED CT for development of international products under the HL7/SNOMED agreement, using the agreed mechanism. If an HL7 member is accessing an HL7 International product containing SNOMED CT to use, deploy or distribute, they must have an affiliate license for which they apply to SNOMED (web link above). Please be aware that fees may apply for SNOMED non-member countries.



 Does the HL7 development license only cover SNOMED CT International?

 Yes. The development license agreed between SNOMED and HL7 International covers the use of SNOMED CT International release in HL7 International products



 Are both extensional and intensional SNOMED CT values in HL7 International products included in the development agreement?

 The development license covers both intensional and extensional SNOMED CT value sets in HL7 international products.



 How can the licensing process be made simple and clearer?

 HL7 International is putting in place a licensing statement for all terminologies they use in their products for when users download an HL7 International product. The licensing statement makes it clear that users are responsible for obtaining the appropriate license.



 If an HL7 affiliate in an IHTSDO non-member country takes a code and description from an HL7 International repository or standard and uses the IHTSDO browser to assist in mapping to local codes, is a license required?

 The agreement between HL7 International and SNOMED is for the development of HL7 International products and not for use, use requires an affiliate license in SNOMED non-member countries which may involve a fee. (Note: The situation may change if HL7 International and SNOMED agree a set of SNOMED CT International codes and descriptions which can be used for free globally in HL7 International products)



 HL7 International is exploring the publication considerations and requirements for standards and repositories i.e. standards may use intensional definitions which need to be applied by a terminology service. HL7 FHIR may render these instructions and deliver codes and descriptions to users of the standards. Does HL7 International need a specific license for use of SNOMED CT in our standards, and in terminology services?

 HL7 International can publish products using SNOMED CT International that have been developed using the development license for HL7 International products.



 What type of restrictions/access requirements will be applied as part of the development license applied when developing HL7 International products?

 As discussed above, HL7 International is providing access to SNOMED CT International for HL7 International work group members who are contributing to the development of HL7 International products. The portal will require registration of the individual and the piece of work they are contributing to which requires this access.



 A request for the expansion of an intensional value set is done by a terminology server via an API. What access reporting requirements are necessary from the host of the terminology server and what are the licensing requirements for the requester?

 Assuming the terminology server is in an SNOMED Member country, any person or organization downloading from an IHTSDO member country's terminology server is individually responsible for ensuring they have the appropriate license to use SNOMED CT.
Balloting



 What is the Ballot Desktop?

 The ballot desktop is the central site where you can:


  Join ballot pools

  Locate Ballot material

  Cast a vote

  Examine voting tallies

  Examine comments from voters


 The tabs at the top of the page allow you to navigate between the Home page, Voting page, and Tally page. The ballot desktop is located at: 



 How do I get to the ballot website?

 The ballot desktop is located at 



 What do the ballot types mean?

 There are four basic types of ballots - the letter designations indicate the ballot level:

 N - Normative
 I - Informative
 D - Standard for Trial Use
 O - Comment

 

Normative - A normative ballot is intended to process and validate those specifications intended for submission to ANSI for consideration as American National Standards.

 The normative ballot process shall adhere to the tenets of ANSI Essential Requirements: Due process requirements for American National Standards.

 Under normal circumstances the subject matter of a normative ballot will have at some point been subjected to a review ballot; however, there are a number of scenarios where material may need to move directly to normative ballot, such as the need to respond to government mandate or to resolve a critical issue raised by a stakeholder or noted in an existing American National Standard.

Informative - An informative document is the product of a work group that is not currently deemed normative, but nonetheless is intended for general publication. It explains or supports the structure of the specifications, or provides detailed information regarding the interpretation or implementation of an HL7 specification.

 A work group may declare an informative document as US Realm-specific in that its function is to constrain a specification for implementation in the United States of America (USA).

Standard for Trial Use (STU) - STU is used to provide the basis for proof of concept pilot projects and objective assessment of the viability of implementation of the proposed standard.

For Comment Only - A work group may submit proposed content or requirements documents, such as a domain analysis model (DAM), to comment-only review. The intent is to gather input from members outside of the work group on the viability and clarity of the proposed content or requirements document. The review of proposed content or requirements documents does not seek a vote, per se, but will capture all comments.

 A ballot to reaffirm an HL7 American National Standard (ANS) shall be submitted to a Comment-only Ballot to allow interested parties to express their opinion by supporting reaffirmation, suggesting revisions to update the ANS, or providing reasons to withdraw the ANS.



 How do I sign up for a ballot?

 Navigate to the Ballot Desktop at . Signed-in Members should see on the "Home" tab a link to "Join a consensus group". Non-members can navigate to the ballot desktop but will need to pay fees to ballot.



 How do I cast a vote?

 Use the "Vote" tab on the Ballot Desktop at 



 How do I find out more information on what the ballot is about?

 Please look up the related ballot item's project definition in Project Insight. There are over twenty (20) product types in HL7.


  Those voting should understand the product type that is being balloted

  Product type is found in Project Insight

  Ballot materials will either be found on a link from the ballot website or presented for download

Standards
Where can I find the Intellectual Property (IP)?
HL7 licenses the use of much of its IP at no cost. You can find all of our standards under the Standards tab.
What are the steps to download the Intellectual Property (IP)?
All users must complete a click-through license registration process to participate. Members use their usual HL7.org login and non-members need to create an account. Find the standard you want via the Standards tab and follow the prompts including agreeing to the terms of the license.
I'm trying to download a standard, but I can't find it!
The standards are available for download from the Standards section of the website. To access the downloads, log into the HL7 website (must be logged-in to be able to download) and click on the Standards link in the main navigation, then click the standard for which you wish to download documents. Affiliate members may also access this information by following their affiliate download link to the HL7 website. If you are an affiliate member and need additional help finding this link, please contact your affiliate. You must be a member in good standing to access the members' only documents on the Standards section of the website (those that are restricted to members-only for the first 90 days of release).
Why do non-members have to create a username and password (i.e. register on the website) to download a standard?
We need to uniquely identify each individual in order to provide a license.
What material is available at no cost?
Standards that have already received ANSI approval are licensed at no cost. Additionally, published implementation guides, profiles and domain analysis models (DAM), and current (although not expired) standards for trial use (STU) are licensed at no cost. HL7 members have early access to new HL7 standards as a member-only benefit; these will be licensed free-of-charge to non-members after three months.
What other select intellectual property (IP) is available besides standards and implementation guides?
Profiles and domain analysis models (DAMs) are considered other select IP. The HL7 Board determines on a case-by-case basis whether other IP such as tools will be licensed for at no cost.
Are domain analysis models (DAMS) and functional profiles licensed at no cost?
Yes.
Can I download the whole Normative Edition at no cost?
Yes. The most current version of the Normative Edition is available for download at no cost to non-members three months after publication. Members have immediate access to all versions of the Normative Editions.
Are HL7 standards in the public domain?
No. Our standards and selected intellectual property (IP) are available at no cost under a licensing agreement by which HL7 retains its copyright and specific terms apply.
Are users able to modify HL7 standards?
No. HL7 retains the copyright and follows current processes to make any needed changes in the standards. Users are freely able to study, implement and develop products based on HL7 standards and create implementation profiles under the licensing terms. The HL7 member community develops and maintains HL7 standards and other HL7 products through HL7 International as an accredited standards development organization (SDO), and in collaboration with its international affiliates, which also produce realm localizations.What is a derivative work?
An example of a derivative work is an implementation guide. The US Copyright Office defines derivative work as follows: A derivative work is a work based on or derived from one or more already existing works. Also known as a "new version," a derivative work is copyrightable if it includes what copyright law calls an "original work of authorship." Any work in which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship is a derivative work or a new version.
I am an individual member. What types of derivative works can I create?
Individual members can create the same types of derivative works as non-members as explained below.
I am not a member. Can I create derivative works?
HL7 authorizes non-members to create the following derivative works:

Implementation guides for internal use only. Distribution of these outside your organization is not permitted.
Profiles that assert conformance of a product to HL7 standards. Such conformance profiles may be distributed without limitation.
Translations of HL7 material into executable code or other machine processable form which results in the creation of a new work (in the form of an adaptation) that implements the material and is not regarded as a reproduction and distribution of excerpts. Such machine processable implementations (for example, interface software products) may be distributed without limitation.
Technical documentation of your system(s); this may be created and distributed without limitation.
Educational materials; these may be created and published without limitation.
Translations of any of the above.

Under the normal HL7 license terms these derivative works may not contain excerpts of HL7 copyright material not otherwise permitted under US copyright law and may not carry the HL7 logo nor state or imply that they are endorsed by HL7.
Who do I contact to get permission to create a derivative work not on the list above and what is the process for approving such a request?
Requests to create or publish a derivative work should be addressed to . The HL7 Executive Committee will review and decide on all derivative work requests that fall outside those authorized under the normal license terms.
I'm an individual, student or health professional member. Why can't I share the freely licensed standards with others?
HL7 is the sole licensing agent for its standards. We remain the source of truth by requiring people to come to our website and obtain a license. This also enables HL7 to track who is using its standards and which standards are being used most frequently. Collection of this type of data, which drives standards developments, is not possible if we allow everyone to share the standards with whomever they like. Organizational members are allowed to share the standards internally with their employees. Learn more at .
What happens if I don't confirm or update my contact information?
You will be unable to download any more standards.
What will be done with the information that is collected on the license agreements?
We will be tracking all standards that are being accessed and by which stakeholders. We hope to observe trends that will help us better understand our customers and their needs.
Why can't I put your freely licensed standards on my intranet or share with my employees?
Those wishing to share HL7 standards on their intranet or with their employees should become organizational members of HL7. While a non-member organization can accept a license for HL7 standards, each employee from that organization who wishes to use the standard must obtain a license via the HL7 website.
Why do I have to annually confirm or update my contact information?
HL7 tracks the use of its standards. We cannot track this type of data without having current data on our licensees. Since the standards are being licensed at no cost, we do not feel that it is an unreasonable request for users to confirm or refresh their contact data annually. Information provided will not be shared with others and will be used for HL7 purposes only.
What does my organization need to do to become HL7 compliant?
You will need to secure a copy of the standard, which provides the messages (by domain) that any system claiming compliance to HL7 should be able to send/receive. HL7 standards are freely available for download, under licensing terms, from the  section of the HL7 website. 
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
How do I learn more about using HL7 Trademarks?
Learn more by visiting our Guide to Using HL7 Trademarks page at: 
Where can I find HL7 Branding Guidelines?
For information on how to use HL7 branded logos, please download the .
Can members use Health Level Seven-owned trademarks?
Any use of Health Level Seven-owned trademarks (including the HL7 FHIR flame logo) to brand your product or service must be approved in writing by Health Level Seven by submitting a formal request via the . You may mention HL7, FHIR or other Health Level Seven-owned trademarks if you are using the trademarks in a plain language or "fair use" situation. Under fair use you may also use the HL7 logo as a link to www.HL7.org, and the HL7 FHIR logo to link to www.FHIR.org without requesting permission. See examples of "fair use" below. All uses of the [FLAME DESIGN] logo require the  symbol. To seek approval to use an HL7 trademark to brand your product or service, send a request to .
Really?
Really. If people use the Health Level Seven-owned trademarks without permission, it will likely create confusion as to what products or services are officially produced or authorized by Health Level Seven. This confusion damages Health Level Seven and its ability to serve members today and in the future.
Are you telling me that I can't even mention HL7 or FHIR or other Health Level Seven-owned trademarks?
You cannot use Health Level Seven-owned trademarks to brand your own products or services without written permission. You may, however, mention HL7 or HL7 FHIR or other Health Level Seven-owned trademarks if you are using the trademarks in a plain language manner rather as a brand for your goods or services  if you are making what is often called a "fair use".
Sounds like your lawyer wrote that last one. Can you help me out with some examples?
Sure. Ask yourself this: Does your contemplated use of Health Level Seven-owned trademarks refer to you or your services, or does it refer to Health Level Seven or its services? If the usage refers to something owned by Health Level Seven, then it is likely an acceptable "fair use". If it refers to something owned by you or someone else, then it is an unacceptable "trademark use". Below are some examples of "Fair Use":

We provide all the training you need to comply with the HL7 FHIR standard.
The CDA standard supports efficient inter-enterprise information exchange.
HL7s CCD implementation guide enables providers to effectively share patient summary data.

Unacceptable "Trademark Use":

Check out our FHIR IN THE HOLE workshop in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Our CDA AGENT software automates document creation.
Here at CCD CONNECTIONS, we use the latest technology to help medical teams communicate without loss of meaning and to enable improved patient care.

The HL7 FHIR standard is open source. Doesn't that mean that I can use the HL7 FHIR mark whenever I want?
No. Many open source product licenses explicitly exclude rights to trademarks. See, e.g., .
We encourage everyone to explore improving the HL7 FHIR standard, but only after a modified version is reviewed and approved by HL7 is it allowed to bear the HL7 FHIR mark. HL7 trademarks protect our members by giving them the confidence to know that a particular version of a standard is consistent with the values and approved by HL7.
For more information about the HL7 FHIR mark, please read the  (pdf) and the  (pdf).
Are there times when I can use HL7 Trademarks without asking?
You may use the trademarks without asking for HL7 events (e.g., HL7 training course) that promote our common mission and are intended to be predominantly attended by HL7 members and sponsored by HL7. Using an HL7 trademark to promote non-HL7-sponsored conferences and meetings require a license.
You may use the non-stylized HL7 Word Mark to:

Describe Community project (e.g. "Get trained in HL7 FHIR!"). 
Derivative work of a Community project in a way that is not misleading (e.g. "This standard is derived from the HL7 FHIR standard, but is not affiliated with, or approved or sponsored by, HL7) 
Make truthful statements about the HL7 standards and/or projects in news reports and commentary (e.g., The HL7 Working Group Meeting convened last week in San Antonio, TX). 
Make truthful statements about the HL7 projects in personal blogs and social media as long as you do not imply endorsement by or affiliation to HL7. To avoid confusion, please do not use HL7 Word Marks in the background, as your profile image, or in the header of your blog. You should also not use the marks in the name of your blog or in your social media username. 
Discuss HL7 projects in artistic, scientific, literary, and political work or in presentations at public conferences. Please, however, send us a request via the  if you want to place the FHIR Word Mark on the cover of your book or organize an event or presentation that could be interpreted to be endorsed by HL7. 

When do I need to apply for an HL7 FHIR trademark license?
You need a license whenever you want to:

List HL7 as a sponsor of your event or member of your group or collaborative
Use one of the HL7 trademarks to promote a product (software or swag handout), event (such as a hackathon or conference), or service (such as consulting or training).
Use the HL7 Word Marks in a product name, domain, social media handle, blog name or web page title (other than those associated directly with HL7).

Once I get a license to use the Powered by HL7 FHIR mark on my product or event , can I declare my product or event as conforming to FHIR or endorsed by HL7?
You can state that your product uses the HL7 FHIR specification under fair use, but you cannot claim conformance until such time as formal conformance requirements have been published for FHIR, and you've met any conformance testing requirements.
So if I'm using it in one of these "fair use" instances without a license, are there any rules I have to follow?
Yes, you should adhere to the following rules:

Include the following notice for the word mark and flame logo respectively placed near the first reference to the mark (once is enough) "FHIR is the registered trademark of Health Level Seven International and the use does not constitute endorsement by HL7." "The Flame Design mark is the registered trademark of Health Level Seven International and the use does not constitute endorsement by HL7."
If space is constrained (as on a mobile device) you can include the registered trademark  symbol after the FHIR Mark at least once on each page (if applicable) and generally in connection with the first or dominant usage.

I'm offering a public training course at my university on FHIR, called "FHIR for Beginners" and preparing an ad. Do I need a license?
Yes, you will need a license to use the Powered by HL7 FHIR mark, and you have to use the formal mark along with the proper notice. But it would be OK to generically refer to a training class on HL7 FHIR in the body of a document or posting without requesting a license, since that's fair use. But you can't use the marks in the name of this product/service without permission.
I'm teaching a class on FHIR at a HL7-sponsored meeting. Do I need a license?
No, you don't need a license to use the marks for an HL7-sponsored event or project.
What's the bottom line?
It is never OK to use Health Level Seven-owned trademarks in the name of your product or service without prior written consent.
It may be OK to use Health Level Seven-owned trademarks in a regular English-language sentence if you are referring to Health Level Seven itself or an Health Level Seven-owned product or service. See the  for more information.

 HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information. These standards define how information is packaged and communicated from one party to another, setting the language, structure and data types required for seamless integration between systems. HL7 standards support clinical practice and the management, delivery, and evaluation of health services, and are recognized as the most commonly used in the world. For more information about the HL7 standards process, please read .
 HL7 standards are grouped into reference categories:

  -
      Primary standards are considered the most popular standards integral for system integrations, inter-operability and compliance. Our most frequently used and in-demand standards are in this category.



  -
      Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) Products



  -
      These standards provide functional models and profiles that enable the constructs for management of electronic health records.

  -
      The Arden Syntax is a formalism for representing procedural clinical knowledge in order to facilitate the sharing of computerized health knowledge bases among personnel, information systems and institutions



  -
      HL7 Clinical Context Management Specification (CCOW) is aimed at facilitating the integration of applications at the point of use, as a standard for both internal applications programming and runtime environment infrastructure that complements HL7's traditional emphasis on data interchange and enterprise workflow.



  -
      Cross-paradigm/ Logical Level Standards e.g. Domain Analysis Models



  -
      Messaging and document standards for clinical specialties and groups are found in this section. These standards are usually implemented once primary standards for the organization are in place.

HL7 Reference Information Model
The Reference Information Model (RIM) is the cornerstone of the HL7 Version 3 development process. An object model created as part of the Version 3 methodology, the RIM is a large, pictorial representation of the HL7 clinical data (domains) and identifies the life cycle that a message or groups of related messages will carry. It is a shared model between all domains and, as such, is the model from which all domains create their messages. The RIM is an ANSI approved standard.

		This site provides the RIM in various forms - Rose mdl file, XMI, Access data base
		and so forth.  However, it usually does not have the most recent Vocabulary content.
		The most current Access data base for both RIM and Vocabulary is always available
		as a Design Repository ("rimRepos" download) from the HL7 Project Gforge site under the
		


		Versions of the HL7 RIM are available here only
		as Composite ZIP files that contain ALL relevant files for that version.
		The file names within these archives indicate
		the type of information available.
		See a listing of the naming structure, below.
		

 

Current Naming Convention
Specifics of file content within the archives can be found on the  for most of the content.
The following coding is used for the model file names: DDDVVVVT
DDD - Domain - For the HL7 Reference Information Model, this value is always "rim".
VVVV - HL7 Version a four-digit sequence.
T - Type. This refers to the types of files available on the models page. Defined types are:
The type code for the overall composite archive is "c". Thus for RIM 2.38, the composite archive is rim0238c.zip. The contents of this archive is made up of the following file types:

a - Archive, a zip file holding  a MIF archive (mif:package) file whose content is made up the complete current RIM, and change-elements for ALL prior RIM versions. Any given prior RIM can be extracted from this archive.
c - Composite, a ZIP file of ALL of the other ZIP files in this list.
d - Definition the current RIM and current vocabulary represented in "coremif" definition (DEFN) files as a "mif:staticModel" and "mif:vocabularyModel", respectively. These definitions can be opened for browsing with the RoseTree application.
f - Difference, a file (readable in html) that shows where the current RIM differs from the prior version.
g - Graphics, a set of files in Visio and GIF format that contain the graphic expressions for the current model.
i - XMI, an expression of the current RIM in the OMG UML 2.2 XMI standard. Includes the RIM xmi and a collection of "profiles" upon which the RIM is dependent.
n - Notes, complete set of notes and proposals from the RIM harmonization meeting that reviewed the changes that are incorporated in the current models.
r - readMe, a text file with notes about this version of the model and the files that are posted here.
t - Enterprise Architect file, the complete model as an EAP file suitable for loading into Enterprise Architect.
x - XML, a set of small XML files that will be used short-term (during 2012) to inform the V3 Generator of the RIM and data types versions to use for generation.

ANSI Approved Standards

Health Level Seven is one of several 
   (ANSI)
  -accredited Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) operating in the healthcare arena. 
  Most SDOs produce standards (sometimes called specifications or protocols) for a particular 
  healthcare domain such as pharmacy, medical devices, imaging or insurance (claims processing) 
  transactions. Health Level Seven's domain is clinical and administrative data.

Obtaining a CPT Sublicense from HL7
Contact  about how to obtain a sublicense from HL7 for non-production use of CPT for (i) the development and publication of value sets, profiles, and other artifacts as part of the HL7 Implementation Guides, (ii) as part of defined VSAC value sets, and (iii) to support HL7's terminology services within the Territory.
Flow Down Clauses for CPT Sublicense from HL7
CPT content is copyrighted by the American Medical Association and CPT is a registered trademark of the AMA.
HL7, as a party to a license agreement with the AMA, is authorized to grant user a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license for user to use CPT content for (i) the development and publication of value sets, profiles, and other artifacts as part of the HL7 Implementation Guides, (ii) as part of defined VSAC value sets, and (iii) to support HL7's terminology services within the Territory, each of which shall be considered a non-production use. The sublicense granted hereunder shall automatically terminate upon termination of the agreement between HL7 and AMA, unless prior written consent of AMA is obtained.
The provision of updated CPT content is dependent on a continuing contractual relationship between HL7 and the AMA.
User acknowledge a separate license agreement shall be required, and shall govern any proposed use, including any distribution of CPT content for any other purposes not expressly permitted under this Agreement, and the terms of such agreement will govern such use (e.g., a separate license agreement shall govern production use and commercial purposes). AMA reserves the right to accept or reject licenses based on AMA's evaluation of the proposed use of the CPT content.
User acknowledge that User's development and commercialization of CPT-informed works developed with reference to Licensed Products may only be implemented in the Territory.
User is prohibited from making CPT content publicly available, creating derivative works (including translating), transferring, selling, leasing, licensing, or otherwise making available to any unauthorized party the CPT content, or a copy or portion of CPT content to any unauthorized party, including a subsidiary, affiliate, or other legal entity, however designated, for any purpose whatsoever except as expressly permitted under a separate agreement.
User expressly acknowledges and agrees to the extent permitted by applicable law, use of CPT content is at User's sole risk and CPT content is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The AMA does not directly or indirectly practice medicine or dispense medical services. Fee schedules, relative value units, conversion factors and/or related components are not assigned by the AMA, are not part of CPT, and the AMA is not recommending their use. CPT content herein does not replace the AMA's Current Procedural Terminology book or other appropriate coding authority. The coding information contained in CPT content should be used only as a guide.
U.S. Government End Users. CPT is commercial technical data, which was developed exclusively at private expense by the American Medical Association (AMA), 330 North Wabash Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60611. This agreement does not grant the Federal Government a direct license to use CPT based on FAR 52.227- 14 (Data Rights - General) and DFARS 252.227-7015 (Technical Data - Commercial Items).
User expressly consents to the release of its name to the AMA.

We are pleased to be a benefactor member and consider the success of HL7 as strategically important to us. VHA intends to be an early adopter of the HL7 Version 3 model and is particularly excited over the possibilities of XML. We plan to be a major participant in the Government Projects SIG and look forward to partnering with other members as we expand our internal commercial off-the-shelf portfolio and develop additional provider relationships.

Tools & Resources
Various tools and resources are available for people creating and implementing HL7 standards.  The tools and resources 
	that we are aware of are organized below by standards and/or function. If you have further additions to this 
	list, please contact . For documents and resources related
	to HL7 Standards, please check the .
 



        CDA Tools 
       











For Developers: An Open-Source tool suite, allows capturing medical expert requirements and supports terminologies and CDA templates, profiles, implementation guides to reflect and validate technical representations. It features cloud-based federated Building Block Repositories (BBR), fosters re-use of artefacts and is the base for many projects, including large scale National Infrastructure Programmes in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, France and the European Commission.











For Beginners: A navigation website for C-CDA 2.1











 The C-CDA Scorecard promotes best practices in C-CDA implementation by assessing key aspects of the structured data found in individual documents. It is a tool designed to allow implementers to gain insight and information regarding industry best practice and overall usage of the guidance available for using C-CDA to generate high-quality information exchange documents. It also provides a rough quantitative assessment and highlights areas of improvement which can be made today to move the interoperability needle forward. The best practices and quantitative scoring criteria have been developed by HL7 through the HL7-ONC Cooperative agreement to improve the implementation of health care standards. The C-CDA Scorecard does not retain submitted C-CDA files. Submitted files are deleted from the server immediately after processing. However, the tool should not be used with C-CDA documents that contain Protected Health Information (PHI) or Personally Identifiable Information (PII).











For Beginners: The CDA Example Search Tool allows users to search the CDA examples repository.











 The Lantana Validator evaluates CDA documents against the CDA R2 and CDA_SDTC XML Schemas and against any type of implementation guide that has a Schematron rule set. Lantana Consulting Group hosts a public copy of the Validator for open access to over 20 types of documents. Use of the public validator is appropriate for sample, non-PHI files. You can also host the Validator locally and run it using balloted or propriety rules. The validator is updated to include specific IGs upon request.











 The SITE C-CDA Validator validates conformance of C-CDA documents to the standard in order to promote interoperability. You can use it to validate conformance of sample (non-PHI) C-CDA documents to ONC 2014 and 2015 Certification Editions regulations and objectives, or the base HL7 C-CDA Implementation Guide.
 ONC C-CDA Scorecard











 The ONC One-Click Scorecard evaluates the quality of clinical summary documents (C-CDAs) that may include PHI. It uses secure Direct messaging to submit the C-CDA document to be evaluated and to return the results. If you dont have a Direct address to use the tool, you can request a counterparty trust set-up by sending email to sitteam@hhs.gov.











For Developers: The Lantana Trifolia Workbench is a repository of all HL7 CDA templates and implementation guides that have been authored using Trifolia Workbench and balloted through HL7. This tool allows users to browse templates, view their constraints, and generate Microsoft Word and HTML documentation from those templates. Additionally, HL7 members can create Implementation Guides, create templates, and control edit access to its templates. The tool also generates validation artifacts (schematron).

        Vocabulary Resources 
       











 Every copy of the HL7 Vocabulary database incorporated into or distributed in conjunction with another database or software program must is subject to the HL7 End User License Agreement (EULA).
 











 This is a table of external coding systems used in HL7 messages.































 HL7-defined vocabulary domain tables have been developed for coded class attributes and are stored in the HL7 repository. A number of views have been extracted from these to produce the HL7 Vocabulary Domain Listings for the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM).

 COVID Policy


 HL7 International COVID Protection Policy

Approved by the HL7 Executive Committee on December 13, 2021

 After review of the most current evidence provided by public health and safety experts, the HL7 International Board of Directors has determined that HL7 events can be the most robust, productive, interactive and safest conferences possible by requiring full COVID-19 vaccination (as defined by your country/domicile) for entry.

Right of Entry

 HL7 will define specific Right of Entry Protocols that reflect these principles and that comply with prevailing public health guidelines and local public health regulations in the event location. As new developments arise over the coming months, HL7 will continue to refine adopt the most recent requirements for the Right of Entry Protocol as required. At this time, there are no protocols required.

 

 Watch this space for updates and additional details regarding specific events.

 

 




 Upcoming In-Person Events

 The following are the upcoming events which offer an in-person attendance option. Please be sure to follow the specific covid guidelines for each event.

 What is a Working Group Meeting?

 HL7 International working group meetings (WGMs) are held three times per year at varying locations and serve two important purposes:


  To provide HL7 International work groups a chance to meet face to face to work on the standards as well as the opportunity to network with industry leaders from around the world.

  To provide an invaluable educational resource for the healthcare IT community.


 Standards Development

 More than 40 HL7 work groups are dedicated to specialized areas of interest such as Mobile Health and Electronic Health Records. These work groups are directly responsible for the content of the standards and spend much of their time at the WGMs hard at work on standards development.

 Attending a WGM can be a great way to keep up-to-date on what is happening in a particular area, and everyone attending an HL7 WGM is invited to attend any of the work groups.

 Educational Sessions

 HL7 International is pleased to introduce free education sessions included with registration at the May 2024 Working Group Meeting (WGM). Previously, tutorials at the WGMs were an additional cost to daily registration fees. At the May WGM, free education sessions will be offered every quarter. No additional registration is required and all WGM registrants are welcome to participate.

 Topics will include HL7 FHIR and general interoperability and the following categories are expected:

Informational Sessions

 Designed to support new member involvement and help existing members become more effective in their participation in the HL7 standards development process. Examples are First Timer's Orientation, Introduction to the HL7 Organization and Processes, and the HL7 Certification and Credentialing Programs.

Special Topics

 Includes presentations that may involve multiple standards product families. Topics such as Overview of Interoperability or How to Exchange Data Between Electronic Health Records would fall into this category.

HL7 FHIR

 Focused on HL7's Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. This includes interactive presentations intended to bring decision makers and implementers up to speed and ready to use the standard in their own environment.

 Interested in attending but short on funds?

.Scholarships are awarded annually to partially cover travel, accommodation and registration expenses enabling at least one individual to participate in an HL7 WGM. Funding will be sufficient to enable attendance but will require a meaningful and achievable contribution by the award recipient. Awards are anticipated to be $1500-2500 USD per WGM, depending on meeting and award recipient location. Information about the next application period will be posted soon..

Version 3 Certification


 The HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM) is an information model representing all information needed for healthcare interoperability. All HL7 standards can be mapped to the RIM. The HL7 Version 3 (V3) RIM is the foundation on which HL7 V3 messaging is built and has widespread adoption. The HL7 V3 RIM is also the foundation on which HL7's Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is built.

 Why get V3 certified?

 HL7 V3 certification will help you achieve industry-recognized levels of proficiency and expertise. Increase your career opportunities and stand out from the crowd by becoming HL7-certified.

 The V3 RIM Specialist certification exam test proficiency at reading the RIM constructs, knowledge of its content and understanding of its design and application. To pass, you need to be able to identify the classes and structure of the RIM and recognize their use within standards such as CDA.

 Prerequisites and Fees

 There are no prerequisites required to take the V3 RIM Specialist exam. However, we strongly recommend a combination of courses, study resources and practical experience to prepare yourself for the exam. . All HL7 certification and proficiency exams are approved by the VA for reimbursement for eligible veterans. More information is available.

Advisory Council

The healthcare industry is diverse. There are a limited number of elected
 members on the HL7 Board of Directors, and therefore they cannot represent
 all of the areas in healthcare. To address this situation, the Board has asked
 specific individuals from the healthcare industry to participate in the HL7
 Advisory Council. 
Members of the Advisory Council have been chosen based on their: 

 personal experience and background
 ability to listen to the views of others
 ability to provide useful strategic advice to the Board 

The input of the Advisory Council will be critical in helping the Board
 to make decisions. The Advisory Council positions are two-year, nonrenewing
 seats. In the summer of 2004, five industry leaders committed to serving on
 this committee. The first meeting of the Advisory Council was convened on
 July 28, 2004 at Lake Tahoe, CA.

 HL7 Europe Foundation

 The European Office of HL7

 Download the .

 HL7 International established HL7 Europe, its European Office, as a private foundation in Brussels in June 2010 to support its mission in creating HL7 standards and frameworks that are widely and easily used enabling interoperability in healthcare, also serving the specific needs of the European community and its national HL7 affiliates.

 Specifically, HL7 Europe supports the mission of HL7 international through activities focused in cross-border eHealth interoperability in the wider European region by:


  promoting the use of the HL7 framework and protocol specifications

  encouraging the use of the HL7 framework and protocol specifications by health systems and service providers

  Seeking formal accreditation for these HL7 protocol specifications where necessary

  generally, promoting high quality, cost-effective use of information systems in the widest variety of health and healthcare related environments.


 

 Moreover, HL7 Europe may notably contribute directly or indirectly, in collaboration with HL7 affiliates and other stakeholders to the development and adoption of HL7 standards and frameworks:


  Work with International and European Organizations and establish partnerships

  Mobilize resources from the public, private, and philanthropic sectors

  Participate in EU funded programs

  Run campaigns, organize conferences, seminars and fora

  Contribute to and conduct research and studies

  Publish and promote all documentation relating to the use of the framework and protocol specifications developed by HL7 who shall exercise all applicable copyrights to said materials.

  Support and contribute to clinical trials.


 

 The work of HL7 has been recognized by the academic community as notable development of the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) has been published in accredited journals.

 HL7 Europe aims to further mobilize the European community to contribute to these from a European perspective, enabling in collaboration with affiliates easy and consistent implementation.

Balloting Schedule
Please see the 
			for the current balloting schedule



Balloting
Voting on candidate standards and documents is available to both  and .  The Ballot Desktop for voting on candidate standards and documents can be found at the link below:

Please note that to actively vote you must be logged in with a valid voting member id and password.
In addition, one or more overviews of all of the ballots in any ballot cycle are contained in the Announcement Documents found above the listing of Ballot Document pools.  Voters are referred to these announcements for detailed information about the various pools including the Unique Ballot ID used to identify each pool.
The Ballot Desktop will default to the most current Ballot Cycle.  Those interested in voting must join the Ballot Consensus Groups (Ballot Pools)
	they are interested in using the Join a Consensus Group link.  The Signup Close Date for each pool is listed along with the individual
	Ballot Open and Ballot Close dates.
Please note that the Ballot Document links will either provide you with a download of the ballot material(s) or
	link you to a Ballot Site.  
	
Starting in January 2022, all ballot voting except Reaffirmation and Withdrawal Ballots will be done using Jira Balloting. For more information please refer to the Confluence page on 
NOTE: Ballot Comment Spreadsheets are provided for each ballot.  They are located in the zip file found in the far right "Cmnt" column.  This zip file will contain a complete set of ballot comment spreadsheets, so you only need to download it once. Please do not use any old ballot spreadsheets from previous cycles as we continue to make improvements each ballot cycle.
Membership is reminded that ANSI rules dictate that all voting individuals in an initial Normative ballot pool MUST be included in any subsequent Normative ballots. Thus, if a document is going out for a 2nd Normative ballot, all individuals who actively voted in the first ballot are automatically subscribed as members of the pool for the 2nd Normative ballot. If you do not wish to continue to participate, please use the Ballot Desktop to remove yourself from the pool. 






Member Balloting Instructions

Members, please  before accessing the balloting site.






Non-Member Participation

Non-Member participation in HL7 ballots is available to any interested parties, although there is an administrative fee for most of the
			candidate standards and documents.  Any fees for a ballot are detailed on a selection page during the sign-up process.  Fees typically run about $400 per pool, with a maximum not to exceed the
			fee for an individual membership.
Non-members who have not yet signed-up may use the link below and then begin the sign-up process 
				by clicking the Non-Member Participation in this Cycle link 
				in the menu bar at the top of the page, beside the "Ballot Desktop" link.


Non-Members who have already signed up for participation may log in from the page

Books & Study Guides
HL7 FHIR Study Guide
The HL7 FHIR Study Guide will benefit those who want to learn about the HL7 FHIR standard. It will also be useful in preparing for the HL7 FHIR certification examination conducted by HL7 International. The guide covers all HL7 FHIR technical interfacing skills that are highly desired for professionals to perform their job in a proficient manner. Though this guide is intended to be version agnostic, i.e. independent from the current version, some questions may relate to FHIR STU3. Readers are encouraged to use the most recent FHIR version (available online) as a resource.
A study guide is only one tool towards understanding the standard and becoming certified. Studying the material from the study guide is not sufficient to pass the exam. In addition, one should participate in face-to-face (virtual or in-person) and/or online training to complement their study. When preparing, test takers should acquaint themselves with HL7 FHIR R4 Specification which is freely available at .
