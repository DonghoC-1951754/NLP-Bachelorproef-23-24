It consolidates the former EU Open Data Portal and the European Data Portal.The portal is intended to:give access and foster the reuse of European open data among citizens, business and organisations.promote and support the release of more and better-quality metadata and data by the EUs institutions, agencies and other bodies, and European countries, enhancing the transparency of European administrations.educate citizens and organisations about the opportunities that arise from the availability of open data.The two former portals EU Open Data Portal and European Data Portal, launched respectively in 2012 and 2015, were originally established on the basis ofDirective 2003/98/ECto promote accessibility to and the reuse of public sector information. The successor directivesDirective 2013/37/EUandDirective (EU) 2019/1024confirmed and extended its action. The latter invites all the EU Member States to make available their public data resources, contributing to the smooth functioning of the internal market and the proper development of the information society in the EU.Currently in its third iteration, the portal merges the activities of the European Data Portal (which focused exclusively on EU Member States and other European countries) and of the EU Open Data Portal (which served data from the EU institutions, agencies, and bodies) into one.It is funded by the EU and managed operationally by thePublications Office of the European Unionin cooperation with theDirectorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technologyof theEuropean Commission, responsible for EU open data policy.Our mission, vision and valuesThe mission, vision and values of data.europa.eu are part of those from the Publications Office of the European Union (OP) with respect to open data.OP mission. The Publications Office of the European Union is the official provider of publishing services to all EU institutions, bodies, and agencies. As such, it is a central point of access to EU law, publications, open data, research results, procurement notices and other official information. Its mission is to support EU policies and ensure that this broad range of information is available to the public as accessible and reusable data to facilitate transparency, economic activity, and the diffusion of knowledge.OP vision. A well-informed EU, empowered by timely and effective access to trustworthy information and knowledge and benefiting from all the opportunities this brings to society and the economy.OP values.Transparency -- we facilitate transparency throughout the policy cycle of the EU institutions to enhance evidence-based decision-making, accountability, civic participation, and democracy.Trustworthiness -- we strive to ensure that the content we provide is accurate and reliable so that citizens trust the EU as a provider of information.Accessibility -- we believe access to information is a human right that all citizens should enjoy regardless of language, culture, disability, social status, location, technology, or the way they understand information.Service orientation -- we are committed to continuously improving our services to both our institutional stakeholders and EU citizens because we want to contribute to the European project in the best possible way.Translated metadata catalogueThe portal is a metadata catalogue. To foster the comparability of data published across borders, it presents metadata references using the application profile for data portals in Europe (Data Catalogue Vocabulary (DCAT-AP)), using Resource Description Framework (RDF) technology. It provides translations of metadata descriptions in all 24 official EUlanguagesusing machine-translation technologies (eTranslation).In some situations, metadata machine-based translation might not be as efficient as human translation.From raw data to servicesOur services are focused around three main spheres:Data providers-- any entity that gives access and distributes data to the public. To ensure the reliability of the published resources in the portal, the data providers of the portal are official representatives from supranational, national and local public administration.Data users-- any person or entity who accesses and consumes data for any purpose. These include a wide range of data users who visit the portal for different purposes: non-governmental organisations, international organisations, private sector, academia, students, etc.Data literacy-- the ability to read, understand, create, and communicate data as information. Much like literacy as a general concept, data literacy focuses on the competencies involved in working with data.The data providers (EU institutions, agencies and EU bodies, Member States, and other European countries) are autonomous in publishing their metadata (which gives you access to their data) in data.europa.eu. The portal also publishes datasets of organisations beyond the EU. The portal is being updated whenever new datasets and content are available.In addition to the vast collection of public datasets, most of them published in open formats, we offer additional contents and related services:training materials on open data in thedata.europa academystudies such asOpen Data MaturityorThe Economic Impact of Open Data;newsanddata storiesametadata quality dashboardassessing metadata quality against various findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) indicatorsalicencing assistantthe possibility of storing your data under certain conditions (pleasecontact us)the social media channels (X,LinkedIn,YouTube,Facebook)alist of eventswith the most relevant events taking placea monthlyNewsletterNew features for registered users will be added soon to data.europa.eu.The whole source code of the portal is available atGitLabfor free reuse.How to contribute to the portal:

It focuses on the implementation of EU open data and reuse policies under the legal acts adopted by the EU institutions. The Publications Office of the EU works on all four European open data space building blocks and their objectives:
- providing a comprehensive catalogue of open data and citizen-centric reuse services;
- improving the interlinking and interoperability of open data with other sources of public-sector information, such as legislation, publications and digital content;
- fostering the use of data from EU content through the organisation ofEU Datathoncompetitions and data visualisation events;
- contributing to the implementation of data governance and policies across the EU institutions.NextOur metadata model 2023 European CommissionMade withMaterial for MkDocsSkip to contentDocumentation of data.europa.eu (DEU)Publications and educationInitializing searchDocumentation of data.europa.eu (DEU)Who we areOur metadata modelHow to search for datasetsHow to publish on data.europa.euHow to publish on data.europa.euHow to publish on data.europa.euManual publicationData provider Interface (DPI) structure and functionPublication and editing via APIHow to be harvestedHow to request harvestingHarvesting guidelines for the European Register for Protected Data (ERPD) held by the Public SectorAPI DocumentationPublications and educationPublications and educationTable of contentsOpen data maturityData.europa academyNews and data storiesData storiesStudiesCalendarEU Open Data DaysEU DatathonNewsletterMetadata qualityData qualityData citationData visualisationAccessibility StatementGlossary of termsTable of contentsOpen data maturityData.europa academyNews and data storiesData storiesStudiesCalendarEU Open Data DaysEU DatathonNewsletterPublications and educationSeveral publications, ranging from the yearlyOpen Data Maturityreport to specificdata storiesandopen data newsare available through data.europa.eu.The portal offers social media coverage on open data topics, with the purpose of educating and informing citizens about the opportunities that using and reusing public data resources can bring.

The study forecasts the open data market size and employment growth for 2025. The impact is exemplified by efficiency gains and cost savings due to open data.Open data maturityThe study on open data maturity serves as benchmark to gain insights into the development of European countries in the field of open data. This annual assessment, started in 2015, presents the overview to better understand the countries level of maturity on open data. The study captures their progress over time and areas of improvement and benchmarks them against other countries. The report assesses the maturity against four dimensions:PolicyPortalImpactQualityIt also provides an overview of best practices implemented across Europe and a set of recommendations tailored to the level of maturity and characteristics of each group.

It comprisedEU DataViz, an international conference on open data and data visualisation, followed by the finals ofEU Datathon, the annual open data competition.The EU Open Data Days were designed to be relevant to all open data stakeholders and data users, with a special emphasis on the needs of the EUs public sector. The event attracted well over 2 000 registrations from data enthusiasts, data visualisation experts and solution-seekers. On the stage, different sectors of the society were represented, with more than 70 speakers coming from all around the world to bring their expertise for public administrations.The EU Open Data Days were organised by the Publications Office of the EU, with the active support of over 60 partners, representing the data providers from EU institutions and agencies, European national open data portals and national statistical offices, the key digital players in Luxembourg.You can access therecordings and presentationsonline.EU DatathonEU Datathon is an annual open data competition organised by the Publications Office of the EU since 2017. The competitions are organised to create new value for citizens through innovation and promote the use of open data available onthe portal.EU Datathons gather teams of people from all over Europe to stimulate innovation, creating a bridge between citizens and the EUs administration. As a result, new applications are developed to improve existing services or create completely new ones. The competitions have also demonstrated that potential users do need these initiatives for visibility purposes before potential business partners.Open data demonstrated in every edition how powerful it could be, in every sector of society. It showed us how it could help in the creation of start-ups, innovative products and services; it promotes transparency in the public sector, addresses current societal challenges, boosts economic growth and accelerates scientific progress.Every EU Datathon competition showed innovation when teams tackled different challenges, such as helping to achieve the digital single market (e.g.TenderlakeandC4P.io), making legislation more interoperable (e.g.The Smartfiles NetworkandLexparency), offering innovative technology relating to medicines (e.g.MedicatioandOpen Food Facts) or tackling climate change (ODCCI) through a platform which optimises irrigation to reduce water waste (e.g.Chloe irrigation system).These examples, among others, uncover how accessible and reusable data can help to build a better future.EU Datathons are organised in collaboration with partners in EU institutions and Member States to address domains of primary importance for citizens, the public sector and businesses: legislation, medications, food safety and public procurement, among others.
This interinstitutional collaboration highlights the common goals to be closer to citizens and support innovative start-ups. Additionally, by facilitating cooperation between public entities and the private sector, EU Datathons generate innovative ideas for open government, offering a platform for all sides to exchange information and learn.Moreover, it is a new, more direct way of interaction between citizens, innovative youth and the EU administration and it can generate a positive atmosphere around the Commission and the EU institutions in general.NewsletterTheportal newsletteris sent to subscribers monthly.
