The official portal for European data
The portal is a central point of access to European open data from international, European Union, national, regional, local and geodata portals. It consolidates the former EU Open Data Portal and the European Data Portal.


intended to:

give access and foster the reuse of European open data among citizens, business and organisations;

promote and support the release of more and better-quality metadata and data by the EU's institutions, agencies and other bodies, and European countries;

educate citizens and organisations about the opportunities that arise from the availability of open data.

Analytical reportsEurope2023  Report on Data Homogenisation for High-value Datasets
This report focuses on the European Unions open data policies, more specifically on Directive 2019/1024 (EU), also known as the open data directive, which defines the concept of high-value datasets (HVDs). An Implementing regulation that must be implemented by June 2024 lays down a list of specific high-value datasets in each of the six main categories identified in the directive: geospatial, Earth observation and environment, meteorological, statistics, company and company ownership, and mobility.
This study, proposes a methodological approach that facilitates the identification and homogenisation of HVDs, using selected examples of HVDs from three distinct categories. The insights of this report provide a roadmap for homogenising datasets across European countries and enhancing interoperability. (1.4 MB - PDF)

        A decade on: The evolution of open data maturity in Europe
      




            The data.europa.eu flagship publication has been documenting the open data landscape for ten years 
          




What makes 2024 a big year for the digital landscape in Europe? Maybe the,the first-ever legal framework on AI, or recent progress in thecomes to mind. All good suggestions  but there is more. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Open Data Maturity (ODM) assessment, our flagship publication that documents the year-on-year progress of European countries in making data openly accessible and stimulating its reuse.When it was first launched, ODM measured two dimensions of maturity in 31 countries. Today, it assesses maturity across the entire open data value chain using four dimensions: policy, portal, quality, and impact. And in 2023, 35 countries participated, covering the EU-27, three EFTA countries, and five candidate countries.Having established their open data policies, including transposing the into national law, and createdmodern portals to search for open data (see our recent features of and the), the found that countries are turning their attention to the quality of the metadata they provide to reusers.But the story is not over yet. The impact dimension remains an area for improvement. With increased efforts to achieve impact will be needed to monitor open data reuse and its effects on society. And, of course, the open data policy and technology landscape continues to evolve. In 2024, the implementing regulation on comes into force, setting additional requirements for certain categories of open data that can help turbocharge digital innovation in Europe.Over the past decade, the ODM report has aimed to support the development of open data best practices among participating countries and to provide an annual snapshot to its readers on the ever-evolving open data landscape in Europe. To keep abreast of this dynamic landscape, the ODM methodology will undergo a planned revision ahead of the 2024 exercise. This way, the assessment can continue to celebrate the achievements, highlight the challenges, and reflect on the opportunities ahead in Europes open data journey.Follow us on,, and, and subscribe to.

Today we celebrate, commemorating the anniversary of the , delivered by French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman in 1950. This historic declaration proposed a new form of political cooperation in Europe to prevent future wars among European nations, laying the foundation for the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, whose members agreed to pool coal and steel production. Fostering cooperation and economic integration, this eventually led to what we now know as the European Union, with peace and unity as its core principles.In commemoration of Europe Day 2024, the EU Open Day will be held in Brussels on Saturday 4 May, and a vast array of events and activities will take place in Brussels, Luxembourg, Strasbourg, and across the EU Member States. With the approaching in June, this year's EU Open Day provides a platform to explore how the European Union influences daily life and how individuals can contribute to its ongoing development.As we reflect on the historic significance of the 'Schuman Declaration' and celebrate Europe Day, it is essential to recognise the role of open data in shaping the EU's policies and initiatives. Open data promotes transparency, accessibility, and accountability within the EU institutions, enabling citizens to better understand the decision-making processes and outcomes.By embracing open data, individuals can actively participate in EU affairs, contributing to the promotion of peace, unity, and prosperity across Europe. Let us embrace the opportunities offered by events like the EU Open Day to engage with the EU's institutions and explore how open data can empower us to actively participate in shaping the future of Europe.For more news and events, follow us on,  and, or subscribeto.

By leveraging open datasets, journalists cananalyse vast amounts of information to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies, enabling data-driven reporting that enriches storytelling and enhances understanding. Furthermore, open data facilitates fact-checking efforts, allowing journalists to verify claims and ensure the accuracy of their reporting. This positive impact fosters greater transparency anddeepens understanding of critical issues, such as environmental challenges.Through platforms like, individuals can access reliable information on environmental degradation, climate change, and sustainable development efforts.

        Using open data to explore Belgiums priorities at the Council of the European Union 
      

        Open data reveals the EUs trajectory towards joint objectives 
      


The  is one of the three main institutions involved in . It comprises ministers from each EU Member State who negotiate and adopt legislative proposals together with the European Parliament. The Presidency of the Council rotates every 6 months. Following the end of the Spanish Presidency in December 2023, Belgium assumed the presidency from 1January to 30June 2024. Hungary will take over in July 2024. You can read more about the priorities of the Spanish Presidency in our previous .The presidencies of Belgium, Spain and Hungary collectively form a , jointly setting a common programme for an 18-month period. While the common programme serves as a foundational framework, individual countries retain the flexibility to establish individual priorities. The trio programme is focused on three policy areas: (1) enhancing the twin green and digital transitions; (2) prioritising fairness and inclusivity; and (3) strengthening international partnerships, security and trade policies while asserting EU values. The Belgian Presidency has outlined  for its semester. These echo continuity with the Spanish Presidency while also adding innovative approaches to the common objectives.Open data can provide insights into the different political priorities and facilitate tracking the progress towards joint EU objectives. This data story analyses the EU trend in three key priorities of the Belgian Presidency that exemplify the : (1) pursuing a green and just transition; (2) reinforcing the social and health agenda; and (3) promoting a global Europe.Pursuing a green and just transitionThe  is at the heart of the Belgian Presidencys programme. In line with the broader EU objectives of the , Belgium aims to enhance the EUs circular economy and the deployment of low-carbon energy sources. This focus echoes the Spanish Presidencys emphasis on the EUs .Open data is crucial in monitoring the energy transition and guiding the policymaking process. The , for instance, mandates a binding target of 42.5% renewable energy sources (RES) by 2030, a goal  as part of the ambitious  climate package aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels. But how are Member States progressing in reaching this target? According to data illustrated in Figure1 a chart showing RES progression the share of RES utilisation has more than doubled from 2005 to 2021, successfully meeting the 2020 target of 20% from the renewable energy directive. Extrapolating data linearly beyond 2021 suggests the EU is on track to reach 32% RES by 2030. However, this falls 10 percentage points short of the revised 2030 target, underscoring the need for accelerated efforts. This analysis, made possible through open data, highlights the crucial role of transparent, accessible information in evaluating progress and adjusting policies accordingly.It should be noted that relying solely on a linear projection to forecast RES growth does not take into account the dynamic impacts of increased economic initiatives, political will and technological advancements in the coming years. For example, several EU green initiatives and investments in new technologies could significantly accelerate the environmental transition. Open data will be instrumental in this context, not just for tracking progress towards the EU environmental objectives, but also for analysing the effectiveness of these initiatives and adjusting strategies accordingly.

NB:for 2022 (not included in the dataset) show a 22.5% share of renewable energy.Reinforcing our social and health agendaThe Belgian Presidency aims to , accelerate progress towards a more inclusive European society and ensure access to sustainable . This objective aligns with the Spanish Presidencys focus on fostering a more inclusive and fair society, highlighting the continuity across the trio presidency.Open data can be used to understand the economic perspective of social policies. Figure2 shows that the EUs expenditure on social protection as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is quite heterogeneous. Every country has its own national context and assigns social spending based on its requirements. Average EU expenditure on social protection between 2010 and 2021 ranged between approximately 15% and 35% of GDP. Eight Member States invested more than the EU average, which stood at around 28% for the selected period. The three Member States that spent the most on social protection were Denmark, France and the Netherlands. You can dive deeper into the  to explore how countries expenditures have changed over time and to which categories the expenditures are allocated.

Open data on EU international aid fosters transparency and enables us to track the distribution of disbursements. As the  of external aid, providing on average over EUR70billion annually, EU funding is directed worldwide to help tackle poverty and to advance global development. Figure3 shows an elaboration of the data available on the , a web tool providing easy access to data on the EUs aid around the world. From 2007 to the beginning of 2024, aside from aid in sectors not specified (flows that cannot be allocated to a specific sector, typically including core funding to multilateral organisations), the three categories that received the most fundingcumulatively around EUR 157 billionare refugees in non-sector allocable donor countries, material relief assistance and services, and higher education. Figure3 also shows that EU funding is diversified among numerous categories, addressing various needs in the recipient countries. You can continue to explore the  for additional insights.

Open data on renewable energy sources shows the progress made in achieving a net-zero society; open data on social protection helps us to easily track the financial perspective of the EUs social policies; and open data on humanitarian aid shows this important side of the EUs global role. Overall, open data is crucial to provide insights into and advise data-driven policymaking.Do you want to explore what open data can reveal about the Belgian Presidencys other priorities?

        The 2024 Open Data Maturity survey launches this month
      




            ODM is a tool for understanding the state of open data in Europe for policymakers and citizens
          




This month marks the launch of the 2024 Open Data Maturity (ODM) survey, in which countries from across Europe report on the latest developments in open data. Information for the report is collected directly from open data representatives in the participating countries to gather insights about the behind-the-scenes efforts that power the portals and datasets we can all see and use.The outcome of this exercise is both a quantitative benchmarking of open data maturity and a compendium of success stories, best practices, and challenges that countries can reference in their efforts to continuously improve in this field. The report is also a summary of the state-of-play of open data across Europe for all interested stakeholders.In a sense, the maturity assessment provides respondents with a comprehensive checklist of processes, standards, and activities across several themes that should be in place to achieve a mature open data ecosystem. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the ODM exercise and to retain its currency and fitness, the survey underwent a periodic update to include the latest developments in policy and technology. Nonetheless, its overall structure remains consistent to allow a year-on-year comparison of progress.In the coming weeks, a Q&A webinar is planned to explain the questionnaire and process to the nominated survey respondents. The survey will then be open for just over a month. After this, the data will be validated in consultation with the participating countries. Finally, the data will be analysed and summarised in the Open Data Maturity report, which will be published in December. In the meantime, catch up on the latest trends in open data by reading the , and stay tuned to data.europa.eu for the latest content in the lead-up to the 2024 ODM reports publication.For more news and events, follow us on, and, or subscribeto.

                              News & events          Linguistic Linked Data: open challenges and a roadmap













 




External event14 May 2024Online


Linked data (LD) has been identified as a key technology to realize the vision of a truly multilingual digital single market in Europe. Such a technology is in a mature state now and has been increasingly adopted by industry and public institutions worldwide (e.g., national libraries, museums, media companies, and public administrations, among others). In this context,linguistic linked data (LLD) appeared as an emergenttrend within the LD field to share and interlink linguistically relevant data sources. The benefits of sharing linguistic data on the Web in a semantically interoperable manner has been recognized by the language technologies community, which has shown increasing interest in publishing linguistic data and metadata as LLD on the Web. However, using such technologies comes at a price (in terms of learning curve, need of technical support, etc.) that has prevented their adoption and use on a larger scale.In this talk, they briefly review the current status of the LLD field and analyse some of their current challenges (related to sustainability issues, entry barriers to the technology, etc.). Then, a roadmap is proposed to address such challenges in order to attain an ecosystem of truly interoperable linguistic data on the Web, multilingual in nature, across different linguistic levels. Its potential role as a complementary technique to current large language models (LLM) will also be briefly discussed. Such a roadmap is one of the outcomes of NexusLinguarum, the "European network for Web-centred linguistic data science" COST Action".
