purpose: developing a European approach to Research Infrastructure policy as a key element of the emerging European Research Area (ERA).
ESFRI acts as the European knowledge hub on RI providing advice to governments on national, European and international investments in scientific facilities
vision: Equipping Europe with infrastructures for ground-breaking research

ESFRI is working on landscape analysis which provides an overview of the European RI ecosystem by identifying the main RIs operating transnational access in Europe. 
The Landscape Analysis will include RIs services, technology, instrumentation and data aspects, as well as societal and economic impact; it should cover national, European and global scales.
The ESFRI Landscape Analysis will be published online in December 2023.

The Forum
ESFRI, the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures, is a strategic instrument to develop the scientific integration of Europe and to strengthen its international outreach. The competitive and open access to high quality Research Infrastructures supports and benchmarks the quality of the activities of European scientists, and attracts the best researchers from around the world. 












The People
The ESFRI delegations are composed of two Delegates per Member State/Associate State, typically senior science policy officials or equivalent, representing the Minister(s) responsible for Research in each of those States. The Executive Board assists the Chair in the planning, preparation, implementation and continuous follow-up of ESFRI activities. 












The Working Groups
Since 2006, ESFRI has presented a series of Roadmap updates supporting a coherent and strategy-led approach to the development of pan-European Research Infrastructures. This has been possible by establishing the Strategy Working Groups in five research domains and the Implementation Group, transversal to all research areas. 





The StR-ESFRI project
The goal of the STR-ESFRI project is to reinforce the European STRategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) under the guidance of its Chair. StR-ESFRI provides additional resources, tools and expertise in performing its activities and supporting its structures.

The ForumESFRI, the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures, is a strategic instrument to develop the scientific integration of Europe and to strengthen its international outreach. The competitive and open access to high quality Research Infrastructures supports and benchmarks the quality of the activities of European scientists, and attracts the best researchers from around the world. ESFRI operates at the forefront of European and global science policy and contributes to its development translating political objectives into concrete advice for RI in Europe.





ESFRI Objectives & VisionThe mission of ESFRI is to support a coherent and strategy-led approach to policy-making on research infrastructures in Europe, and to facilitate multilateral initiatives leading to the better use and development of research infrastructures, at EU and international level. ESFRI's delegates are nominated by the Research Ministers of the Member and Associate Countries, and include a representative of the Commission, working together to develop a joint vision and a common strategy. 





ESFRI BackgroundThe European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures was established in 2002, with a mandate from the EU Council to support a coherent and strategy-led approach to policy-making on research infrastructures in Europe, and to facilitate multilateral initiatives leading to the better use and development of research infrastructures, at EU and international level. 





ESFRI StructureA brief overview of the composition and role of some of the key players in the Forum, ESFRI members, ESFRI executive Board and ESFRI executive secretariat. 





How ESFRI worksThe ESFRI is a self-regulated body, which operates openly and on a consensus basis. ESFRI Delegates are senior science-policy officials or equivalents, who represent ministers responsible for research in their country. A senior science-policy official represents the European Commission.

ESFRI Objectives & VisionThe mission of ESFRI is to support a coherent and strategy-led approach to policy-making on research infrastructures in Europe, and to facilitate multilateral initiatives leading to the better use and development of research infrastructures, at EU and international level. ESFRI's delegates are nominated by the Research Ministers of the Member and Associate Countries, and include a representative of the Commission, working together to develop a joint vision and a common strategy. This strategy aims at overcoming the limits due to fragmentation of individual policies and provides Europe with the most up-to-date Research Infrastructures, responding to the rapidly evolving Science frontiers, advancing also the knowledge-based technologies and their extended use.As the Europe 2020 strategy is implemented over the coming decade, research infrastructures will play an important role in stimulating innovation, solving our grand societal challenges, and impelling openness, excellence and collaboration. Thus, we have a vision for RIs in 2020. We call upon our leaders to act upon it. The ESFRI vision seeks to extend this capability to all research fields, driving innovation. It envisions all EU Member States working coherently and jointly together on RIs, to overcome existing limits. Our main objective is an open, competitive and level playing field for RIs, permitting access to all major facilities needed for cutting-edge research, advanced technologies and world-class education. This requires sustainable policies and funding, and that European resources be coordinated and pooled in the most effective way. In many cases the size, scope and cost of research infrastructures require multi-lateral or even global agreement; in these circumstances, the EU must be able to negotiate on an equal footing with international partners.This vision is feasible thanks to the development of strong trust and understanding between national policy. makers, working in ESFRI. This EU-level action will help make the best use of limited resources and show how science remains a basic tool for the construction and strengthening of Europe.Since its establishment in 2002, ESFRIs main objectives are: to support a coherent and strategy-led approach to policy making on research infrastructures in Europe; to facilitate multilateral initiatives leading to a better use and development of research infrastructures acting as an incubator for pan-European and global research infrastructures; to establish a European Roadmap for research infrastructures (new and major upgrades, pan-European interest) for the coming 10-20 years, stimulate the implementation of these facilities, and update the Roadmap as the need arises; to ensure the follow-up of implementation of already ongoing ESFRI projects after a comprehensive assessment, as well as the prioritisation of the infrastructure projects listed in the ESFRI Roadmap.ESFRI has also become an important point of reference for funding strategy for RI concerningnational and EU funding instruments. It contributes to the alignment of RI decision making atregional, national and global level  particularly with a view on smart specialisation strategiesand with national RI roadmap development.URL:

ESFRI BackgroundThe European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures was established in 2002, with a mandate from the EU Council to support a coherent and strategy-led approach to policy-making on research infrastructures in Europe, and to facilitate multilateral initiatives leading to the better use and development of research infrastructures, at EU and international level. In 2006, exactly ten years ago, ESFRI published its first roadmap for the construction and development of the next generation of pan-European research infrastructures. The roadmap was updated in 2008, 2010, 2016 and 2018, to include projects and landmarks that intend to foster European leadership across a broad range of scientific fields.Since it was formed in 2002 at the behest of the European Council, ESFRI has witnessed significant advances towards unity and international impact in the field of research infrastructures. The publication of the first Roadmap for pan-European research infrastructures in 2006, and its update in 2008 was a key contributing factor. A further update of the ESFRI Roadmap, focusing on Energy, Food and Biology, was published at the end of 2010.ESFRI has contributed to the creation of the European Charter for Access to ResearchInfrastructures and is committed to improve this reference document in the future.The Forum is determined to sustain the momentum in the implementation of the projects on the Roadmap, to expand the outreach to those scientific fields which are still evolving their conceptual approach in this direction, and to increase the involvement of all Countries by developing ad-hoc Regional policies.

How ESFRI works
The ESFRI is a self-regulated body, which operates openly and on a consensus basis. ESFRI Delegates are senior science-policy officials or equivalents, who represent ministers responsible for research in their country. A senior science-policy official represents the European Commission. The ESFRI Chair is appointed from among the ESFRI delegates, for a two-year non-renewable term. The ESFRI Executive Board assists the chair in planning ESFRI activities. This board is composed of the ESFRI Chair, the EC representative and of ESFRI Delegates selected by consensus.
The ESFRI Secretariat is provided by the European Commission. The secretariat's role is to assist the forum's operation. In particular, the secretariat assists the chair and executive board to prepare and circulate draft agendas, meeting summaries and related documents.The forum typically meets four times a year and adheres to a set of procedural guidelines, reviewed every two years. The forum may set up ad hoc working groups to analyse and report on topical issues.

By regularly carrying out analysis of RI landscapes in several reference scientific domains, in addition to e-infrastructures ESFRI captures and describes the key RI defining the entire landscape, identifies gaps and enables stakeholders at institutional, regional, national, European and global level to position their RI initiatives within a broader context and identifies synergies and complementarities with existing RI to refine their strategic priority setting.
ESFRI organises open calls for proposals, selects proposals based on strict eligibility criteria and reviews them in a clear and transparent manner through independent, international peer review thus contributing to a balance within the ERA between the bottom-up design of RI and the subsequent strategic top-down prioritisation of a limited portfolio of pan-European RI. ESFRI reports directly to the Council where the ministers have acknowledged ESFRI`s role and value.
ESFRI has developed and applies distinct and transparent evaluation, assessment, monitoring and periodic review mechanisms based on two independent processes, i.e. 1) the evaluation of the scientific case through the Strategy Workings Groups (SWG) and 2) the assessment of implementation through the Implementation Group (IG)  both processes being conducted in close cooperation with experts from the e-Infrastructure Reflections Group (e-IRG). In both cases, international and independent Reviewers are involved to provide advice, but ESFRI is solely and entirely responsible of the evaluation and assessment procedures and outcomes.
In addition to ESFRI, several European fora contribute to the discussion on RIs, such as the e-Infrastructure Reflection Group (e-IRG), EIROforum  the Association of European-Level Research Infrastructure Facilities (ERF). At international level there is the Group of Senior Officials on Global Research Infrastructures (GSO) and the Global Science Forum (GSF).

ESFRI Working Groups
Since 2006, ESFRI has presented a series of Roadmap updates supporting a coherent and strategy-led approach to the development of pan-European Research Infrastructures, which would ensure that scientists in Europe have access to world-class facilities enabling them to do cutting-edge research. This has been possible by establishing the Strategy Working Groups in six research domains and the Implementation Group, transversal to all research areas. In addition, in 2022 the Monitoring Committee was established as a permanent committee being responsible for coordinating the monitoring of ESFRI Landmark Research Infrastructures. 
A series of ad-hoc Working Groups periodically performed an in-depth analysis of the scientific aspects and the maturity features of the Research Infrastructures of ESFRI portfolio.

Strategy Working Group & Task ForcesESFRI STRATEGY WORKING GROUP ON ENERGY The Energy SWG monitors and assesses the implementation of existing Energy Research Infrastructures (RIs) and highlights and improves the potential energy applications in multi-disciplinary RIs. It will identify new important RIs and research demonstrators of pan-European interest in the Energy area, plan their implementation and examine the development of industrial prototypes in the Energy sector and their interactions with RIs and research demonstrators. Furthermore, it analyses new implementation schemes of RIs specific to the energy domain and fosters ESFRI collaborations with SET-Plan and other relevant EU initiatives (including upcoming European Innovation Partnerships).

Strategy Working Group & Task ForcesESFRI STRATEGY WORKING GROUP ON ENVIRONMENTThe Environment SWG follows up the scientific developments and initiatives in the field of the Environmental Sciences and formulates a strategy for Environmental RIs to support the objectives of the Innovation Union and ESFRI's Strategy report. It will identify new important RIs and research demonstrators of pan-European interest in the Environmental area, plan their implementation, as well as analyse best implementation schemes specific for the Environmental Sciences. It develops synergies between ESFRI research infrastructures in the field of Environmental Sciences and relevant Joint Programming Initiatives (JPI) and International Programs as GEO/GEOSS.

Strategy Working Group & Task ForcesESFRI STRATEGY WORKING GROUP ON DATA, COMPUTING & DIGITAL RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURESAs novel proposals with a dominant, or substantial, digital research infrastructure character have been proposed to the 2018 ESFRI Roadmap, ESFRI has established a Strategy Working Group on Data, Computing and Digital Research Infrastructures (SWG DIGIT) to deal with the evaluation of such proposals, therefore completing the set of SWGs for the identified areas of Research Infrastructures of the Roadmap.
The Strategy Working Group on Data, Computing and Digital Research Infrastructures has been chaired by Professor Ana Proykova since its establishment . Currently, the group consists of fifteen experts with a complementary expertise that covers the three thematic sub-fields. All experts were nominated by the ESFRI delegations and approved by the forum. The European Commission representatives in the DIGIT WG are actively involved in all activities.

Past Working GroupsADHOC WORKING GROUP ON NEUTRON LANDSCAPE GROUPThe Expert Group on Neutron Landscape  NLG  was mandated in 2014 by the Physical Sciences & Engineering Strategy Work Group, to develop a thorough analysis of the European Landscape of Research Infrastructures devoted to Neutron Scattering, and its evolution in the next decades.
ESFRI felt the urgency of such analysis, since many reactorbased neutron sources will be closed down in the next years due to national decisions, while the European Spallation Source  ESS  in Lund will be fully operative only in the mid or late 2020s. It was necessary to analyse at the appropriate level the implications in terms of capacity and capability of neutron science in Europe, both during the crossover period of national reactors with the ESS, and in the longer term. This rationale led ESFRI to create the Neutron Landscape Group  NLG, co-chaired by Prof. Colin Carlile, former Director General of the ILL and of the ESS, and Prof. Caterina Petrillo, now Vice-Chair of the ESS Council.

Strategy Working Group & Task ForcesESFRI MONITORING COMMITTEE
The Monitoring Committee is a permanent working group.
Since 2016, the ESFRI Roadmap has listed ESFRI Landmarks as reference RIs. They are pillars in the ERA landscape, offering not only services to academic research but also supporting development and innovation. Guaranteeing the excellence of the Landmark label, ESFRI has the responsibility for monitoring the quality of the RIs listed in the ESFRI roadmap as Landmarks. For this purpose, ESFRI has developed and implemented a methodology for monitoring Landmarks.
The Monitoring Committee is responsible for overseeing the monitoring process on behalf of ESFRI. It coordinates the implementation of the monitoring framework. The group shall also develop and adapt the monitoring methodology.

Strategy Working Group & Task ForcesESFRI-EOSC Coordination Task ForceThe  and the  have both recognised a key role of ESFRI and thematic RIs working together with EOSC core developers and operators to speed up the implementation of open science policy and the FAIR data management and to promote interdisciplinary R&I in Europe and considered that coordination between ESFRI and the EOSC Steering Board is needed. 
The ESFRI-EOSC Task Force has been approved by ESFRI and the EOSC Steering Board and the first meeting took place on 12 June 2023. The Task Force members are Volker Beckmann (appointed as chair of the task force for the first semester) and Giorgio Rossi from the EOSC-SB, Elena Hoffert and Jan Hruk from ESFRI, and Javier Lopez Albacete and Martyn Chamberlain from the EC. Observers from the ERIC Forum, the EIRO forum, the EOSC Association, the e-IRG and on a rotational 6-month basis, one representative of European RI networks registered to the  will be invited to attend subsequent meetings. The Task Force will be established for the duration of the current ERA Policy Agenda (until end of 2024) with the possibility for renewal.

The general objective of the ESFRI-EOSC Task Force is to ensure a structured interface between the ESFRI Forum and the EOSC Steering Board beyond the current ad-hoc cooperation. Key drivers for the Task Force are to align collective interests and maximise the impact of efforts towards enabling an integrated ecosystem of Research Infrastructures that would feed into a dynamic EOSC federation as a key contribution to a web of FAIR data and services for science.More specifically, the main objectives of the ESFRI-EOSC Task Force include:

Objective 1: Help reduce the fragmentation of the research data landscape in Europe by stimulating the connection ofESFRI RIs and ERICs to the EOSC federation
The Task Force should take into account the requirements of RIs as key stakeholders in EOSC and maximise their impact on EOSC.

Raise awareness about the upcoming deployment of the EOSC EU node among RIs, including technical and governance aspects, and stimulate the connection of RIs to the EOSC federation. The task force could ensure there is a user-friendly and comprehensive catalogue of available EOSC services, as well as corresponding use cases, success stories, and demonstrations, that clearly highlight the benefits of EOSC and potential impacts towards a culture of Open Science.

Contribute to highlight the added value of EOSC for RIs in terms of economy of scale for provision of services to RIs and any other cross-cutting elements for an efficient and sustainable research and innovation system.
Objective 2: Assist in increasing FAIR research data productivity in Europe
High-quality data needs to populate EOSC for it to work well. It is the RIs that already have some good practices able to come up with such high-quality data. RI facilities and their users have a process of quality assessment.

Identification of i) good practices at the policy and implementation levels from RIs ii) major obstacles (technical, organisational, sociological, etc.) for the broader uptake of FAIR data management practices at RIs.
To assess the readiness of RIs for the generation of machine actionable FAIR data sets and to examine the prospects for AI/ML data analysis enabled by the EOSC.
Liaison with the EOSC-SB policy subgroup currently working on recommendations for improved FAIR data productivity in Europe, by bringing in the end-user perspective from research infrastructures.
To formulate policy recommendations for research funding organisations in order to support and stimulate the broader adoption of FAIR data management in the context of EOSC, and to ensure that disciplines and thematic areas that may be less advanced on this aspect also connect to and benefit from the EOSC federation.
To facilitate the coordination of ESFRI-EOSC support to skills development for data stewards and specific training of RI staff, including through (existing or planned) Competence Centres.

Past Working GroupsESFRI WORKING GROUP ON INNOVATIONThe Working Group on Innovation  INNO WG  was set-up in 2013 in order to propose to the Forum the broad lines of a strategic plan for an industry-oriented cooperation of the Research Infrastructures to contribute to the implementation of the ESFRIs Strategy and Roadmap 2016.
It follows the Conclusions of the Council of the European Union of 31st May 2011 that INVITES the European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) to contribute towards supporting the implementation and monitoring of progress of the Innovation Union initiative, and provide input, as appropriate, to the development of a proposal on the ERA Framework5 .
The objectives that have been recognized by the Forum can be summarized as follows:

to identify and promote the innovation and industrial capabilities of the RIs on the ESFRI Roadmap;
to strengthen the cooperation of pan-European RIs with industry;
to stimulate, where appropriate, the industrial involvement in the conceptual design phase of RIs;
to promote the access of industrial users to the RIs.

Equipping Europe with infrastructures for ground-breaking research
ESFRI's response to the new challenges lying ahead for Europe





















 






Message from the ESFRI's Chair, Jan Hruk

Our vision is an ecosystem of excellent Research Infrastructures broadly enabling ground-breaking research. An advanced and integrated system of Research Infrastructures provides crucial services for researchers and innovators, thus enabling the generation of scientific knowledge underpinning our capacity to respond to major societal challenges.





  

 




Message from the EU Commissioner, Mariya Gabriel

I believe this White Paper will further strengthen Europes capacity to develop science based solutions that will help tackle global challenges and directly benefit European citizens. Europes research infrastructures have been key to the way we have been able to pool our resources in our response to the coronavirus. Lets work together to make sure that we continue to produce some of the best science in the world.





  



 






Executive Summary & main policy messages
European Research Infrastructures are a key pillar of the European Research Area (ERA) and one of its most successful achievements to date. This Document is the input of ESFRI to the ongoing discussion of a renewed ERA.
Over the last 18 years, within the framework of ESFRI and the ESFRI Roadmap process, national governments have worked in close partnership with the European Commission and the scientific community to catalyse the establishment of over 50 European Research Infrastructures, mobilising investments of approximately 20 billion across the EU.




























Making Science Happen
ESFRI reflects on almost twenty years of successful existence and sets out its future development











Main Objectives for European RIs in the new ERA 














 


Education: engage Research Infrastructures and Higher Education institutions in specialized training of students, young academics and industrial scientists on next-generation technologies, inter-disciplinary methodologies and data management skills




  

 


Innovation: accelerate the exploitation of European Research Infrastructures as knowledge and innovation hubs, boosting their role as drivers of economic growth, social and environmental transitions, and place-based innovation




  

 


Ecosystem: consolidate the existing Research Infrastructure landscape and continuously strengthen its capacity through investments in unique, cutting-edge scientific instrumentation and services, and working jointly to serve researchers needs across disciplines




  

 


Research: maintain an absolute edge globally in Research Infrastructure capabilities to serve ambitious, curiosity- and demand-driven, societally relevant, scientific and technological research, thereby increasing the attractiveness of the ERA for researchers, industrial users and international partners




  

 


Policies: increase coherence between European, national and regional priorities and policies for Research Infrastructure development and funding, and effective synergies with other European policies and funding instruments




  

 


Data: exploit the data science and data engineering expertise of Research Infrastructures for the development of the European Open Science Cloud

ESFRI Workplan 2022-2023

n November 2021, the Competitiveness Council endorsed the Council recommendation and a Pact on Research and Innovation wasadopted, which contains 10-year priorities to deliver on European Research Area. These long-ranging priorities were addressed in the ERA Policy Agenda, which lays out the three-year actions, to progress towards the priorities of the Pact. Of particular relevance is Action 8 of the ERA policy agenda, which is dedicated to Research Infrastructures. Further indications regarding the activities of ESFRI were provided by the Competitiveness Council in its.
The ESFRI Workplan for 2022-2023 primarily focuses on the implementation of the activities entrusted to ESFRI by the aforementioned Council Conclusions and Action 8. To this end, dedicated ESFRI expert groups were established to implement the different mandates and propose relevant action plans for ESFRI and the broader RI community. Areas of work include improved access to RIs, RI funding for sustainability, the energy crisis, RI impact assessment, RI cooperation with industry and Technology Infrastructures, international cooperation, , the  framework implementation, increased transparency of ESFRI, improved Stakeholder engagement, and more.
Described below are the ongoing activities of the current ESFRI Drafting Groups and other expert groups, aligned with the implementation of the ambitious ESFRI Workplan.














The recent pandemic and energy crises, along with rapid digital developments, have drastically changed the conditions for accessing Research Infrastructures (RIs). Despite the continued EU and national support that facilitated transnational and virtual access to RIs for many researchers, there are still challenges hindering broader and more sustainable access to European RIs and their services. To address these challenges, the ESFRI Drafting Group on Access to RIs is conducting a comprehensive analysis of RI access, considering various modes of access and their key dimensions (such as technology, data, and legal issues Their goal is to find ways to overcome these challenges and potentially revise or add elements to the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures. In this work in progress, the Drafting Group utilizes political statements and policy documents reflecting the EU R&I ecosystem positions on access to RIs as valuable input to inform their action plan.

European RIs are a key component of the European Research Area (ERA) and ESFRI has played a a crucial role in their strategic planning. As of 2021, 63 RIs are listed on the ESFRI Roadmap, made possible through national and regional investments, catalysed by EU funding.To ensure their long-term sustainability and further development, a coordinated and multi-level European effort should be implemented, with funding as a critical aspect to examine. To this aim, ESFRI has established a Drafting Group to analyse funding practices and prepare recommendations. The Group's focus is two-fold: to identify national and EU funding practices, including multi-level funding synergies, as well as bottlenecks and opportunities, and provide ESFRI recommendations; to provide future insights in the scientific and funding needs of RIs, in order to identify opportunities for additional financial support to RIs at the European level (i.e. for transnational access, digitalisation, alignment with national and European policy goals, etc).

RIs have become increasingly important in all fields of research, providing essential resources for scientific innovation and improvement. Founded when traditional funding mechanisms are insufficient, RIs are often collaborative efforts between multiple countries, research institutions, and researchers, and require large investments. As funders and policymakers are interested in the performance and impact of RIs, a dedicated ESFRI Drafting Groupwas created to work on providing definitions and guidelines for assessing investments in RIs, from an ESFRI perspective. Itswork is focused on examining the relevance and importance of impact assessment for RIs and builds upon the work conducted within ESFRI on the Monitoring of RIs Performance, ultimately aiming to outline guidelines for assessing the impact of ESFRI landmarks and projects, and non-ESFRI RIs, beyond the core functioning and performance, to gain a better understanding of their broader impact on science, society, and the economy.

ESFRI has relied on its members, the ESFRI Secretariat and the relevant EC Units, to communicate its activities and outputs, making it a well-recognized body in the European research and innovation community. To build upon the existing tools and activities, a Drafting Group has been created to develop a high-level communication and outreach strategy that will be aligned to the ESFRI Workplan and effectively communicate that the Forum has entered a new period of its lifecycle, where transparency and engagement with the RI and R&I community are key. The Group works to design carefully customized approaches to meet the complex communication needs of the diverse ESFRI stakeholder community, put in place internal communication processes and strengthen two-way communication channels. Looking beyond the RI community, the communication strategy will seek new avenuesto establish links to civil society and the public, engage industry and make ESFRI messages visible to public authorities.

ESFRI has included the Landscape Analysis in its Roadmaps since 2016 to provide an overview of the European RI ecosystem, by identifying prominent RIs offering transnational access across all research fields, new and ongoing projects, and the global landscape of relevance. The LA has evolved over time, becoming a more comprehensive and strategic document that includes trend analysis and examples of RI services and their impacts in specific areas (2018 and 2021 updates). ESFRI has since decided to de-couple the  process from the Roadmap, and in 2023, the Forum will publish a more strategic Landscape Analysis report, as part of ERA Action 8, to provide the framework for the next ESFRI Roadmap and contribute to the EOSC Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda. To this aim, the Landscape Analysis Drafting Group works on a comprehensive analysis of the European RI landscape to identify existing synergies, persistent deficiencies, and proposed improvements for accessibility, networking, and integration of RIs. The report will include services, technology, data, and impact across national, European, and global scales and will involve RIs and RI stakeholders a source for relevant information.

ESFRI Landmarks were introduced in the ESFRI Roadmap 2016 as reference RIs and are pillars in the ERA landscape offering not only services to academic research, but also supporting development and innovation. Guaranteeing the excellence of the Landmark label, ESFRI has responsibility for monitoring the quality of the RIs listed in the ESFRI Roadmap as Landmarks. Since 2018, an ESFRI Working Group and an Implementation Group have worked on the Landmark monitoring exercise, producing reports with assessment criteria and a proposed methodology for the monitoring of Landmarks on the ESFRI Roadmap. The  process, started in 2022 and coordinated by the ESFRI Monitoring Committee, will cover Landmarks which have already started their operational phase and actively provide services. Monitoring will be based on qualitative information gathered through a questionnaire and quantitative information represented by KPIs, complemented by hearings and site visits. The outcomes of the Landmark monitoring exercise will provide insights into the functioning of the European RI ecosystem as a whole and will contribute to the identification of gaps in the European landscape and future opportunities for the RIs in Europe.

This activity will foster the engagement of RIs and their umbrella organisations with the broad range of research and innovation stakeholders including user organisations and broader scientific communities, organisations and networks of research performing organisations, actors in the innovation ecosystem, stakeholders from business communities as well as national and regional authorities and funding bodies. A key element of this action will be the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive ESFRI strategy for stakeholder engagement. This will include, among others, the ESFRI Stakeholder Forum, development of its activities together with stakeholders and their consequent implementation.
The activity will seize opportunities from ESFRI and the EOSC tripartite governance to expand and accelerate cooperation among generic and thematic infrastructures across the institutional, national, regional, and European levels and a further engagement with stakeholders and international partners. It will also strengthen the impact of European research infrastructures and the EOSC on the long tail of science, opening up data and digital services to all European researchers.

The Russian aggression on Ukraine, in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic aftermath, has wide-ranging consequences for the EU, including an immense energy cost increase, and a shortage of critical resources. Both of these have pronounced effects on the sustainability and operations of RIs several of which face difficulties in providing continuous service. To collect information about the challenges and possible ways of addressing them, a dedicated drafting group looks into the present challenges and their extent, as well as the policy responses from ESFRI members. The outcomes will enable ESFRI members to discuss ways to increase sustainability of RIs and their services, and elaborate scenarios to manage possible upcoming crises, including energy supply difficulties.

The main objective of the work is to elaborate the ESFRIs approach to international cooperation, linking the European, national and regional RIs in a multi-disciplinary and cross-sectorial way with the macro-regional and global levels. To this end, the political priorities of the EUs external relations in the field of research and innovation will be examined through the lens of RI policy and RIs. The main global macro-regional actors to engage with will be identified, and the policy cooperation mechanisms will be examined, in order to deliver on the indications of the Competitiveness Council - cooperation with 3rd countries on a case-by-case approach based on shared fundamental values and principles.

The relationship between Research Infrastructures (RIs) and industry is well understood and has been in existence for many years. The ambition of the drafting group is to get an even better understanding of the collaborative relationships between RIs and industry to identify the areas where RIs need further support to collaborate effectively with industry, and where industry could benefit more from RIs. In view of the on-going discussion on Action 12 of the new ERA, the group will also aim to identify a better understanding of the roles that both Research and Technology Infrastructures (TIs) will play going forward and, more importantly, how they can both complement one another and contribute to a coherent landscape of infrastructures to support Europes science base in development of effective solutions to pressing socio-economic challenges.

A distributed RI consists of a Central Hub and interlinked National Nodes and needs to:- have a unique specific name and legal status and governance structure with clear responsibilities and reporting lines, including international supervisory and appropriate external advisory bodies; - have legally binding attributions of coordination competences and resources to the Central Hub;- have a common access policy9 and provide for a single point of access for all users with a support structure dedicated to optimise the access for the proposed research; - have a user programme designed to absorb a considerable part of the total capacity of the RI;- identify and agree upon relevant and measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPI) addressing both excellence of scientific services and sustainability of operation;- have a human resources policy adequate to warrant the necessary competences for the effective operation of the Central Hub and to support the users programme, and to encompass hiring, equal opportunities, secondments, education and training;- define a joint investment strategy aimed at strengthening the RI through the Nodes and common/shared facilities. 










The ESFRI Landmarks are the RIs that were implemented or started implementation under the ESFRI Roadmap and are now established as major elements of competitiveness of the European Research Area. The ESFRI Landmarks need continuous support for successful completion, operation and upgrade in line with the optimal management and maximum return on investment.











ESFRI-MOS is the central online platform for information on the ESFRI Projects and ESFRI Landmarks. The overall objective is to provide efficient knowledge management for supporting political decision making and public awareness on the ESFRI Research Infrastructures.











The ESFRI Projects have been selected for scientific excellence and maturity and are included in the Roadmap in order to underline their strategic importance for the European Research Infrastructure system and support their timely implementation. The ESFRI Projects can be at different stages of their preparation according to the date of inclusion in the ESFRI Roadmap.











The ESFRI has a key role in policy-making on research infrastructures in Europe. In particular the ESFRI contributes to the development of a strategic roadmap that identifies vital new European RIs for the next 10-20 years. In 2006, exactly ten years ago, ESFRI published its first roadmap for the construction and development of the next generation of pan-European research infrastructures. The roadmap was updated in 2008, 2010, 2016 and 2018, to include projects and landmarks that intend to foster European leadership across a broad range of scientific fields.











A series of exchange of experience (EoE) workshops to promote mutual learning and identify best practices, facilitating their adoption among managers of research infrastructures and stakeholder networks. The Workshops are organized by StR-ESFRI. 










The GSO has defined GRI upon mandate by the G8+510 and recognises the vital role of GRI in addressing worldwide science and technology challenges and the benefits of coordinating investments in GRI to efficiently use the available resources and fully realise their potential benefits. GRI may be single-site or distributed RI and should follow the GSO Framework for Global Research Infrastructures10 approved by the GSO in 2014. The GSO updated a list11 of potential GRI is continuously offering opportunities for matchmaking exercises. The GSO members can propose GRI candidates seeking for international partnership. GSO members, including the EC, can propose an ESFRI RI as potential GRI. 










The Landscape Analysis identifies the main RIs operating open access in Europe, in all field, and major new or ongoing projects. This includes national, regional and international facilities as well as consortia that offer integrated services and transnational access to state-of-the-art resources for research. The Landscape Analysis is a reference document for information and does not represent in any way a prioritization of ESFRI for future investments or the view or any commitment on the part of ESFRI members.











A major upgrade is an upgrade to an operational RI with the goal of delivering a transformative effect to its scientific outputs, or a substantial change of technical approach and does not mean routine maintenance or incremental gains. To that end, any applications to the Roadmap, which come under the category of upgrade, will be required to include robust justification describing the degree of upgrade. An existing RI planning a major upgrade can submit a proposal to become a Project. 










The following definition for RI from Article 2 (6) of the Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of 11 December 2013: `Establishing Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014- 2020)` applies: RI are facilities, resources and services that are used by the research communities to conduct research and foster innovation in their fields. They include: major scientific equipment (or sets of instruments), knowledge-based resources such as collections, archives and scientific data, einfrastructures, such as data and computing systems and communication networks and any other tools that are essential to achieve excellence in research and innovation. Accordingly, RI are implemented along different organisational models, including central sources and laboratories for experiments and measurement sessions, coordination and management of geographically distributed observatories or laboratories, remotely accessible resources for computing, data banks, physical sample repositories, surveys and longitudinal studies. 










A single-site RI is a geographically localised central facility designed for user access whose governance - in the case of ESFRI - is European or international. A single-site RI needs to: - have a legal status and governance structure with clear responsibilities and reporting lines, including international supervisory and relevant external advisory bodies; - have an access policy8 and access point for external users facilitating the submission of proposals through a user programme designed to absorb a considerable part of the total capacity of the RI; - have a user support structure in place to optimise access, such as users office space, ancillary laboratories, accommodation arrangements and logistics; - have a data management system allowing for easy storage, retrieval of data and on-line/insitu/remote data reduction and analysis; - identify and agree upon relevant and measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPI) addressing both excellence of scientific services and sustainability issues; - demonstrate a human resources policy to gather the necessary competences for its operation, hiring, equal opportunities, education and training. 










Since 2006, ESFRI has presented a series of Roadmap updates supporting a coherent and strategy-led approach to the development of pan-European Research Infrastructures, which would ensure that scientists in Europe have access to worldclass facilities enabling them to do cutting-edge research. This has been possible by establishing the Strategy Working Groups in five research domains and the Implementation Group, transversal to all research areas. These permanent Working Groups periodically performed an in-depth analysis of the scientific aspects and the maturity features of the Research Infrastructures of ESFRI portfolio. The Strategy Working Groups are the ESFRI instruments to analyse the scientific aspects of Research Infrastructures in a given field of research.

The key objective of StR-ESFRI3 is to provide high-quality and flexible support to ESFRI, in achieving its goals based on the White Paper 2020 strategy, increasing its visibility, operational and analytical capacity, along with its impact on developing a consistent and dynamic European Research Area (ERA) policy for Research Infrastructures.

The project builds on the experience of the previous ESFRI support projects, having successfully supported ESFRI in the realisation of a series of ESFRI Roadmaps (2016, 2018, 2021) and corresponding Landscape analyses, of the ESFRI White Paper 2020 "Making Science Happen", and of a series of related communication actions and events, including workshops for the Exchange of Experiences (EoE) among RIs and for the interconnection of RIs in EOSC.

StR-ESFRI3 aims at reviewing and enhancing its current support activities in the areas of the ESFRI Roadmap process and the Landscape Analysis, the RI monitoring and the MoS platform, and in the area of EOSC, liaising with the EOSC Association with emphasis on researcher engagement and RI federation in EOSC. Furthermore, StR-ESFRI3 aims at expanding its activities to new areas, in particular to support ESFRI in its European Research Area (ERA)-related activities including the upcoming ERA Policy Agenda, where RIs is one of its key actions. This is also linked with the development of a sustainable support structure (ESFRI Office), for which an analysis of possible scenarios for related support structures (including the creation of a legal entity) will be performed, with the support of external contractors.

The project will support ESFRI during a 4 year period (2022-2025). The consortium builds on the experience and expertise of the partners in previous StR-ESFRI projects (Athena RC, HIPC and UMIL), incorporating the support institute of the newly elected Chair (UL) for 2022-2023, while dedicated budget has been also planned for next Chair for 2024-2025 (within the coordinator's budget).

StR-ESFRI3 Partners
The StR-ESFRI2 Project is led by the Athena Research Center (Greece) and the project members include experienced entities from Italy, Slovenia and the Czech Republic with strong involvement in ESFRI and its activities.

 
The scope of activities of Athena RC includes all Information and Communication Technologies, from the perspective of both Computer Science and Computational Sciences, and covering all software and hardware aspects. These include all areas of informatics, data science, robotics, automation, signal processing, artificial intelligence, networking and digital communication, and modelling. Athena RC carries out R&D both at the level of information technology itself and the level of specific applications. Computational sciences thus form a strong component of the Athena RC activities, including - but not limited to - computational linguistics, archaeology, engineering, medicine, biology, biodiversity, earth observation, space science, mechanics, and the arts. Athena RC is recognized for its extensive experience and unique skills offered through its more than 300 researchers, associated faculty, collaborating scientists, and professional staff. By participating in more than 200 national and European projects in the last 5 years and producing more than 1000 publications in the same time frame, the people of Athena RC may be credited with its strong international reputation.
Athena RC operates in three Greek cities (Athens, Patras, and Xanthi) and comprises three Institutes and five Units:

Institutes: The Institute for Language and Speech Processing (ILSP), The Industrial Systems Institute (ISI), and The Information Management Systems Institute (IMSI)
Units: the Corallia Technology Cluster Initiative, the Space Programmes Unit (SPU), the Robot Perception and Interaction Unit (RPI), the Environmental and Networking Technologies and Applications Unit (ENTA), and the PharmaInformatics Unit.


 
The University of Milan is a public teaching and research-intensive university, the only Italian among the 23 members of LERU (League of European Research Universities), and an internationally high-ranked university. Research activities are conducted in 32 Departments and 22 Inter-departmental Research Centres, with more than 24.000 scientific publications in the last three years, 222 patent family and 24 active spin-offs.
The Universitys researchers occupy leading positions in numerous research programmes conducted both at a national and international level. U programmes represent a major source of funding for the University of Milan, which has signed 147 grants under the 7th Framework Programme (2007-2013), for a total value of  50.344.153, and 70 grants up to December 2017 under the Horizon 2020 Programme, for a total value of more than  19.000.000. The Department of Physics hosts research activities in various domains of fundamental and applied Physics. The Department employs 49 professors, 34 researchers and 32 administrative and technical staff units. Several Italian and foreign students of the PhD School and Post-Docs contribute to the research activities of the Department.


         
University of Ljubljana (UL) is the oldest, largest, and internationally best-ranked university in Slovenia, being among the top 500 universities according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities Shanghai ranking (ARWU). Researchers from the Faculty of Social Sciences (FSS) will participate in the project. FSS is one of the largest members of the University of Ljubljana. It provides educational and research activities across a broad range of fields, including sociology, political sciences, communications, cultural sciences, international relations, European studies, and many other disciplines. FSS has its own research unit  the Institute of Social Sciences (ISS). ISS is composed of 20 active research centres and Social Sciences Data Archives that conduct basic and applied research in social sciences. UL is thus bringing together the necessary disciplinary and inter-disciplinary knowledge, with emphasis on social sciences and humanities.



The Institute is a centre of fundamental research in physical chemistry, and chemical physics. The research work is characterized by many cross-links both within the Institute and also with other institutions in Europe, the USA, Japan and other parts of the world. Much of the scientific work is concerned with fundamental research, in both experiment and theory, but several groups, in particular in catalysis and electrochemistry, are also making contributions in more applied aspects. The institute comprises laboratories with complete infrastructure for catalysis, electrochemistry, ion chemistry and analytical research. The Institute is operating the national research infrastructure NanoEnviCZ and serving as platform for the Center for innovation in the field of Nanomaterials and Nanotechnologies. In top of these facilities HIPC is running several computational clusters (c. 34.000 cores), which are fully equipped for large scale quantum chemical calculations. A staffed library, full IT infrastructure, new modern conference centre and a project support office are available at HPC and are complementing the research facilities. Besides the research activities the Institute is strongly involved in training of both undergraduate and graduate students, supervising their diploma and Ph.D. theses, and in teaching at universities in Czech Republic and abroad.
HIPC is active in EU funded research Framework programs. It is running several FP7 and H2020 projects (including the prestigious ERA-Chair project), it has participated in several ITN projects (some coordinated) and other MSC actions, and it took part also in COST, Euratom projects. The present institute staff consists of about 165 full-time employees and approximately 45 graduate students.

Welcome to the 
ESFRI MoS is the central online platform for information on ESFRI Projects and Landmarks. It is based on data from the ESFRI Roadmap 2018 and will include updated information for the ESFRI Roadmap 2021.
It has been developed as a service by the StR-ESFRI2 Project to provide crucial guide and support for dedicated workflows of ESFRI and its working groups during the roadmapping update processes, and to offer general information on ESFRI Research Infrastructures to the public.
The modular design of ESFRI MoS includes:

a workflow system for submission and evaluation of new proposals for Research Infrastructures to enter the ESFRI Roadmap
a workflow system for the monitoring of ESFRI Research Infrastructures
a repository for viewing, editing, adding, and querying basic data and statistics on ESFRI Research Infrastructures

The objectives of ESFRI-MOS are:

to support key target groups in their periodical selection / monitoring / update process towards decision making on ESFRI Research Infrastructures
to develop a user-friendly and user-targeted system that is scalable both in terms of additional information dimensions within the system and in connection with other systems as well as in terms of further modular functions

The overall goal of ESFRI MoS is to provide efficient knowledge management for supporting political decision making and public awareness on Research Infrastructures.

THIS IS AN ARCHIVAL PAGE - NOT VALID FOR ANY ROADMAP UPDATE OTHER THAN 2021

It is with great pleasure that ESFRI announces the launch of the Roadmap 2021 Update.fter a two-year-long process of hard and meticulous work by a great number of scientists and ESFRI delegates, a new ESFRI Roadmap is to be published. On December 7th, 2021, ESFRI will present the 2021 ESFRI Roadmap on Large Scale Research Infrastructures during a half-day online conference that will be live streamed. For more information,please visit theESFRI .

TheESFRI Roadmapcontains probably the best European science facilities based on a thorough evaluation and selection procedure. It combinesESFRI Projects, which are new research infrastructures in progress towards implementation, andESFRI Landmarks, successfully implemented Research Infrastructures. The document also describes the broader Landscape of research in Europe which is an important component toESFRI methodology.


The ESFRI Roadmap 2021 will include 11 new Research Infrastructure Projects and report on the development of research infrastructures under the existing Roadmap. All previous ESFRI Roadmap updates proved to be very influential and provided useful strategic guidance for European Countries investments, which goes beyond the research infrastructure domain. The 2021 update also considers the merits of the Open science concept and highlights the quest to address global challenges, as reflected in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. One of the key aspects of ESFRI rests in ensuring that excellent scientists have access to Europes best Research Infrastructures, irrespective of borders. This requires truly pan-European collaboration and a global outlook. In this process ESFRI has acquired immense and valuable experience; it is our privilege to be able to share this experience across countries and research infrastructure projects.

BACKGROUND
Since 2016 ESFRI has introduced in its Roadmaps the Landscape Analysis which provides an overview of the European RI ecosystem by identifying the main RIs operating transnational access in Europe, in all fields of research, and major new or ongoing projects, as well as an outlook to the global landscape of relevance. The Landscape Analysis has progressively (2018, 2021) evolved towards a more complete and strategic document including trend analysis and the first examples of RIs services and their impacts in specific areas.
In order to underline the strategic relevance of the Landscape Analysis, ESFRI has decided to de-couple the LA from the Roadmap. According to the new ERA Action 8, ESFRI will publish a more strategic LA report in 2023, which must provide the framework for the next ESFRI Roadmap, contribute to the EOSC Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, and promote the development of new research infrastructure services, including, when needed, infrastructure clustering for pan-European thematic or interdisciplinary services.
Competitiveness Council in its conclusions furthermore invited ESFRI to perform a comprehensive analysis of the European RI landscape with the aim to identify existing synergies and complementarities, expose persistent deficiencies, shortcomings and gaps, and propose improvements on accessibility, networking, clustering, associating and even merging of European, national and regional RIs, and their deeper integration in a fully functional and interoperable European RI ecosystem. It furthermore emphasised the critical importance of RIs in achieving the objectives of European Missions and of ESFRI in guiding the strategic development of the European RI landscape and fostering RIs contribution to the implementation of European Missions.
To reach this level of ambition, the Landscape Analysis will provide a more consolidated gap analysis based on user needs. It should cover the different domains and multiple dimensions across the domains and also include the evolution of needs to identify priorities for future developments.
The Landscape Analysis will include RIs services, technology, instrumentation and data aspects, as well as societal and economic impact; it should cover national, European and global scales.
To prepare such an ambitious report, ESFRI has decided to involve directly the RIs and main stakeholders which could provide the relevant information for this report. RIs were kindly asked to fill in a relevantquestionnaire, where information about the current status, trends and future developments,as well asimpact, wascollected.RIs Clusters were invited to fill in another questionnairewhere they provided specific information related to the specific domain. Relevant stakeholders wereinvited to provide their strategic insights.

Monitoring of ESFRI Landmarks












 













 




The first round of the Monitoring of ESFRI Landmarks is now officially over! All Landmarks that were involved in the process have been notified about the results.
The final public report of this 1st Monitoring Batch is available below to download

Monitoring of the 2nd Batch of Landmarks has already started. The 3rd Batch is now in the process of establishing panels and informing the Landmarks

BACKGROUND
ESFRI Landmarks were introduced in the ESFRI Roadmap 2016 as reference RIs and are pillars in the ERA landscape offering not only services to academic research, but also supporting development and innovation. Guaranteeing the excellence of the Landmark label, ESFRI has responsibility for monitoring the quality of the RIs listed in the ESFRI roadmap as Landmarks.
In the follow-up to the , and the pilot review of four Landmarks assessing the scientific status and their implementation, ESFRI has set up an ad hoc . It prepared a final report containing general criteria for Landmark and RI assessment and considerations for implementing an appropriate methodology in the future. This report addressed various aspects of Landmarks and developed a set of KPIs. The  was approved and published by ESFRI in December 2019.
The ad hoc Working Group also recommended a quality standard for Key Performance Indicators (the RACER-Criteria)4 and a dialogue process between the RIs and the evaluating organisations to define the most appropriate KPIs that would at the same time fulfil the objectives of the ESFRI assessment.
In order to prepare and implement a fully consistent procedure for monitoring of ESFRI Landmarks, ESFRI has set up another working group, namely the Monitoring Implementation Group, with the mandate to propose a methodology for the monitoring of Landmarks on the ESFRI Roadmap. The working group has prepared a , which identified options for implementation of Landmark monitoring by ESFRI and provided directions for further development of the ESFRI monitoring framework and for uptake of the ESFRI monitoring approach beyond the Landmarks.

KEY FEATURES OF THE LANDMARK MONITORING PROCESS

Landmark monitoring by ESFRI has the following objectives:



enabling regular exchange between ESFRI and Landmarks on their long-term development;
assessing the quality of each individual Landmark;
identification of possible problems and supporting the Landmarks to take appropriate actions;
gathering information on the performance, outputs and impacts of the Landmarks.

Additionally, the outcomes of the Landmark monitoring exercise will provide insights into the functioning of the European RI ecosystem as a whole and will contribute to the identification of gaps in the European landscape and future opportunities for the RIs in Europe.
Each Landmark shall be monitored at regular intervals of about five years. Monitoring will be based on qualitative information gathered through a questionnaire and quantitative information represented by KPIs. In line with the two ESFRI monitoring reports mentioned in the previous chapter, RIs are invited to use the ESFRI KPIs, however, they may be replaced or complemented by other KPIs, which capture specific objectives of the Landmarks. The obtained information will be complemented by hearings (virtual) and site visits (if considered necessary by the Monitoring Panels), as relevant. The monitoring should be based as much as possible on the information already available, which Landmarks prepare for their governing bodies and the broader public.
Monitoring will cover Landmarks which have already started their operational phase and actively provide services. All eligible Landmarks will be monitored before the end of 2024, in three batches. Monitoring of the first batch will start in September 2022, after preparatory work starting from June 2022.
The Landmark monitoring process is coordinated by the ESFRI Monitoring Committee, while each Landmark will be analysed by a dedicated Monitoring Panel.
All the details of the Monitoring process can be found in the relevant Public Guides available via the links further above and down below.

Roadmap 2026 InfoDay





















 


 


 
Brussels, Belgium08.10.2024The ESFRI Strategic Report on RIs in Europe, known as the ESFRI Roadmap, has been, for the past 22 years, the prestigious result of a laborious collaborative process aspiring to guarantee the creation of and access to large European Research Infrastructures with the vision to expand European scientific excellence.

ESFRI organises an Information Day, on 8 October 2024 in Brussels, to kick-off the process of updating its Roadmap (to be completed in 2026). Top Roadmap stakeholders will provide a thorough presentation of the requirements, the procedure and the methodology of selection of proposals for new RI Projects to enter the Roadmap. There will also be further presentations on the monitoring of ESFRI RI projects already on the Roadmap.

The Info Day will last the whole morning of the 8 October and will be hosted by the European Commission in Brussels.

Attendance requires physical presence and registration is open to all, until maximum venue capacity is reached. We expect that

max 1 person per existing ESFRI RI project or other stakeholder organisation can be accommodated
at least one person per provisional new project proposal can be accommodated

Please express your interest to attend the InfoDay via the registration form and you will receive a follow-up confirmation email during the first week of July.
  








 
  

 













Please note that due to limited seats, only one representativeper entity or ESFRI Project/Landmark will be guaranteed a place.

      The European Commission and the Strategy Forum ESFRI encourage the continued elaboration and updating of national roadmaps for research infrastructures in the Member States and Associated Countries. 
    
 




The National RoadmapsThe European Commission and ESFRI encourage Member States and Associated Countries to develop national roadmaps for research infrastructures (RIs). These roadmaps are vital blueprints which enable countries to set national priorities and to earmark funds for both national and pan-European RIs including ESFRI ones. In addition the national roadmaps must be linked to the regional smart specialisation strategies: this is a pre-condition to the use of European Structural and Investment Funds.

INCT is studying a case with national sanitary authorities to find effective methods of dealing with currently threatening Sars-Cov-2 and other pathogens that may appear in the future. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses very sensitive to ionizing radiation and can be deactivated by electron beam, X-rays or gamma rays, but the data for COVID-19 are still not sufficient. The global actions and joined research are needed to gain knowledge of all aspects of emerging disease, thusall comments or information about similar activities are welcome(contact Prof. Chmielewski via).

European RIs vs COVID-19
We are currently experiencing a public health crisis unprecedented in the modern European history of the last decades. As thousands of European citizens are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 every day and the number of casualties is increasing rapidly, Europe needs a coordinated effort of all available knowledge and resources to fight the pandemic.

ESFRI believesthat the opportunities provided by European Research Infrastructures to support the science-led response to the COVID-19 outbreak are extremely important.ESFRI is helping the scientific community byaggregating information about dedicated servicesoffered by Research Infrastructures and communicating all relevant actions as broadly as possible. To this end, ESFRI has created this focused webpage that lists and provides quick links to the information gathered.

This page will be updated regularly, as more information becomes availablefrom all over Europe.Wewould like also like to invite all national & European Research Infrastructures to provide any information on their COVID-19 related activities and services in order to be added to this page.

Please use  and  for any communication.
ESFRI Chair, Jan Hrusak, and the Executive Board of the Forum would like to express their sincere thanks to all Research Infrastructures for their eager response to this urgent call for information and for their overall motivation to provide their best services for this fight.
#ERAvsCorona Action Plan
This ESFRI initiative feeds into a larger set of coordinated R&I actions at EU level presented in the . The Action Plan sets out key measures to coordinate, share, and increase support for R&I.
In particular, for Research Infrastructures,  are being added and re-oriented to support RI projects providing services and activities in response to the Coronavirus outbreak. In order to share research data, a European  for Coronavirus is also being established in the framework of the .

ESFRI Scripta Vol3: Innovation oriented Cooperation of Research Infrastructures01.01.2018
The third volume of the ESFRI Scripta series is built on the outcomes of the ad hoc Working Group on Innovation as approved by the Forum in March 2016. This ESFRI Scripta volume 'Innovation-oriented cooperation of Research Infrastructures' describes the different forms of industry and Research Infrastructure collaboration that generate innovation: industry as supplier for the construction / upgrade of the RIs, being instructed and guided in developing new technologies or production protocols; industry as partner of RIs and industry as user exploiting the specific dedicated access modes as well as through the academic access supported by research grants.


  

 




ESFRI Scripta Vol2: Long-Term Sustainability of Research Infrastructures01.10.2017
The second volume of the ESFRI Scripta series is dedicated to the outcomes of the ad hoc Working (WG) Group on Long-Term Sustainability (LTS) of Research Infrastructures.ESFRI has previously developed its concept of lifecycle of the Research Infrastructures in the framework of the Roadmap evaluation exercise, and at all stages of the lifecycle different aspects of sustainability were identified. The LTS WG has analysed the Long-Term Sustainability of Research Infrastructures from a broad perspective taking the ESFRI viewpoint well beyond the mere economical analysis.


  

 




ESFRI Scripta Vol1: Neutron scattering facilities in Europe Present status and future perspectives01.09.2016
The "Neutron scattering facilities in Europe - Present status and future perspectives" report (ESFRI Scripta Vol. 1) has been published. The Volume will be distributed to ESFRI Delegations that will convene in Matera on 23 September 2016 and presented worldwide during the next International Conference on Research Infrastructures (ICRI2016) that will take place in Cape Town from 3 to 5 October 2016.

2nd StR ESFRI Exchange of Experience Workshop Report 18.01.2017
The 2nd workshop to exchange experience and best practise was focused on the monitoring and periodic review of Research Infrastructures on the ESFRI Roadmap. The purpose behind the 2nd workshop was to explain the ESFRI monitoring and evaluation process, to make it clear, comprehensible, transparent and fair. The workshop also provided a platform for effective, high-level interaction (exchange of experiences), coordination and networking between ESFRI projects and ESFRI Landmarks on the one hand, and the European Commission, H2020 Expert Advisory Group on RIs and ESFRI Strategy Working Groups (SWG) & Implementation Group (IG) on the other hand.

ESFRI-EOSC Task Force releases opinion paper on FAIR data















 




19.04.2024Thehas published an opinion paper highlighting the importance of FAIRprinciples in research and innovation. The paper, titled , focuses on Quality-Assessed FAIR-Data (QAFAIRD) productivity, aiming to evaluate and enhance FAIR data practices in Research Infrastructures (RIs) and clusters.
Key objectives of the initiative include assessing current FAIR data productivity levels, identifying bottlenecks, and determining necessary EOSC services for improvement. The paper also explores the impact of AI tools on FAIR data management and research protocols. This publication underscores the Task Force's commitment to promoting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration across scientific fields through FAIR data practices.
This work is based on the results of the ESFRI-EOSCthat took place on 23-24 January 2024, in Milan, Italy.

ESFRI publishes Report on Access to RIs















 




23.01.2024In an effort of identify the challenges to broader and effective access to Research Infrastructures (RIs) as needed by users to tackle scientific and societal challenges, and to underpin the new European Research Area (ERA), ESFRI Drafting Group on Access implemented a set of surveys in May-June 2023targeting research infrastructuresand RI stakeholders. 
The respondents express a large diversity of types of access (physical, remote, virtual), nature of service offered (access to equipment, to data, to collection etc.),often depending on the domain and the nature of the RI. Among the barriers to broader access, several legal, institutional, and financial aspects were raised as well as technical aspects.
The outcomes of the survey arepresented in detail in the ESFRIreport on Access to Research Infrastructures and Charter on Access to RIs.Preliminary recommendations to address access challenges and revisethe European Charter of Access to Research Infrastructures are also included.
The full report is available via Zenodo:

ESFRI publishes Policy Brief on Assessment of Impact of RIs















 




03.07.2023During the 84thForum meeting (Lund, 20-22 June 2023) ESFRI adopted a Policy Brief on assessing the impact of Research Infrastructures (RIs).
The report is a response to the request of the Competitiveness Council, which asked ESFRI to "look into the approaches by Member States, the Commission, international organisations and RIs to assess scientific, societal and economic impacts of investments in RIs by the end of 2023".
Thehighlights the importance of understanding the differences between performance monitoring, which ESFRI started implementing last year, and impact assessment for RIs. It provides recommendations to stakeholders, policymakers, funders, governments, RIs, ESFRI, and the EC.
Key points include the following:

Acknowledging the differences between RIs and avoiding direct comparisons in impact assessments.
No one-size-fits-all methodology for impact assessments; a customised approach should be taken.
Recognising the relevance of scientific impact while also considering various other socioeconomic impacts.
Taking into account the longitudinal nature of impact assessments and the need for data collection over time.

Report on Cooperation of ESFRI RIs with Industry now published















 




26.07.2023The cooperation between Research Infrastructures (RIs) and industry plays a crucial role in achieving scientific excellence and fostering innovation potential. However, the level of cooperation and its challenges remain less defined and monitored. To address this, ESFRI undertook a study on RI cooperation, exploring existing documents and conducting surveys with RIs. The findings of the report, titled , highlight the need for policy actions to enhance mutual benefits and overcome barriers such as different mindsets, access rules, and intellectual property rights. Understanding RIs' potential to assist industry and society is vital for optimal resource allocation and successful cooperation.
The report emphasizes the importance of strategic analysis and ESFRI's role in defining the space for cooperation between RIs and technology infrastructures (TIs) to increase impact. The recommendations provided serve as a valuable input for advancing the RI-Industry cooperation landscape.
The full report is available via Zenodo:

Belgian Presidency Conference: RIs in a Changing Global, Environmental & Socio-economical Context















 




23.04.2024The invites you to register your participationforthe conference "" that will take place on 4-5 June 2024, at the Royal Library of Belgium (KBR), in Brussels.
The conference will focus on 3 main issues:

Research Infrastructures (RIs) as key players of strategic autonomy in a changing global context;
the socio-economic and environmental impact of RIs and
the broad ecosystems of RIs

Research infrastructures are increasingly faced with a changing global context, facing a volatile and unstable geopolitical situation on the global scene, new and rapidly changing political priorities (open strategic autonomy, digital and environmental transition, mission-oriented policies). This requires flexibility, capacity to adapt and resilience. RIs are already confronted with the scarcity of some crucial raw material and disruption in the supply chain. The conference will explore the value of RIs to open strategic autonomy, their contributions to key political objectives like the Green Deal and look at the broad ecosystem, the relation with national/regional RIs and other initiatives and instruments.

Science Clusters publish position statement on operational commitment to EOSC and Open Research















 




04.03.2024The (alsoknown as ESFRI Science Clusters) have released their ,which articulates theirvision for the future towards the successful implementation of the EOSC, as the result of five years of collaborative efforts, including interactions with the European Commission, EOSC Association, , and e-Infrastructure Reflection Group (e-IRG).



The document highlights that the Science Clusters prioritise advancing researchers access to data, tools, and resources for data-driven science, and contribute to the sustainability of ESFRI and pan-European RIs through the development of a cross-border open innovation environment for FAIR data management and analytical services, respectful of CARE (Collective Benefits, Authority to Control, Responsibility and Ethics) principles and attentive to digital security.

The position paper:

Acknowledges the progress accomplished, updates the common work plan from 2021, expresses the Science Clusters' determination to establish thematic community-based EOSC Science Cluster Nodes, contingent upon resources and explains the potential implications on the interconnection with the EOSC EU Node and national nodes.
Emphasises adaptability of the Science Clusters to a unified vision capable of accepting different needs within EOSC and outlines their operational role within the EOSC Federation.
Demonstrates the requirement for urgent support of a targeted Science Cluster destination action within Horizon Europe and future framework programmes in order to enable the operational role of the Science Clusters.

Prior to its open dissemination, the document was presented and discussed in the  (1 March, 2024), with representatives of key stakeholders, including the EC, ESFRI and EOSC boards, and the EOSC Association.

About Science Clusters
The science clusters have grown out of five collaborative projects funded by the European Union in 2019 to link ESFRI and other world-class Research Infrastructures (RIs) to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The services developed by the clusters and other outcomes of the projects are cornerstones of the emerging EOSC fabric and support both disciplinary communities and multidisciplinary initiatives with harmonised models for access to data, tools, workflows and training. Each cluster unites multiple RIs in their specific scientific domain.
