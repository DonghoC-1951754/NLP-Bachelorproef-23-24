aims at raising awareness and engaging the discussion with and between citizens on the use of health data beyond individual care. The ideas and opinions expressed by citizens during this e-consultation feed into recommendations on how to sensitise citizens to and engage them with the reuse of their health data in a Belgian as well as European perspective. 

this e-consultation is a pilot project within TEHDaS  primarily concentrate on the citizens of the three countries organizing it, namely Belgium, France and the United Kingdom. However, it will be open to any EU citizen willing to participate.

Goal of this project is thus not scientific, as the contributions that will be collected will not necessarily be representative of the sociodemographic characteristics of European citizens. The goal is simply to disseminate the informative materials to as many citizens as possible and to give everyone the opportunity to let their voice be heard on the platform.

Expected results:
An increase in the general awareness
A better understanding of the state of citizens' perceptions, beliefs and preferences towards health data secondary use and sharing
Involvement of citizens in the debate and in the search for solutions
