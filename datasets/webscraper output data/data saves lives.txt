How can sharing your health data help others?












In the last 5 years, more scientific data has been generated than in the entire history of mankind Societies that can reliably and responsibly record and share the health data of its citizens across research communities will advance the understanding of diseases, allow new medicines to be developed more quickly, and empower individuals to benefit others with the same or other medical conditions.The responsible use of our health data will improve the wellbeing of citizens, make our healthcare systems effective, data-driven and easier to use, speed up scientific research, and make healthcare services more sustainable in a Europe that will remain a global leader in medical innovation.

Protecting Health Data













73% of EU citizens want to share health data on the precondition that data is secure and only accessible by authorised partiessource: ec.europa.eu/health/Every patient must be able to find out how their data is used and the protections that are in place to keep it secure. The more informed people feel, the more likely they are to support the use of data sharing. So, it is of utmost importance to our initiative to keep peoples health data safe and secure and communicate how we do this to the public.







With data privacy playing a more significant role in both the public conversation and the legal environment with the implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, it is critical to understand how popular views on health data are evolving.
