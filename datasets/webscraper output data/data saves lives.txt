How can sharing your health data help others?












In the last 5 years, more scientific data has been generated than in the entire history of mankind Societies that can reliably and responsibly record and share the health data of its citizens across research communities will advance the understanding of diseases, allow new medicines to be developed more quickly, and empower individuals to benefit others with the same or other medical conditions.The responsible use of our health data will improve the wellbeing of citizens, make our healthcare systems effective, data-driven and easier to use, speed up scientific research, and make healthcare services more sustainable in a Europe that will remain a global leader in medical innovation.

How does access to health data help identify people at high risk of bowel cancer?












Protecting Health Data













73% of EU citizens want to share health data on the precondition that data is secure and only accessible by authorised partiessource: ec.europa.eu/health/Every patient must be able to find out how their data is used and the protections that are in place to keep it secure. The more informed people feel, the more likely they are to support the use of data sharing. So, it is of utmost importance to our initiative to keep peoples health data safe and secure and communicate how we do this to the public.







With data privacy playing a more significant role in both the public conversation and the legal environment with the implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, it is critical to understand how popular views on health data are evolving.

Health Data Explained










Overview - Health dataWhat is health data?













Health data refers to any data describing a persons health, their healthcare or anything affecting any health issues or diseases they may have. This includes information created by health and care professionals, as well as information generated by patients; from illnesses monitored through mobile applications and smart devices, to screening tests and nutritional data.







Any health data is personal and private, so it must be kept safe and secure at all times. Surveys show that while people are generally comfortable with anonymised health data being used in healthcare services, research and other situations where there is a public benefit, they also would like the power to decide who gets to use the data, and for what purposes.







What is Big Data? 













The term Big Data is increasingly used to describe extensive collections of data, called repositories. In healthcare, Big Data is often used to describe large healthcare databases or networks of interconnected healthcare databases coming from multiple organisations. From these databases, we can collate and study data involving large patient numbers in order to improve healthcare delivery and aid future research.







Why is health data important?

Healthcare systems are challenged by growing and ageing populations who are living with more chronic disease. There is an urgent need for more effective and smarter medicine to deliver better care to patients. Learnings from health data can help contribute to discoveries that will show us how to make these improvements.

What is health data?What are the different types of health data?













Data helps us to understand a person's health, their health risks and how their health is being managed. Different types of health data include: Information created by health and care professionals:Electronic health records.National healthcare databases holding items like prescriptions, laboratory tests, and details about important diseases like cancer.Information created by patients:Monitoring illnesses using computer or mobile phone applications.Wearable devices such as smartwatches for fitness monitoring and tracking changes relevant to medical conditions.How people prevent illness or detect illnesses early, such as screening tests and dietary monitoring.Social media posts can be analysed anonymously in aggregate form, for example, to discover how many people are discussing certain side effects of a new treatment.Wider information that can affect peoples health, such as climate and pollution monitoring data.




We need to co-operate much more in-betweendifferent parts of the health care system but alsobetween the health care system and patients

 Hanna Svensson



Personal sensor data is expected to grow from 10% of all stored information to 90% within the next decade. Thankfully, many healthcare organisations no longer use paper: health records are collected electronically, making the data easier to analyse. Alongside the information collected from patients, all this data can help study large populations, discover new knowledge, provide insights into the health needs of patients, and improve treatment outcomes.

What is big data?What does Big Data involve?The term Big Data originated from the discipline of computer science, it was initially used to describe large, rapidly growing and complex databases with a high volume of data. In a healthcare setting, Big Data is used to describe the extensive healthcare databases (like electronic health record systems) or networks of interconnected healthcare databases (called linked databases) coming from multiple healthcare organisations.













We need to study the data on large patient numbers to conduct specific types of research. For example, we would use big data to identify specific or unusual patterns of a health condition, to investigate the impact of different treatments used to treat a condition or to discover rare side-effects or long-term health outcomes. This growing research need requires greater investment by countries and companies to establish networks that allow large-scale data analysis. We can expect to see a growing number of new insights and advances from the analysis of big data. Hopefully, this will involve the rapid development of new medicines and medical devices, as well as smart applications to support healthcare professionals and patientsCommunities of patients with rare diseases, alongside the health professionals and scientists involved, are trailblazers in how to work together to advance our understanding of disease and the best treatments. We strive to enable data science to transform public health. A few of the societal benefits that may arise from analysing big data include: Increasing the effectiveness and quality of treatments. Identifying risk factors and thus preventing diseases or conditions.Improving patient safety by delivering patient information directly to healthcare professionals.Predicting outcomes and identifying pathways in disease transmission, making them preventable.Disseminating knowledge.Reducing inefficiencies by identifying healthcare systems that do not work well.What does this look like in reality? So far, published findings derived from big data include:Validating >200 novel biomarkers predicting cardiovascular risk. Investigating variation of 174,000 observed national prescribing patterns to national guidelines for COPD.Comparing ~8,000 treatment outcomes for leukaemia by age: uncovering a major unmet treatment need.Mining >700 million records to develop new cancer risk stratification algorithms.You can find these and other examples of research using big data in our

Health Data Explained










Why is health data important?Public health could be dramatically transformed by data science. Healthcare systems are increasingly challenged by growing and ageing populations who are living with more chronic disease. More effective and smarter medicine is needed to deliver better care to patients. The challenge is to deliver this within the same healthcare budgets. New opportunities are arising for treatment through genetics, and better decision making is possible using algorithms and artificial intelligence. Learning more from health data can support these changes and help achieve better care in a cost-efficient manner.













Benefits for Patients When health providers have access to a patients up-to-date health data, they can provide more efficient, higher quality, safer and more personalised care and care coordination. Patients looking at their own health data gain insight into how their health is evolving over time. They will be more health literate and empowered, allowing them to adapt their lifestyle more easily, which has a positive impact on their care outcomes and quality of life. Moreover, they will better interact with their health and care professionals.Health data provided to scientific research will speed up the development of new medical products and treatments for individuals who need them.



 Healthcare systemsOrganisations working with health data are developing many vitally needed healthcare improvements that: Identify risk factors and speed up diagnosis.Identify pathways in disease transmission, thus preventing diseases or conditions.Predict outcomes and increase the effectiveness of treatments.Improve the quality and safety of treatments.Disseminate knowledge.Enhance public health strategy.



 Healthcare providersIndividual health and care professionals and provider organisations can use health data to: Redesign better care pathways.Improve patient care.Gain insights for strategic planning and organisational quality improvement.Utilise healthcare resources more efficiently.Participate in more clinical research.



 Medical researchHealth data can support research organisations and scientific associations to develop new treatments and devices, such as: A new drug to help tackle a cancer that is difficult to treat, developed by a pharmaceutical company.An infusion pump that delivers a controlled dose of medication to somebody continuously while they are at work or home, developed by a medical device manufacturer.A smart monitoring system that gives the patient an alert on their mobile phone when a blood measurement needs urgent attention, developed by a health software company.A better way to support patients with advanced dementia in their home, pioneered by a social services organisation.Every country needs to use its populations health data to learn how healthcare can be better delivered.

Health Data Explained










Data protectionMany patients are surprised that health data is not better utilised, especially within national health systems. However, it is also known from surveys that members of the public are concerned about what they read and hear about data breaches. Many of those breaches are in other industry sectors. People are sometimes anxious about how well their health data can be securely stored and communicated where it is needed.Because accurate data is so important for our healthcare systems, public bodies, care professionals and industry need to work together to enable the better use of health data, and to do it in trustworthy ways.




Patients are really willing to donate data but there is always the aspect of  trust

 Mitchell Silva


Mitchell Silva, patient representative

The results of the use of health data must be translated back into improvements for patients.



Shared and aggregated health dataData is originally collected by different organisations, for different purposes, most commonly to support the health and care to individuals. These organisations hold patient data in order to ensure that patients continue to receive the best possible care. It is generally accepted by most health systems, and by most patients, that an organisation like a hospital will examine its own collection of patient data in order to identify ways that it can improve the quality, timeliness and safety of care that its teams deliver. However, this data can be aggregated at a larger population level, for a wider range of learning and improved health care for patients across a wide range of settings. This may be within a country or across many countries.



It is absolutely essential that the privacy of individuals is protected when using their health data for learning, quality improvement and research.



Data protection measures 





View fullsize










GDPR Personal data about European citizens is legally protected, most recently through the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018. Patients must now be told how their data will be used, for what purposes, and how it will be protected. In some situations patients will be asked to formally consent to particular uses of their data, for example by signing a consent form. 







Codes of practice Health data users need to adopt strict codes of practice that comply with the GDPR. Codes of practice can also ensure that the purposes for which data is used meet the following criteria: they have a legal basis they are in societys interests they are ethical. It is expected by patients that health data users will only use the data for the purposes that are permitted.







Information security measures Information security is a method that uses different measures to protect computer systems, networks and their data from any accidental or deliberate disclosure, access or damage. An organisation using health data must adopt recognised information security practices to protect the data in their possession and while being used by their staff.

Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a rare genetic and progressive neuromuscular condition, which occurs in around 1 in every 6,000 to 10,000 live births. While symptoms do vary from person to person, it causes progressive muscle weakness and wasting. It can have significant health impacts. In severe cases, if left untreated, it is usually fatal by the age of around two years.

Patient registries are a valuable source of real-world data (RWD)What is the health challenge?Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a rare genetic and progressive neuromuscular condition, which occurs in around 1 in every 6,000 to 10,000 live births. While symptoms do vary from person to person, it causes progressive muscle weakness and wasting. It can have significant health impacts. In severe cases, if left untreated, it is usually fatal by the age of around two years.What was the purpose of the research using real-world data?Although there have been major advances in clinical care and treatment of SMA in recent years, with three treatments approved by regulators in the EU, most clinical trials have focused on the safety and effectiveness of treatments in children and babies, with very limited data available in adults (aged 18 years and older). It is therefore difficult to demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of treatments in the adult population, so evidence must be derived from other sources. With the help of RWD, which is derived from use in clinical practice, further evidence of treatment effectiveness in adult population can be collected. So how is RWD collected? Patient registries are an organised way of collecting RWD using observational methods and following the same patients over time. They may be organised as either disease or product (treatment) registries. Most registries in SMA are disease registries, enrolling patients regardless of treatment status to further characterise the natural history of the disease (which is often limited in rare disease) as well as the effectiveness and real-world safety of different SMA treatments. Collating patient information in disease registries helps to avoid fragmented or siloed approaches for collecting RWD, which may arise when data is gathered with individual product registries.













Why and how was health data used?At the time of initial EU marketing authorisation in May 2017 for the first treatment in SMA, the completed clinical trials included participants of different ages, disease stages, and severity, but there were limited data in adults. Since that time, evidence has been collected from clinical practice to further support and inform the safe and effective use of such treatment in adults. This includes RWD generated from the collaborative network of SMA disease registries, in which participating patients have provided their consent for their data to be used for research purposes.In 2022, the product information was updated to reflect this additional data on the clinical effectiveness in some SMA adult type II and III patients. Also, the real-world safety data in the adult population were shown to be consistent with the known safety profile of the treatment derived from clinical trials. This [label] update means that adults with SMA and treating physicians now have a greater understanding of the efficacy and safety of this treatment in a broader population.This case study is an example of how RWD can be used to provide additional useful information for patients and healthcare professionals. Despite this advancement, it is still relatively uncommon for this type of information to be used to support regulatory decisions around effectiveness, and for it to be included in medicinal product labelling. However, a publication authored by European Medicines Agency (EMA) representatives1, endorses that rigorous RWE alongside clinical trial data should be viewed as complementary, and together may be informative for establishing treatment effectiveness in certain regulatory use cases. What is the benefit to healthcare?Patient registries are an important source of RWD, which can be analysed and translated into RWE. The inclusion of RWE information in product information is support by the regulatory agency and provides healthcare professionals with the reassurance they need to rely on this to make clinical decisions. The case study is hoped to be the first of many examples where RWE is used to inform label updates.Patient databases hold the key to optimising treatment options and require collaborationPatient disease registries have considerable potential to generate valuable information and contribute to our understanding in certain disease areas, but they require investment in resources, capacity and co-ordination to fully deliver on this promise. establishing and managing SMA patient registries, in collaboration with academics and treatment centres, is a great example of how the power of data can be unlocked through the appropriate use of resources and multi-stakeholder collaboration. It requires strong co-operative partnerships to ensure that registries become increasingly harmonised and interoperable to generate high-quality real-world data to support decision making by different stakeholders, including regulators and reimbursement authorities, in the future.

Using real world data (RWD) from patient databases to understand who could benefit from treatment In this case study we examine how analysis of real-world patient data gathered from local Health Units can be a useful tool to assess adherence to treatment, in addition to estimating the population who might benefit from a fixed-dose combination medicine. Medication adherence is a significant issue for many patients with co-morbidities Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the most common cause of death worldwide. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, equating to 32% of all global deaths. Many patients have multiple CVD risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high lipids, and therefore require multiple different treatments to manage these conditions. However, studies have shown that in real-world settings, treatment adherence is poor in this patient group.,  Understanding treatment adherence is a complex issue, with many factors contributing towards this, such as a patients personality, socio-economic status, and the ability to communicate with their clinical team. Low adherence reduces treatment benefits for patients and in turn places a significant burden on the healthcare system as treatment takes longer. Therefore, there is an urgent need to simplify treatment regimens of the existing best in class molecules to increase adherence and to improve clinical outcomesRWD is a valuable source of patient information One study, which is the focus of this case study, looked to determine the number of patients who might be eligible for a triple fixed-dose treatment (a single tablet combining atorvastatin/perindopril/amlodipine (CTAPA)), and to estimate if an unmet medical need exists among these patients. 













Patient anonymity is paramount to ethical research This was an observational retrospective study based on data from 2,292 adult patients, which was obtained from three Italian Local Health Units. Each patient was identified in the databases by an anonymous code, therefore no identifiers related to patients were provided to the researchers. All the results were produced as aggregated summaries (collective data), which are not possible to assign, either directly or indirectly, to the individual patients. RWD data can be used to understand current unmet need All patients had a prescription for CTAPA as individual tablets, and the study found that only around half (54%) of patients took their treatments as prescribed. The findings allowed the team to estimate a clear unmet need. Considering the total Italian national population, approximately 69,665 patients with high blood pressure were potentially eligible for treatment with fixed-dose combination therapy during 2014, which may have improved adherence.This is an excellent example of how RWD can be used to provide evidence of an important unmet need, which could only have been identified using real-world evidence analysis. The findings can help healthcare professionals and researchers to explore possible interventions, which in this case, could be a simplified treatment regime (fixed-dose combination medicine) that may improve adherence levels.

Using National Cancer Registry data for the benefit of the brain tumour communityIn 2015, brain cancer charity, braintrust, saw an opportunity: a widening gap between the traditional approach to epidemiology of cancer and questions that the clinical and patient communities have. There was a need, and scope, for an evolving registration service to develop the conversation about cancer beyond such traditional indicators as:1, 3, and 5 year survival Mortality and morbidityPrevalenceIncidenceGenderAgeThe aim was to broaden the discourse around epidemiology of care so that the some of the wider questions that patients, carers and clinicians have around care could be addressed. The charity looked at registry data in new ways to address important questions for the brain tumour community and established a process that can be used by other cancer sites. The policy context for this piece of work is significant. At the Britain Against Cancer conference (Dec 2017) the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Cancer published its inquiry Progress of the England Cancer Strategy: Delivering outcomes by 2020?. Among concerns raised in the inquiry is that the APPG is calling for NHS England and Public Health England to increase data transparency by making more of it available to the public and that this must include rare and less common cancers, all aspects of the patient pathway, and national and local data. [1] Six years since the launch of braintrusts project, the systems are well established, patient anonymity guaranteed, and we now have unprecedented access to data on rarer and less common cancers, such as brain cancer.MethodologyIn order to fulfil its duty as a public health agency responsible for cancer prevention and control in England, the NDRS is expected to produce evidence about cancer incidence, diagnosis treatment and survival. It fulfils this critical function by a range of outputs (Standard Output Tables), including official statistics and reports, and support for public health research on cancer. The Standard Output Grouping is a way of partitioning all diagnoses of cancer into groups, where each group contains approximately 100 people with the same characteristics. The grouping can be viewed as a rooted branching tree, where the first node is the group 'all tumours', and each branch point divides by a dimension of interest (e.g. age, region, sex). If a node contains too few tumours then it cannot be divided further without making groups of less than 100, and so the tree terminates there. If the node has enough tumours it branches again by the next dimension of interest.Key findingsTop-level outcomes from this work include: The development of the IT interface - it can be doneIt brings data to lifeThis work adds colour to other datasets e.g. early diagnosisEmergent themes align with the James Lind Alliance Top Ten Uncertainties [2]









Three themes emerged from the first statistical release, all of which require further investigation to tell a more informed story:10% of people with a non-malignant brain tumour (NMBT) do not survive one year. 5  9 year olds receiving RT dropped from 43% in 2013 to 27% in 2014.We can see that groups of people (30  49 yr olds and 50  69 year olds) have similar treatment but have a big gap in outcomes.This initial release of data marks a watershed as Public Health England is able to ensure safe and secure policies, processes and procedures are in place that meet the requirements of the law and best practice to ensure that patient data is shared in a way that does not compromise anonymity. However, data on its own does not tell a story. In writing the reports, each of which tells one story, braintrust is bringing meaningful narrative to this data, with the support of clinical, patient and public health partners. See an example of one of its reports on the data here: .It is also working to make the data visually engaging, accessible and meaningful to the general public. You can see the data dashboard theyve created here: .As the project continues to generate data, it will continue to drive conversation on from traditional measures that focus on incidence and survival and help provide evidence at a whole population level, to support improved standards of care for people living with brain cancer and their families.We are delighted to have been able to support NDRS in this work and are grateful to everyone that has worked so hard to manage our expectations.Many thanks to Helen Bulbeck, Director, braintrust, for sharing this case study as an example of how #DataSavesLives.brainstrust is the only UK wide brain cancer charity dedicated to helping patients and their caregivers. We know a brain tumour diagnosis is confusing, isolating and overwhelming. We know these problems are exacerbated by not being able to access care and information quickly and easily. And we also know that access to proactive support, and good information can improve knowledge and understanding, reduce anxiety, increase preparedness for events, instil control and improve satisfaction with treatment in brain tumour patients. Thats why were here.brainstrust: Enables patients to stand up for themselves, and therefore secure better outcomesSolves real problems collaborativelyCreates the vision for patients and caregivers to help them understand how their care should beProvides the patient/caregiver voiceWe give the brain tumour community the means to have a voice at the time when it needs it most. The result? A feeling of being in control, and better outcomes for people living with a brain tumour.[1] APPG on Cancer Inquiry December 2017[2]

Helping the Fight Against Alzheimer's DiseaseDiscovering a test to detect those at risk of developing Alzheimer's DiseaseWhat was the health challenge?One of the main obstacles to finding a treatment for Alzheimers disease is difficulty detecting the condition in the earliest phases. There is no reliable test that can be used to indicate that a person is just starting to develop this form of dementia.What was the purpose of the research?The research was undertaken to find a new test or biomarker (indicator of the presence of Alzheimers) for use in future clinical research into this disease. The research required a blood sample from a thousand people that could be tested and from whom the Alzheimers process had been measured in spinal fluid or using brain imaging.Clinical data was reused from over 1,000 patients who had previously given fully informed consent to be part of several studies in different countries across Europe. These studies were already looking at the causes, natural history and progression of Alzheimers disease.Why and how was health data used?Data included clinical observations and measurements, test results from brain imaging, biochemical test results, and genetic results. All the data was  and only the clinical data necessary for the study was transferred to the universities of Oxford and Maastricht for analysis.Setting up a research study to collect new data would have taken many years and been enormously expensive. Using pre-existing samples and data, this research could be performed very quickly and at a very low cost.What was the legal basis for using the data?This use of health data complied with data protection legislation because all of the participants had given their fully-informed consent for their data to be used for this kind of research.What were the results?This research has discovered a test that is likely to be very useful at predicting which patients are at high risk of developing Alzheimers disease.What was the benefit to healthcare?The use of this new test will help to improve our understanding of Alzheimers disease and the provision of care. It will help future research to quickly discover patients at the earliest stage of Alzheimers disease, because these are the patients for whom research is likely to reveal the most effective new treatments.This work has also shown how valuable research can be conducted using existing data and blood samples, reducing the time to get results.Further informationScientific research paper:

Early Detection of a Cancer KillerHelping identification of people at high risk of colorectal cancer from an existing blood test.





View fullsize










What was the health challenge?Cancer of the colon (also known as the bowel) and rectum (colorectal cancer) is the second most common cancer with more than 470,000 Europeans being diagnosed every year. It kills 228,000 Europeans every year. Like many cancers, the earlier this cancer is detected, the greater chance that treatment will be successful. It is for these reasons that testing (called screening) of adults for colorectal cancer is available in some countries as a routine, especially for patients with a family history of that condition. However, around half of the people that qualify for screening do not take up this offer.What was the purpose of the research?This research was undertaken to find out if it was possible to detect those people at higher risk of this cancer by analysing results from a blood test that patients have already taken for other reasons, so they can be encouraged to attend for screening.Why and how was health data used?Patient data were obtained from two independent sources: Maccabi Health Services (), one of the four Health Maintenance Organizations in Israel, and the UK Health Improvement Network (THIN). In all cases the data were anonymous and only contained age, gender and several laboratory values. In addition, whether or not patients developed cancer was identified from the cancer registry in Israel or the THIN database in the UK.The research developed a new algorithm to assess the risk of a person having colorectal cancer for people aged over 50. An algorithm is a set of rules used by, for example, a computer programme to analyse and process data to produce a specific output. Anonymous blood test results on 450,000 individuals from MHS were analysed in order to develop this algorithm. This large number of patient tests was needed in order to detect rare combinations of test results and cancer risk.Before being put into use, the algorithm was tested on two separate and independent sets of blood test results of primary care patients, containing over 139,000 further Israeli patients from MHS and over 25,500 British patients from THIN. Despite these different populations, the algorithm performed well in both sets of blood test results.What was the legal basis for using the data?This use of health data complied with data protection legislation because all patient records were  by MHS or THIN before any researcher was granted access.What were the results?The computer program is now available as part of a colorectal cancer screening system through the company . It is available in Israel and the UK, with other countries expected to be added in the near future.What was the benefit to patients and healthcare systems?By helping clinicians to identify patients who may be at higher risk of colorectal cancer, those patients can be more strongly encouraged to attend for a formal screening. The initial experience of this algorithm is that 9% of people identified as being at high risk were then found on full screening to have a very early colorectal cancer, which could be treated.Further informationPeered review article:The additional evidence coming out of commercial usage of the model:

A link between Body Mass Index and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseaseWhat was the health challenge?Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is usually a harmless condition of the liver. However, in some people it can proceed to inflammation of the liver which can then lead on to liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis gradually destroys the livers cells so that the liver eventually fails. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a calculation, based on a persons weight and height, to measure the extent to which someone is overweight or obese. A link between obesity and NAFLD has been assumed for many years because of findings from research studies involving small numbers of patients. There has been no large-scale research studying the distribution and patterns of what levels of BMI are linked to NAFLD.What was the purpose of the research?The purpose of this study was to better understand the link between BMI and NAFLD. It was conducted by a collaborative team of research scientists from the British Heart Foundation, the University of Glasgow, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.Why and how was health data used?Using databases that contain large amounts of anonymised patient data it was possible to conduct research into the link between BMI and NAFLD. Large patient numbers are needed to study which people with different BMI levels over time do eventually develop NFALD, and which do not. Starting with databases containing data on over 30 million patients, the research eventually studied the records of just over 2 million patients who had the necessary data recorded in the database, and who did not have other conditions that would affect BMI or NAFLD. Two large anonymised health databases were used in the research - the Health Improvement Network (THIN) database (UK) and the Humedica database (US). The data in these databases contained routinely collected patient data from GPs, specialty care and hospitalisations in the years of 20072013, which had been carefully anonymised.What was the legal basis for using the data?The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not require a legal basis if the health data have been anonymised.What were the results?The results showed that there was a continuous and strong link between a rising BMI and the diagnosis of NAFLD. The link was stronger for men and for people with diabetes.What was the benefit to patients and healthcare systems?This information is useful for patients, public health organisations and clinicians when considering preventative health measures to reduce the likelihood of NAFLD for those patients who are overweight or obese.Further informationReinsert the link to the template Scientific research paper:

Big Data used for the early identification of other diseases associated with cancerA novel computer programme to help doctors and scientists to better understand which other diseases are likely to occur in patients with cancer.What was the health challenge?There were 17 million new cases of cancer worldwide in 2018 and that number continues to rise. Cancer has a huge impact on patients. It is also a major burden for health care systems across the world. Patients with cancer may be at a higher risk of also developing other diseases. If clinicians knew which other diseases have the highest risk of occurring in patients with each type of cancer, they could prioritise trying to detect that disease early or, if possible, prevent it from occurring.What was the purpose of the research?This research was undertaken to improve medical and research understanding of which additional diseases are most likely to occur in patients with cancer. The work focused on patients with the nine most commonly occurring cancers. The researchers first looked at the diseases most often occurring before each patient developed the cancer, in case any of those diseases actually increased the risk of the cancer occurring. They then looked at diseases occurring after the cancer was diagnosed, in case the presence of the cancer increased a patients risk of certain other diseases. Their aim was to develop a way of helping clinicians and researchers in the future to discover which other diseases might be associated with cancer in the same patient over time.Why and how was health data used?Researchers working at the College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University in Taiwan, obtained permission to analyse data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database for almost all the Taiwanese population. This database contains health information on around 782 million outpatient visits. The data they analysed included outpatient visits, dental visits, hospitalisations, medications prescribed, medications refilled, laboratory and imaging examinations and operations.What was the legal basis for using the data?The data provided to the research team was fully anonymised.What were the results?The patient records in the database were first grouped and analysed according to each patients age and gender. The computer programme was set up to detect diseases occurring in any patient within three years of each other, and to display these disease associations in ways that would help a scientist to determine the strongest disease connections. This data was accumulated for millions of patients, to highlight the disease associations that occur most often, and have not just coincided by chance. This collection of disease associations was used to create a visual image that can be rotated or zoomed to enable very detailed inspection. Their system is called the Cancer Associations Map Animation (CAMA).What was the benefit to healthcare systems?Patients with cancers could benefit from this development as their clinicians can be more easily aware of which other diseases a patient might be at risk from, seek to detect those early or possibly to avoid them occurring. The results of this research have been openly published. The CAMA computer system is also openly available to researchers, worldwide.This research is also an example of the benefits of using Big Data through the ability to analyse a large number of patient records whilst protecting each patients identity.Further informationScientific research paper:

How mHealth platforms can provide pro-active and patient-driven follow-up care: a case study from SwedenAdvances in symptom tracking technology through mobile health (mHealth) platforms have the potential not only to help individuals and their clinicians monitor their progress but to provide valuable real-world data that can be used by health regulators in decisions around treatment reimbursement or updates to standards of care. In this case study, we learn how the Cystic Fibrosis community in Sweden partnered with academics and technology developers to create an app to track symptoms and the impact of treatment to support better clinical care. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition affecting over 48,000 people across EuropePeople with CF experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs. This leads to a wide range of symptoms affecting the entire body. It is vital that people with CF receive regular care from a multidisciplinary team in a specialised CF clinic and access to the latest treatments.













Advocacy is key to improving the lives of people living with CFCF Europe, the European Federation of cystic fibrosis patient organisations, advocates for access to optimal treatment and care and promotes patient-centred research aimed at improving the lives of all people with CF. As a membership organisation, CF Europe monitors and promotes advancements in health research led by their members which bring concrete changes in different countries across Europe. This article focuses on the achievements of the Cystic Fibrosis community in Sweden.Real-time symptom tracking has the potential to revolutionise how we evaluate medicines outside of clinical trialsAs new life-changing therapies for CF become available, Swedens CF stakeholders strive to build a system for structured follow-up and evaluation of new treatments for optimal care, best use of resources and patient participation. A national follow-up system, including the National CF Quality Registry and an integrated mHealth platform, Genia, was developed for use when a decision for national reimbursement for CF-specific modulator therapies in 2018 was reached.Patient groups have a significant role to play to ensure mHealth solutions meet the needs of the communityThe mHealth platform, Genia, was developed by Upstream Dream in collaboration with the Swedish CF community at Karolinska Institute in 2014. Genia was first introduced to paediatric CF centres in Sweden and has been well received by patients, with 65% to 87% of families using the app to track symptoms, activities, and aspects of daily care and share them with the clinical team. Genia supports the upload of images (e.g., a patient may take a photo of their mucus) and upload it via the app and can connect to other apps or devices, such as electronic spirometers (a device to measure air volume from the lungs) and smart medication dispensers. Data collected meets National Registry standards, including e-prescription records, and is uploaded by clinicians.Ongoing learning and adjustment are important to deliver continued value from mHealth appsLund paediatric CF Centre has been working with Genia since 2015 to support patient self-management, pre-visit planning and shared decision-making. Systems and processes for working with Genia were already well established and institutionalised with the multi-disciplinary team at the paediatric program when a feature for CF modulator self-management and adherence support was developed. This feature includes weekly treatment check-in reports and questions on antibiotic use that can be shared with healthcare teams.Lund paediatric CF Centre results as of December 2019:Of the patients on the new treatment, 84% (26) have the Genia app with treatment supportOf the Genia users with the treatment support feature, 58% (15) sent 2 check-in reports in December and 88% (23) were active in the Genia app during the last 3 monthsSince the treatment was made available in July 2018, a total of 491 CF modulators check-in reports have been sent to the Lund paediatric CF CentreConclusions:After over a year, the Lund paediatric CF Centre has shown significant success with the implementation of the Genia app for the follow-up of CF modulator therapiesIt has contributed to patient participation, adherence support and patient educationThe use of Genia can allow patients to gather and share real world data with healthcare to support pro-active, patient-driven optimal careThank you to CF Europe for this case study.For more information on the Genia app: For information on the patient in the driver seat programme: Reference:

As experience and research continues to develop, we see that the ability to access data affects not only the patients ability to look after themselves, but also their relationships with their clinical team and with their own illnesses and comorbidities. A shift to being empowered begins at the point of diagnosis, with a collaborative and interactive relationship between patients and healthcare professionals, which empowers patients to take on responsibility for their condition with the appropriate clinical support.

From this work, we could conclude that technology is not considered as the main barrier to data sharing. As one of the experts in our last event concluded, technology will always find its way if a culture of trust is settled first. Indeed, TRUST is seen as the cornerstone of this equation  it is, however, a complex concept and it needs to be fully explored and discussed if we wish to find the right actions to enhance it.

Overview - Resources CenterCase Studies













There is a wide range of ways that patient data can be used to provide better care and improve health. Explore the case studies to learn more. Please let us know if you have good examples to share.







Public Attitude Surveys













It is important to understand and track public perceptions, attitudes, and feelings around uses of health data and privacy regulations. Understanding how the public balances its trust in different data sharing and health issues provides researchers with valuable insights to ensure that their efforts align with the people they seek to serve.

Public Surveys























Public opinions and behaviour around health data in the GDPR eraWith data privacy playing a larger role in both the public conversation and the legal environment with the implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, it is critical to understand how popular views on health data are evolving. Research conducted by Decision Resources Group (DRG) suggests that the public, as well as doctors, are open to sharing health data if they have clarity on when and how it is collected and used.

















Citizens Juries in the UK explore which uses of health data are acceptable to the publicConnected Health Cities (CHC), an initiative in the north of England using health data to improve care, has held two Citizens juries to explore public opinion on data use. Citizens juries involve about 18 citizens spending three or four days together, learning about an issue from expert witnesses and discussing it in small groups, before writing a joint report containing answers to the purpose they have been asked to address.

















Europeans attitudes towards the use of personal dataPeople value having the power to make decisions about the use of their data. Digital services must be recognisable as being fair, and people want to have the power to decide who gets to use the data collected on them, and for what purposes. These are the views held by people in four European countries, according to a survey commissioned by Sitra, a publicly funded research body in Finland

Glossary of terms













Most of the terms listed here have been defined in a glossary produced by the  in the UK. Some have been drawn from the . Some terms have been defined in accordance with international (ISO) standards or European Commission publications.They have been reproduced or adapted here with permission.GlossaryAAccess Control: A means of ensuring that the people who have been given access to all or part of a data record have been approved to do so.Aggregated data: Statistical data about multiple individuals that has been combined to show general trends or values without identifying individuals within the data.Algorithm: a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computerAnonymisation: The process of rendering data into a form which does not identify individuals and where identification is not considered feasible. ()Anonymous: Information that has been modified to no longer make is reasonably possible to identify any of the individuals whose data is included. Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial intelligence refers to systems designed by humans that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital world by perceiving their environment, interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge derived from this data and deciding the best action(s) to take (according to pre-defined parameters) to achieve the given goal.Audit trail or Audit log: A record of everyone who has looked at or changed a record, why and when they did so and what changes were made.Authentication: A process of reliably identifying persons or devices by securely associating an identifier with a means of verification.



BBlockchain: The best known distributed ledger technology providing trust, traceability and security in systems that exchange data or assets, enabling a nal and denitive record of transactions to be held in a network across a series of nodes and avoiding one centralised location and the need for intermediaries services.



CCare Pathway: A plan agreed by all disciplines involved in the care of a specific group of patients (such as patients who have suffered a stroke), which outlines the agreed standards for treatment, based on the best available evidence. It makes clear what different tasks (interventions) need to be done by which professionals, when and where.Carer or Caregiver: An individual who provides unpaid care to a patient or service user, most commonly a member of their family or friend.Clinical Audit: A method for improving practice, patient care or services provided. It is used to compare current practice with a set of standards or criteria, then identify areas for improvement, make changes to practice and re-audit to ensure that improvement has been achieved.Clinical Trial: An investigation in human subjects intended to discover or verify the effect of one or more investigational health interventions (e.g., drugs, diagnostics, devices, therapy protocols) that generate safety and efficacy data before making the health intervention available in health care.Cloud Computing: The storing, processing and use of data on remotely located computers accessed over the internet.Confidential Data or Confidential Information: See Personally identifiable data.Confidentiality: Ensuring that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorised individuals, or organisations.Consent: see Explicit Consent and Implied Consent.Cyber Security: The processes used to safeguard and secure information assets from being stolen or attacked.



DDatabase: A structured set of data held in a computer, in a form that is well suited to analysisData Breach: Any failure to meet the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation, unlawful disclosure or misuse of personally identifiable data and an inappropriate invasion of peoples privacy.Data Controller: a term used to describe an individual or organisation who determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personally identifiable data is or will be processed. It is the responsibility of the Data Controller to ensure that any processing of personally identifiable data has an appropriate legal basis.Data Linkage: A technique that involves bringing together and analysing data from a variety of sources, typically data that relates to the same individual.Data Processor: a term used to describe any person (other than an employee of the Data Controller) who processes personally identifiable data on behalf of the Data Controller. Data Controllers must choose Data Processors carefully and have in place a written contract (detailing the information governance requirements) and effective means of monitoring, reviewing and auditing their processing.Data Security: Protecting data and information systems from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.Data Sharing: The disclosure of data from one or more organisations to another organisation or organisations, or the sharing of data between different parts of a single organisation.Data Subject: An identified or identifiable natural person, who is the subject of personal data.Deep Learning: A particularly accurate machine learning approach with less need of human guidance, referring to the fact that the neural network has several layers between the input and the output, learning the overall input-output relation in successive steps.De-identification: A general term for any process that removes the association between a set of identifiable data and the person it relates to. It is used here specifically to mean the removal of patient identifiers from data.De-personalised data: This is information that does not identify an individual, because identifiers have been removed or scrambled. However, the information is still about an individual person and so needs to be protected. It might, in theory, be possible to re-identify the individual if the data was not adequately protected, for example if it was combined with different sources of information.



EEncryption: A process of maintaining data integrity and confidentiality by converting plain data into a secret code with the help of an algorithm. The corresponding reverse process is "decryption", a transformation that restores encrypted data to its original form. Only authorized users with a key can decrypt encrypted data. Encryption is regarded as an effective way to defend against the abuse of IT technologies, such as hacking, identity and personal data theft, fraud and the improper disclosure of confidential information. It ensures the protection of cybersecurity, data protection and privacy.



IIdentifiable information: See Personally identifiable data.Identifier: An item of data, which by itself or in combination with other identifiers, enables an individual to be identified.Implied consent: an unwritten agreement between the patient and the health and social care professionals that provide their care that allows their data to be collected, processed and shared as long as it is relevant for their care, that it is kept confidential and the patient has not objected.Indirect care: purposes other than individual care of the patient. This includes activities that contribute to the overall provision of services to a population as a whole or a group of patients with a particular condition. It also covers health services management, preventative medicine, and medical research. Examples of such activities would be risk prediction and stratification, service evaluation, needs assessment, financial audit.Information governance: this is how organisations manage the way that any data is handled within the health and social care system in England. It covers the policy and legal requirements that organisations need to meet to ensure that data is handled legally, securely, efficiently, effectively and in a manner which maintains public trust.



LLinkage: The merging of information or data from two or more sources, with the object of combining facts concerning an individual or an event, which are not available in any separate record.



MMachine learning: A sub-discipline of artificial intelligence, regarding the ability of a software/computer to learn from its environment or from a very large set of representative data, enabling systems to adapt their behaviour to changing circumstances or to perform tasks for which they have not been explicitly programmed.



PPatient data: Data that is collected about a patient whenever they go to a doctor or receive social care. It may include details about the individuals physical or mental health, such as height and weight or detail of any allergies, and their social care needs and services received. It may also include next of kin information.Personally identifiable data: This term describes personal information about identified or identifiable individuals, which should be kept securely and only used for agreed legally approved purposes.Personal data: According to the General Data Protection Regulation, this is data that relates to a living individual who can be identified from this data, or from a combination of this data and other data which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller.Primary care: Primary care refers to services provided by organisations such as GP practices, dental practices, community pharmacies and high street optometrists.Pseudonym: a unique identifier (sometimes created by scrambling an actual identifier), which does not itself reveal an individuals real world identity but distinguishes between different individuals in a data setPseudonymous Data: The process of distinguishing individuals in a data set by using a unique identifier, which does not reveal their real world identity (see also ). ()Public interest: Something in the public interest is something that serves the interests of society as a whole. The public interest test is used to determine whether the benefit of disclosing personally identifiable patient data outweighs both the personal interest of the individual concerned and the need to protect the publics trust in the confidentiality of services.



SSensitive personal data: Data that identifies a living individual regarding his or her: racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health or condition, sexual life, convictions, legal proceedings against the individual or allegations of offences committed by the individual.Study Participant: Any person participating in a research study, whether or not a clinical trial. It can refer to patients or healthy volunteers (it does not include health care professionals).Synthetic data: It is information that's artificially manufactured rather than generated by real-world events. Synthetic data is created algorithmically, and it is used as a stand-in for test datasets of production or operational data, to validate mathematical models and, increasingly, to train machine learning models.

The process of recovery from severe mental ill health is by nature complicated. Like with severe physical ill health, there are often multiple and unknown causes, meaning the process of treatment is rarely straightforward.






































In October 2022, we hosted our very first Data Saves Lives Ambassador Training Bootcamp in Prague, Czech Republic. The purpose was to equip regional and national level organisations with practical tools and tips on how to advocate for and have informed dialogue around health data sharing. This blog gives an insight into the hot topics that were discussed as well as a summary of the key insights.

Read on as a member of the - Gravitate-Health UAG shares experiences of using digital health tools, including thoughts on what aspects work well and not so well from a patients perspective.






































Unfair and systematic differences in healthcare between different demographic groups have led to avoidable health inequalities. The collection of health data gives us the opportunity to address the gaps, but do we really have the full picture?






































Data does save lives, but information quality is paramount to achieve successful outcomes and this, in my experience, cannot be achieved if patients are not full partners and agents in their care, using the right tool to do this.






































This year was really full with news and resources about health data sharing. The European Health Data Space became more and more focused and discussed. Additionally, patients and citizens started to become more interested in health data sharing. Nevertheless, it became clear again that there is a significant need for more information and education around the topic too.






































Often when we buy new shoes, we have to learn to walk in them  a process that is long and sometimes, uncomfortable. If you hadnt walked in my shoes, you wouldnt know what they truly felt like.

Protecting Health Data













73% of EU citizens want to share health data on the precondition that data is secure and only accessible by authorised partiessource: ec.europa.eu/health/Every patient must be able to find out how their data is used and the protections that are in place to keep it secure. The more informed people feel, the more likely they are to support the use of data sharing. So, it is of utmost importance to our initiative to keep peoples health data safe and secure and communicate how we do this to the public.







With data privacy playing a more significant role in both the public conversation and the legal environment with the implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, it is critical to understand how popular views on health data are evolving.
