EHDEN is an IMI2 project. 
EHDENs mission is to reduce the time needed to provide answers in real world, health research. It will achieve this by developing the required infrastructure in a federated network at scale across Europe, collaboration on research methodologies, and education in an open science collaboration.
Data partners (that applied for a grant via an open call) get help from a certified SME to map their data to the OMOP common data model for use in the federated network. 
EHDENs five-year IMI 2 phase will end in 2024. A new legal entity, the EHDEN Foundation, was created in The Netherlands. It will serve to transition the project into a long-term, sustainable operation in 2024  and will facilitate the developing ecosystem, operationalising the research operating model post project, working in parallel on the transition and cross-fade between the project and the EHDEN Foundation.

EHDEN Foundation 




EHDEN Data Partners & SMEs share their aspirations for the EHDEN Foundation











 EHDENs five-year IMI 2 phase will end in 2024. We are proud of the progress of the project to date, achieving beyond our original aims in the build of the Data Partner network, infrastructure development, evidence generation, and education by our midpoint. EHDEN has created a growingcurrently consisting 187 Data Partners in 29 countries across the European region, with greater than 850 million anonymous health records being harmonised to the OMOP common data model. In parallel, 64 small-to-medium-sized enterprises () have been trained across 22 countries, certified andareworking with Data Partners on a consistent data harmonisation process of their source data.
Our evidence-generation work is accelerating and we have contributed to over 70to date, with increasing scientific exposure through international meetings and via. The EHDENhas supported over 4,000 participants with its now 19 courses since its launch, and we continue to expand our educational activities, also via the OHDSI Education Working Group.
For the remainder of the project, we want to leverage these achievements and focus even more on evidence generation. Our vision remains the same: a Europe where harmonised real-world data is used by the healthcare community to more rapidly generate high quality insights that improve outcomes for patients, revolutionising how treatment and care are implemented and evaluated.
Building on EHDENs successes, a new legal entity, the EHDEN Foundation, was createdin The Netherlands. It will serve to transition the project into a long-term, sustainable operation in 2024andwill facilitate the developing ecosystem, operationalising the research operating model post project, working in parallel on the transition and cross-fade between the project and the EHDEN Foundation.
As a sustainable entity, the EHDEN Foundation will continue to promote and foster a strong and growing open science community with Data Partners, SMEs, researchers, public & private, and NGOs. It will also continue to provide research, training certification, and service research in the EHDEN network and wider research community, supporting studies, study-a-thons, methodological and technical developments, and research programmes.
Watch this space for further updates as we develop the EHDEN Foundation and ensure a smooth sustainability path beyond the original EHDEN project  and we look forward to collaborating with many of you in doing so!

Findable, standardised data at scale through the EHDEN Database Catalogue 


EHDEN is building the sociotechnical architecture to facilitate its European federated network and the research workflow from discovery to analysis within the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) principles.
Initially launched within the  is the Data Partner Catalogue, with Network Dashboard, metadata-driven fingerprint profiles and feasibility dashboards, to be followed by the research workflow infrastructure through to standardised analytical pipeline supported by EHDEN and OHDSI, from study idea through to publication.
The Portal will include modules for Study Management, Data Analytics, an Evidence Hub, a Support Servicedesk, and link through to the EHDEN Academy.










The  is the main tool for Data Partners and Researchers, with enrolment, single sign off authentication and approval, to understand who may be relevant and interested in the research query or protocol prior to engaging, contracting, seeking approvals and then running rapid, network analysis, publication, etc., within the open science community wanting to generate high quality evidence.














The development roadmap has been outlined for the modular, iterative, development of the Portal, using feedback also to refine the architecture and user feedback. In parallel a service model is also being developed for long term sustainability of EHDEN and the Portal, network and open science community.
















Do enrol in the , explore the Data Partner Catalogue and Network Dashboard, and feel free to provide us feedback over the coming months, while we execute the roadmap and further build out the Portal. For more guidance on using the Portal, go to Getting Started in the Portal left hand navigation bar once you have an account.

SME Catalogue

EHDENs main objective is to create an EU-wide ecosystem for federated analyses of real world data standardised to the OMOP Common Data Model. To this end, EHDEN has organised open calls for Data Partners to receive financial support for the standardisation of their data, and for SMEs to receive training and become certified to support mapping to the OMOP Common Data Model, and perform services in the ecosystem. This Directory provides an overview of all service providers in this ecosystem.
Here we provide a high-level overview of what is meant with the different services being mentioned in the Directory below.

OHDSI Software and Tools: Installation of the analytical infrastructure, for example the ATLAS tool, and the R packages to perform analyses.
OHDSI Training: Provide training on the OMOP CDM, Standardised Vocabularies, and tools.
OMOP CDM ETL:Creating an Extraction Transform and Loading (ETL) pipeline to transform data from source to the OMOP CDM. This includes defining ETL specificfiations, local vocabulary mappings, coding and testing, etc.
OMOP Standardised vocabularies:Mapping local terminology systems to the Standardised Vocabularies.
Technical infrastructure Services: Commissioning of servers and databases, for example Postgresql, SQL Server, AWS Redshift.

RESEARCH STUDIES

The second E in EHDEN stands for Evidence, and this has been a focus for the project from the start . As EHDEN enters its fourth year and going forward, research work is expanding, which represents EHDENs overarching goal to generate real world evidence that improves health treatments and outcomes for patients across Europe. Here you can find links to the latest EHDEN/OHDSI publications and research/use cases









Use cases are the specific studies conducted in EHDEN as per the agreed Description of Action with IMI to support developments in our Work Packages, expanding to wider use cases to demonstrate and evaluate the efficacy of the EHDEN network of Data Partners, OMOP mapped datasets, OHDSI and EHDEN analytical tools, and methodological improvements in working with real world data at scale across multiple therapeutic areas. They also form the basis for our evidence generation and addressing the second 'e' in EHDEN.










A study-a-thon is a focused process of reducing research studies from years to months and weeks, with a period of intense activity typically in a week with prior preparation and post completion work, incorporating a multidisciplinary team of researchers and Data Partners conducing multisite, international network studies. Study-a-thons are also noteworthy for their transparency of analysis, publications and wider replication, as well as being a training opportunity.










An evidence-a-thon or e-thon is an EHDEN developed process to support Data Partners with newly mapped datasets in the OMOP common data model to replicate prior studies, supporting evaluation of the fidelity of their mapping, but also inception of training in the use of OHDSI and EHDEN analytical tools and study workflow.

Voice of EHDEN - A conversation with Dr Eric Sutherland, Digital Health Lead, OECD, on digital health ecosystems and the three layers of digital tools, integrated data and trusted analysis




We welcome Eric Sutherland, Senior Health Economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which we covered in episode 2 of season 2 with Eric's predecessor, Jillian Oderkirk. Eric spent 20 years with a global bank in the financial sector, but wanted to fulfil his wish to be engaged and find meaning in his work, transitioning to roles locally and federally in health on data strategy. Having worked with the Canadian government on health data strategy development, Eric recently moved to the OECD, in particular focusing on the impact of digital tools and data on health care delivery and outcomes within the overall health ecosystem.
In this conversation we start discussing Eric's definition of digital health, in his new role as Digital Health Lead at the OECD, and recognising there is no universal definition, but with a particular focus on technologies, interoperability and governance, linkage, quality of data, analytics and various intended use of health data. Against a context of incoherent fragmentation, Eric is focused on being able to produce useful guidance for countries to implement integrated digital health ecosystems, based on the three layers of digital tools, integrated data and responsible analytics.
Beyond this Eric outlines what he thinks is working today in digital health, and what's not, using an analogy of water, pipes and outlets to describe this, where we find ourselves too often drowning in data, but thirsting for evidence. Continuing to use this analogy we discuss how this all operates, who is responsible for the different elements, and some best practice use cases, such as OHDSI, or the FAIR principles, with ideas to promote conscious collaboration in making this all work. A lot of what we are trying to do is grow the digital health ecosystem by addressing technical fragmentation; the social, cultural, policy and process challenges; and trustworthiness (as opposed to trust alone).
In the end phase of this conversation, Eric outlines what he thinks are the priorities for Digital Health, with the three layers in mind, and a need for integrated care via multidisciplinary providers supported by integrated data, with a pivot to person-centric versus a facilities-centric philosophy. Inclusivity of new technologies to reduce non-value added tasks and activities while rationalising better data governance and data capture requirements could certainly beneficially impact on the workforce, lowering workloads and enhancing care delivery as one example. And as Eric points out, 'if we want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together'.

Voice of EHDEN - Exploring the concept of trust and health data with Dr Mackenzie Graham




The Voice of EHDEN podcast is pleased to continue our occasional ELSI series, and this is the first episode of season 4, focusing on the concept of 'trust' within the context of health and health research, and in particular real world data. In this episode we are joined by Dr Mackenzie Graham, Senior Research Fellow in Data Ethics, Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities, University of Oxford. Mackenzie has a facinating background in neuroscience, data and data ethics, and also collaborates with Dr Mark Sheehan and Dr Richard Milne, our participants in the first episode of our ELSI series.
In the discussion, we explore what is meant by, 'trust', and also trustworthiness, and reliance on appropriate governance systems to support individuals and patients being confident in who and how they can trust. Within this we investigate underlying concepts that result in trust, what it is and what it takes for trust and trustworthiness, such as motives and prior experience, very much within a motivation-based model.
Beyond this, we focus in on aspects of data use, the role of Tech Titans and trade offs we all make in society around the use of our personal data, through to sociotechnical architectures, e.g., Trusted Research Environments (TREs), federated data networks, like EHDEN, DARWIN EU(R) and the European Health Data Space (EHDS). From this the attributes, roles and actor's responsibilities are articulated, and a delineation of both passive and active activity around trust. Finally, we land on the counter factual concept of 'distrust' and the need to explore this further, especially in the context of health and health data use for research.
Specifically the role of TREs is explored in terms of trust, and Mackenzie and colleagues recently published in the Journal of Medical Ethics on, 'Trust and the Goldacre Review: why trusted research environments are not about trust', available, and speaking to a number of aspects discussed in this episode.
The views expressed by the participants are personal and not necessarily reflective of their organisations.

Community Calls 




Behind the scenes of our Community, there is an important role of management and coordination, from the onboarding of Data Partners and SMEs to the mapping of data to the OMOP CDM and the organisation of the Community Calls. Listen to Montse Camprubi as she explains her role and how the EHDEN Community is growing with time.







EHDEN is very pleased to support our Data Partner and SME community via a bi-monthly call to discuss topics of interest, and for them to share their experiences, learnings and recommendations related to mapping their data to the OMOP Common Data Model, and evidence generation thereafter. The video outputs from some of these calls also provide excellent educational materials for anyone with an interest in these domains, and we are grateful to our collaborators for their permission in making them publicly available.

Webinars 


Introduction to EHDEN: Data Saves Lives Coffee Talk (short intro to the project)




During this "Data Saves Lives' coffee talk, Nigel Hughes introduces you to the EHDEN project and updates you on our achievements to date.








Open call for Data Partners: a guide




In this short webinar, Jennifer Lane provides more information on EHDEN, our open calls for Data Partners and why you should apply!







Open call for SMEs (March 2021)




In this short webinar, Michel van Speybroeck provides provides more information on EHDEN and our open call for SMEs.







The need for health data in the era of Covid-19 (October 2020)




The Covid-19 pandemic underscores the need for high-quality health data that is readily deployed. Europes early epidemiological assessmentsat the start of the pandemicprojected infection and mortality rates by orders of magnitude in error. Once the pandemic was in full swing, official statistics in most European countries underreported coronavirus-related deaths.Morerecently, the retraction of two separate clinical studies for hydroxychloroquine published in two top medical journals due to unreliable primary data collection and meta-analysis demonstrated the importance of data quality for assessing vitally needed medicines. This session will offer distinct perspectives on how to address data problems such as these in the future so as to steer health policy with clarity and minimize negative repercussions on health outcomesbeyond the pandemic.







Determining value for patients and harnessing RWE (October 2020)




With the growing use of regulatory tools such as conditional approvals and breakthrough designations, the traditional bottleneck of regulatory approval is today seen as far less problematic than it was previously. However, the early assessment of new products is also increasingly accompanied by smaller datasets that are often extrapolated for outcomes and survival. This creates enormous challenges for Europes HTA bodies, which need to assess these new treatments based on limited quantities of long-term outcomes data. This session will explore how EHDEN can function as a platform to capture longer-term outcomes data and provide alternative reimbursement and assessment approaches to facilitate comparative effectiveness measures.







What could the pharma industry look like by 2030? (October 2020)




Science is leading us down the path of increasingly targeted medicines with accompanying advances in genomics and our ability to develop personalised therapies for patients. However, there are increasing challenges in the development of drugs for ever smaller populations since, by definition, the rarer a disease is, the fewer people there are with the disorder that can participate in clinical research. EHDEN and other GDPR-compliant data-sharing platforms provide an alternative approach to drug development that enables researchers to search millions of historical anonymous patient records to model different scenarios and health personas, and to accelerate the development of medicines currently not available to patients in need. This session will provide an overview ofRCT-alternativeapproaches, as well as explore the potential application ofmachine learning within the clinical trials domain.







Evidence generation for HTA: what role for the OMOP Common Data Model and EHDEN? (January 2020)






Most countries in Europe have formal #health technology assessment processes to inform clinical practice and/or the coverage and reimbursement of new medical technologies. Some bodies focus on the relative effectiveness of technologies, while others additionally assess #cost-effectiveness, i.e. are any additional costs justified by the additional benefits? Because HTA bodies are typically interested in the long-term (usually lifetime) impact of technologies in clinical practice, clinical trials alone are not sufficient to inform decisions, and modelling is often required. 

Models are data hungry, usually requiring data on disease prevalence, natural disease history, treatment utilisation, long-term effectiveness and safety, health-related quality of life, and healthcare utilisation. It can be challenging to find and access datasets containing all appropriate data and using multiple datasets requires analysts to be familiar with the structure and coding of each, and to develop separate analysis scripts. As such, the federated data network which EHDEN aims to develop and the OMOP common data model (#OMOP-CDM) and associated tools (through the OHDSI network) have the potential to alleviate some of these challenges. In this webinar, we discuss the uses of HTA, the challenges of evidence generation for HTA, and think about how the OMOP-CDM, #OHDSI tools, and the EHDEN network can support such evidence generation, how these tools and networks could be further developed to better support HTA, and where challenges are likely to remain in the future.









Reducing cancer deaths and complications by leveraging OMOP and OHDSI (September 2019)

 Surgery is the major treatment option for #colorectal #cancer, which today is the third most common form of cancer worldwide. However, understanding when and how to apply surgery, in combination with drugs, radiotherapy and other medical treatment options, is an ongoing field of research. 
In this webinar, Ismail Ggenur, director of the Center for Surgical Science at Zealand University Hospital in Denmark, will explain how his team is utilising the #OMOP Common Data Model and the #OHDSI tools to achieve a holistic view on the risk profile and treatment options for colorectal cancer patients. While earlier webinars focused on the EHDEN project, the OMOP CDM itself and ways to generate medical #evidence, this one will focus on arguably the most impactful aspect: using OMOP, OHDSI and EHDEN to make better decisions in clinical practice, reducing mortality and complications by the smart use of medical data at scale.




The future of primary care research in Catalonia (July 2019)

In this installment of the EHDEN webinar series, Kees van Bochove invited Talita Duarte Salles and Leonardo Mendez Boo from SIDIAP (www.sidiap.org) to discuss their journey of adopting the OMOP CDM. This webinar discussed SIDIAP's journey and how they benefited from adopting OMOP.




EHDEN - 21st Century Real World Open Science (July 2019)

In this webinar of the EHDEN webinar series, Peter Rijnbeek (Erasmus Medical Center) and Nigel Hughes (Janssen Pharmaceutica) discuss the European Health Data & Evidence Network. They explain the scope and objectives of EHDEN and how they believe EHDEN will transform the way real-world evidence is being generated. Additionally, the open call processes is explained and in particular, how SMEs and data sources can both contribute and benefit from EHDEN.




From question to publication in 5 days (March 2019)

In this 1st webinar of the EHDEN webinar series, Kees van Bochove (TheHyve) and Daniel-Prieto Alhambra (University of Oxford) will discuss the EHDEN and OHDSI Study-a-thon which was organized at the University of Oxford in December 2018. They will explain the concept of this 5-day meeting and how they were able to go from question, to cohort characterization, to data analysis and ultimately to evidence generation in only 5 days.

BLOG  New HTA Courses now available on EHDEN Academy 
25th April 2024 







As part of our commitment to education, we at the EHDEN Academy are pleased to share our new HTA track of courses, curated by our partner NICE and developed by leading experts. These courses are designed to empower healthcare professionals, researchers, and policy-makers with the tools and knowledge needed to drive innovation and efficiency in healthcare.
Our first course, Introduction to Health Technology Assessment, serves as a foundational step through the journey to understand the processes and principles that underpin HTA. This course, developed with input from NICEs Science Policy and Research programme and NICE International, explains the critical role of HTA in balancing clinical and cost-effectiveness with patient outcomes. Its an essential resource for anyone looking to understand how healthcare technologies are evaluated and integrated into health systems.
The second course was developed by Professor Jeroen Jansen (Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of California  San Francisco), Applied Cost-Effectiveness Modelling with R, offers a deep dive into the economic evaluation of health technologies using the statistical software R. This course is particularly tailored for those interested in the quantitative aspects of HTA, providing hands-on experience in building and analysing cost-effectiveness models. Whether you are a health economist or a data scientist, this course will enhance your ability to contribute to more informed healthcare decisions.
Lastly, our third course, Assessing Healthcare Using Outcomes That Matter to Patients, is developed by our partner International Consortium of Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM). This course is designed to shift the focus of healthcare assessment towards outcomes that truly matter to patients, where learners are guided through the importance of patient-reported outcomes in achieving value-based healthcare.
All Academy courses are free and accessible online, enabling learners to benefit from this knowledge at their own pace. These courses are not only informational but also interactive, featuring assessments and practical case studies to ensure a comprehensive learning experience. In addition to gaining a solid grounding in HTA, economic modelling, and patient-centred outcomes directly from experts, they will ones ability to impact and apply the knowledge and tools from these courses to influence healthcare decisions effectively.
Patrick Ryan, EHDEN Project Co-Lead, VP at Janssen R&D, Assistant Professor at Columbia, and Collaborator with OHDSI, noted, Theres a huge potential to expand the use of reliable real-world evidence for health technology assessment. We are proud of EHDENs collaborations with NICE, ICHOM and the University of California  San Francisco, and excited by their development of new EHDEN Academy courses that allow for all stakeholders to learn more and identify new opportunities for community collaboration.

BLOG  Federated data networks and health technology assessment: Insights from an EHDEN study-a-thon in oncology 
19th March 202418th March 2024 







In January, the National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE), University of Oxford and Fundaci Institut Universitari per a la Recerca a l'Atenci Primria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol) collaboratively held a study-a-thon in Barcelona. This event brought together Data Partners and oncology experts to utilise real-world data (RWD) for advancements in oncology research, with a particular emphasis on cancer survival and extrapolation for health technology assessment (HTA).








Figure 1: Study-a-thon attendees including the project team and Data Partner representatives at IDIAPJGol in Barcelona




The study-a-thon was structured around key objectives, namely:

the development of a dashboard that enables users to select a database from a dropdown menu and explore survival extrapolations for eight different cancers, with options for age and sex stratifications,
the description of overall survival across multiple cancers and data sources,
and the comparison of long-term versus predicted survival for these cancers.

Even with the unexpected curveball of a nurses' strike on our second day (to which we extend our solidarity!), the study-a-thon didn't skip a beat. After three days filled with engaging, multidisciplinary discussions, all thirteen Data Partners successfully ran the study. This effort culminated in two conference abstracts and two manuscripts in development. Additionally, a fully developed oncology dashboard was created for HTA, enhancing the practicality of our findings.
The collaborative spirit and dedication of all participants were crucial to the study-a-thon's success. These productive and inspiring few days highlight the critical role of continued collaboration among Data Partners to improve our understanding of cancer survival across Europe. The dissemination of our findings will make a substantial contribution to the field of oncology research, leading the way for more informed healthcare decisions based on real-world evidence. Looking ahead, further developments in our analyses will enable tools like the dashboard to become utilised in HTA.









Figure 2: Cancer survival dashboard developed for this study-a-thon. On the left-hand side there are dropdown menus that allow users to select which dataset they are using, as well as which cancer they are reviewing. The plot shows the observed Kaplan-Meier data and extrapolations fit to it.

Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Study-A-Thon 
12th March 2024 







Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a silent public health issue, impacting health and quality of life of millions of women across the globe. Diagnosis and treatment are often delayed, with up to 54% of women with HMB never receiving either. To address this, a two-day study-a-thon was held with eleven EHDEN Data Partners (DPs) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands on 11-12 December 2023. More than 350 million anonymous health data records were analysed for this study.
The primary objectives of the study were to:

Characterise women of reproductive age diagnosed with HMB (demographics, parity and reproductive history, comorbidities, comedications and procedures).
Describe treatment pathways of women of reproductive age diagnosed with HMB across different countries and data sources (duration of use, switch to other treatments).

Secondary objectives of the study included describing both the incidence and proportion of women diagnosed with HMB (calendar year over study period: 2000-2020), and the country-specific, guideline-compliant treatment use where national treatment guidelines are available for HMB.
Specifically for the study-a-thon, objectives were to:

Discuss the interpretation of the results and the key messages.
Provide a holistic interpretation of the results, including understanding of the key characteristics of the DPs and how these affect the interpretability of the results.
Strengthen knowledge-sharing between more experienced DPs and DPs for which this was the first study using their data converted to the OMOP-Common Data Model.




"HMB is still a longstanding and overlooked condition. We expect the final results will help raise HMB awareness and improve treatment for patients. Were confident it will serve to reinforce the value of collaborative efforts in addressing women's health issues globally."
Marta Pineda MoncusiPostdoctoral Health Data Scientist, Pharmaco- and Device Epidemiology Group, NDORMS, University of Oxford
This study aimed to improve the understanding of HMB using real world data from different countries across a broad spectrum of healthcare settings. The study-a-thon was well attended and proved to be an effective and time-saving way to enhance and facilitate the exchange of knowledge from different expertise areas."
