Let's talk



























A robust platform that converts different types of hospital and patient data into real-world evidence



We prepare and pre-validate data and harmonise them to a common data model with a low burden for hospitals.














Join once
Legal matters and data collection should not be part of individual treatment improvement projects. They should be done once and for all, giving back time and pace to the projects. ARWEN makes this a reality.





THE ARWEN DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT
Our legal framework guarantee hospitals keep full ownership of their data. This eliminates the need to go through this legal process with each new project.










benefit continuously
Particpants dont need to go through data setup processes for each new project.Join more meaningful treatment improvement projects faster.

INVOLVED HOSPITALS HAVE ACCESS TO ALL RELEVANT INSIGHTS THAT COME OUT OF THE TREATMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
In ARWEN projects, project outcomesare shared with all the members involved. This makes your participation in ARWEN more rewarding.









What real-world data is supported?





OUR CORE DATA SETS
The core data sets represent the backbone of every ARWEN analytics project. They allow us to identify and structure the granular medical activities, care pathways, medicines prescriptions, clinical outcomes and more.



Claims and care activity data

This essential data set includes patient-level granular data on the single activities performed to treat patients, such as operations, hospitalisation time, diagnostics, consultations, etc.
Clustering and sequencing these activities allow, for instance, to generate of real-world patient pathways.



Prescription data
Pharmacy data provides detail on the types, dosage and volumes of drugs prescribed.


CROs
Clinician-Reported Outcomes include different types of quality indicators, such as reoperation rates, complications, time to next treatment, etc.








ADD-ON DATA SETS
These data sets are optional layers that can enhance the core ones. They can be utilised for specific study protocols and typically require advanced data models.



PROs
Patient Reported Outcomes refer to condition-specific indicators on the patient physical and mental status.


Pathology & lab data
While the occurrence of specific pathology & lab tests is included in the care activity data, this data sets discloses details on the results of pathology exams, such as blood tests, urinalysis, molecular pathology and more.


Other diagnostics data
While the occurrence of specific diagnostics is included in the care activity data, this data sets gives clarity on the results of additional diagnostic exams, such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans and more.


Genomics data
DNA data can be crossed with other data sets to enable advanced insights on gene-based patient segmentation and support the discovery and development of precision therapy practices and medicines.








At LOGEX, we are expert data handlers and analysists

We have structured and routinised tools and practices for data extraction, linkage and validation
During the process of validation, data is thoroughly reviewed ensure its validity and prepare it for use

Frequently asked questions









What is the added value of being a member of ARWEN?


ARWEN makes your real-world data (RWD) more actionable: generating insights in a way that s fast, scalable and transparent. With ARWEN collecting, standardising and analysing RWD for treatment improvement projects is no longer a struggle.







What does actionable mean in ARWEN?


Actionable means you can act upon the insights we provide. They answer your questions about how to improve the care of your patients.







Is there an investment needed from members?


There is no investment needed from the hospitals. Hospitals can join for free and benefit continuously.







How does this bring value to patients?


ARWEN allows hospitals to get answers to their own specific questions in the treatment improvement projects they participate in. This helps hospitals to identify improvement potential in their care to patients. Besides that, hospitals and clinicians can compare their own care to that of a benchmark. On top of that, ARWEN members get access to regular useful insight reports and international best practices that can help them improve the care they provide to patients.







Is ARWEN owned or funded by the pharmaceutical industry?


No. ARWEN was founded by LOGEX after seeing the barriers that hold many healthcare providers back when trying to apply RWE to improve care. LOGEX believes it can help remove these barriers whilst remaining a trusted and impartial third party. That is why it chose to fund the start-up of ARWEN entirely independently.







Who controls the patient data?


The hospital is always the data controller, in compliance with GDPR terms. ARWEN ensures continuous control of hospitals on your data:

Your data is yours  ARWEN is not a data broker
Your data is safe  The privacy and security of your data always comes first
Your data is valuable  ARWEN provides clear and transparent financial benefits
Your data is vital  We are proud to support your ambition to help fast-track crucial research








Will the hospitals patient data be shared with pharmaceutical clients?


Patient-level data will not be shared. We are GDPR compliant, so only with the explicit permission of the hospital aggregated anonymised data can be shared. For most projects, only population level data is required. For sharing aggregated anonymised data at the hospital level, additional permission is always needed.







How are patient data protected against cyber crime?


ARWEN is powered by LOGEX. An industry-leading healthcare analytics company. LOGEX deploys data security and privacy by design. Our dedicated information security office monitors security procedures in-depth, assuring your data is safe and secure. In addition, we support multiple user authorisation levels to control the privacy and transparency of your data.
We are fully GDPR compliant and ISO27001 certified.







Does ARWEN sell anonymised data to third parties?


ARWEN does not sell anonymised data. ARWEN ensures continuous control of your data. ARWEN is not a data broker.







What happens with the data once LOGEX analyses it?


The Data Processing Agreement (DPA) specifies the data retention period.







What types of data are required?


To obtain a longitudinal view of patients, we require at least three years of routine healthcare data- collected in all hospitals. This includes prescription data, medical procedures, and diagnosis codes (usually expressed as ICD10-codes).
Complex RWE treatment improvement projectsARWEN aims to enable complex RWE treatment improvement projects and programmes. Additional data sources such as pathology, laboratory, imaging, and clinical outcomes are collected and linked to fully understand patient treatment and outcomes.







Why did LOGEX initiate ARWEN?


At LOGEX, we have worked for hospitals since 2008. In the past years, we have supported the extraction and analytics of RWD in local and international initiatives. For example, standards of care, the impact of COVID, patient pathway optimisation. We believe that collecting, standardising and analysing data to participate in more RWE treatment improvement projects should not have to be a struggle; that is why we have founded ARWEN.

Europe






RSV Observatory
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a frequent cause of seasonal acute respiratory infection (ARI). The impact of RSV on healthcare is likely to be underestimated and there are significant knowledge gaps around RVS. During this project, data on the diagnostics and treatment of RSV are gathered from hospitals across Europe. The ultimate goal is to, by analysing these data, looking at relevant variations between hospitals and countries and identifying the impact of those differences on RSV therapy outcomes and costs, reach actionable insights to improve the care for RSV patients.

Psoriasis Observatory
There are currently many advancements in how psoriasis is being and can be treated. Novel treatments modulating the inflammatory pathways in psoriasis have been introduced, and several biosimilars of TNFi drugs are being introduced. This could impact pathways, clinical outcomes and costs. 
This diversity in treatment could lead to unclarity on what is the best choice in which case, on what outcomes are to be expected with what specific care path and what the associated cost will be. 
To gather information on the treatment of psoriasis across European hospitals, we have established the Psoriasis Observatory. The aim is to analyse the gathered data and use the insights to characterise the psoriasis care pathways and their changes over time. We also intend to analyse variations in care approaches between hospitals and countries, as well as identify the impact of different care pathways on psoriasis therapy outcomes and costs.
