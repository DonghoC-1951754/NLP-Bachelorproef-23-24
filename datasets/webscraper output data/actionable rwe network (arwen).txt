Platform for RWE projects (RWD!)
for hospitals (data owners)
prepare, validate, anonymise and harmonise data
project outcomes are shared with all members involved
ARWEN is committed to build a European data network

ARWEN makes your real-world data (RWD) more actionable: generating insights in a way that s fast, scalable and transparent. With ARWEN collecting, standardising and analysing RWD for treatment improvement projects is no longer a struggle.

They should be done once and for all, giving back time and pace to the projects. ARWEN makes this a reality.THE ARWEN DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENTOurlegal frameworkguarantee hospitals keep full ownership of their data. This eliminates the need to go through this legal process with each new project.…benefit continuouslyParticpants don’t need to go through data setup processes for each new project.Join more meaningful treatment improvement projects faster.1WE SUPPORT BETTER HEALTHCARE WITH DATA ANALYTICSWeprepare, validate, anonymise and harmonise datafrom multiple disease groups to a common model for efficient analysis of the data. This allows us to deliver ready-to-use Real-World Evidence, with a minimal burden for your hospital.ARWEN members can elect to participate intreatment improvement projects, while we support them in answering their own questions through data analytics.We have 15+ years of experience with hospital data. Our scalabledata modelsbring together patient pathway mapping, medicines uptake, clinical & patient outcomes, activity-based costs and more.2OUR PROJECT PROTOCOL ARE SHAPED IN COOPERATIONWe propose a continuously evolving selection of focal therapeutic areas. We connect ARWEN partners from the healthcare and life science worlds who want to answer key questions and stimulate informed decision-making.For each treatment improvement project, we involve suitable groups of healthcare providers that want to participate, based on their hospital profiles and therapeutic focus. This way, we ensure the projects lead to meaningful results that are relevant for everyone involved.3INVOLVED HOSPITALS HAVE ACCESS TO ALL RELEVANT INSIGHTS THAT COME OUT OF THE TREATMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECTSIn ARWEN projects, project outcomes are shared with all the members involved. This makes your participation in ARWEN more rewarding.Whatreal-worlddata is supported?OUR CORE DATA SETSThe core data sets represent the backbone of every ARWEN analytics project. They allow us to identify and structure the granular medical activities, care pathways, medicines prescriptions, clinical outcomes and more.Claims and care activity dataThis essential data set includes patient-level granular data on the single activities performed to treat patients, such as operations, hospitalisation time, diagnostics, consultations, etc.Clustering and sequencing these activities allow, for instance, to generate of real-world patient pathways.Prescription dataPharmacy data provides detail on the types, dosage and volumes of drugs prescribed.CROsClinician-Reported Outcomes include different types of quality indicators, such as reoperation rates, complications, time to next treatment, etc.ADD-ON DATA SETSThese data sets are optional layers that can enhance the core ones. They can be utilised for specific study protocols and typically require advanced data models.PROsPatient Reported Outcomes refer to condition-specific indicators on the patient physical and mental status.Pathology & lab dataWhile the occurrence of specific pathology & lab tests is included in the care activity data, this data sets discloses details on the results of pathology exams, such as blood tests, urinalysis, molecular pathology and more.Other diagnostics dataWhile the occurrence of specific  diagnostics is included in the care activity data, this data sets gives clarity on the results of additional diagnostic exams, such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans and more.Genomics dataDNA data can be crossed with other data sets to enable advanced insights on gene-based patient segmentation and support the discovery and development of precision therapy practices and medicines.At LOGEX, we are expert data handlers and analysists…We have structured and routinised tools and practices for data extraction, linkage and validationDuring the process of validation, data is thoroughly reviewed ensure its validity and prepare it for useFor all LOGEX client hospitals, they are already validated, structured and processed, allowing to limit effort and cut execution times… continuously working to bring you more data sources.We have experience across a wide range of data-sets, from clinical registries to patient-level financial dataEach study will be based on a set of core data set and, on optional add-on data setsWhoowns the datain ARWENData governance is really important for us: data will always belong to hospitals.Your data is yoursYou are not our product, and neither is your data.We are data analysts, not data brokerYour data is safeThe privacy and security of your data always comes first.We hold ourselves to the same standards as you doYour data is valuableHow you unlock the value in your data, is your choice.We work to turn data into value, in full transparencyYour data is vitalYour data holds the potential to fast-track crucial research.We are proud to be a highly respected & trusted third partyHow doesthe ARWEN data modelwork?Differently from clinical trials, real-world data is not perfect and presents large variations across providers, regions and countries.As ARWEN is committed to build a comparable European data network, robust data models and policies must be established.Well-designed data specifications, a thorough validation process and smart algorithms utilised by ARWEN can turn the complexity of real-world data into tangible insights.Becoming a member of ARWEN takesonly two months.Let’s talkSign up for the newsletterPlease enter your email below to sign up for the newsletter.Your email addressPrivacy statementARWEN is powered byThis website uses functional cookies that are necessary for the operation of the website.
