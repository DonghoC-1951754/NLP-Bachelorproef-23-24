The Research Environment


Our secure Research Environment provides approved researchers with a range of open source tools, shared storage drives, databases and research platforms linking genomic data to a rich set of clinical, phenotypic and longitudinal data.
























Enabling scientific discovery and accelerating it into patient care


All analysis on the Genomics England dataset happens within a secure, cloud workspace called the Research Environment.
To access the data, researchers must first apply to become a member of either the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (academics, students, and clinicians) or the Discovery Forum (industry partners).
Members will always have access to the most up-to-date research dataset and will be able to run analyses on the Genomics England high-performance compute cluster. 






Features:








Virtual desktop environment full of the most up-to-date genomic and clinical data







Wiki-based platform and chat facility for communication with other researchers







Access to the Genomics England high-performance AWS compute cluster







Command-line tools are available for you to perform analysis















What is the Research Environment and how is it used?


This short video explains what the Genomics England Research Environment is, how genomic data is de-identified and added to the Research Environment, and how researchers can access this de-identified data to inform their genomic research.




















What you'll be able to access


Data within the Research Environment currently contains the following types of de-identified information:

Shape the future of personalised medicine


Join us to solve some of the most challenging issues facing healthcare and science.












































Make an impact


Every decision, every line of code and every meeting matters. Our work changes patients' lives, shapes the future of genomic research and enables the treatments of tomorrow. 
We're passionate about what we do because our efforts make a difference.












Work where healthcare, technology, science, and policy meet


To embrace an ever-changing industry, we work in multi-disciplinary teams who collaboratively design and build the services we provide to NHS colleagues and the research and biotech community. 
Were agile, fast-moving, and innovative, and were evolving to reflect the rich diversity of the communities we serve.
Our products and services are complex and need to fit into the lives of our users. To do this better, we use design and social science research to ask the right questions and develop the right outcomes.




























Accelerate healthtech


As we move into creating better decision support systems, stronger bioinformatics pipelines, new clinician and patient interfaces, and savvy environments for our data, we're naturally experimenting with how we apply machine learning, HPC and other technologies in product and service development. 
Ultimately, we're creating new healthcare ecosystems that will tailor diagnosis and treatment to the individual.




























Have your voice heard


We encourage a high challenge and high support culture, and each year do a survey to collect and canvas everyone's views. From this, we do regular pulse surveys to check in and continue to focus on what's most important to our people.








































































Our virtues











Speed


We take an agile and iterative approach to everything  not just software development  seeking to share and get input constantly.











Empathy


Patients are the priority, so we ensure quality and relevance in our outputs, and put their interests ahead of our own.











Curiosity


We aim to think big, always asking questions and experimenting, while learning from evidence and experience.











Integrity


As responsible stewards of patient data, were transparent with each other and our partners.











Focus


Attention to detail is crucial in day-to-day work to limit errors and prioritise what's important.











Impact


We deliver long-term, real-world outcomes for patients, the NHS, and our partners.











Connection


Collaboration is essential  with the UK health system, partners, the global tech and life sciences community, and each other.



























Working at Genomics England can be pretty hectic, but this means that there is real license to shape what you do and how you do it. Ive always been encouraged to take ownership of a piece of work which has allowed me to learn new skills and develop new talents that I might not have got if my role was a bit more structured.


















Dr Simon Thompson


Data Engineer















When I first joined Genomics England we were a project trying to achieve something that had not been done before. Now as we mature as a long-term organisation it is a really exciting time to be part of Genomics England, as we underpin our products and services with solid engineering practice and organise ourselves around cross functional teams to best support these products and services
For people coming into this field, Id say that you need to plan to iterate  to explore and be open to different approaches and technologies but plan how to detect that an approach is not working and move on quickly.


















Nathan Hicks


Software Engineering Manager















The best part of this job is talking to the participants who are just wonderful  thoughtful, practical, insightful, clever and hilarious to be with. I do many talks and debates, and always love the questions, especially from kids. And I like bringing together the many different strands of my life in order to help deliver the vision of genomics.


















Vivienne Parry


Head of Engagement















When the opportunity came up to work for Genomics England, I didnt look back; it is comforting to know that as a company we are all doing something really important to bring benefits to patients now, and are providing the answers to long outstanding medical questions. It brings it home when I get the opportunity to speak to participants who really want members of their family or themselves to get the best medical treatment, and just get better. So, after all these years I finally took the logical next step  Im once again helping people in such an important way.

Genomic Medicine


We're working in partnership with NHS England and the NHS Genomic Medicine Service to develop a personalised and predictive healthcare solution through the use of genomics.












































What is genomic medicine?


Genomic medicine uses insights from a human's complete set of DNA (called a genome) to inform their healthcare.
But because people are very different, studying a genome by itself can't tell you very much. To make sense of it, it's essential to know much more about the person and their health, as well as their DNA.
Genomic medicine combines these two elements, using the science of genomics alongside information about a person's health to improve diagnosis and treatment.





















At Genomics England, we partner with the NHS to provide platforms that enable genomics to be used to diagnose more accurately, treat more effectively, or even spot conditions before symptoms appear.









How is genomic data gathered?


Anyone who is offered whole genome sequencing as part of their care in the  is asked to consent to having their genome sequence and health data and/or their sample (blood/saliva/tissue, etc.), accessible for research. It's your choice.
If you agree, your samples will be stored securely and your data will be added to the National Genomic Research Library, a secure national database of de-identified genomic and health data managed by us. 












80%


of rare diseases are linked to differences in DNA






120K+


whole genomes sequenced






90%


of patients choose for their data to be used for genomic research












What can genomics do for healthcare?


Studying the genomes of many thousands of people allows doctors and scientists to find patterns in the data. By combining those patterns with health data they can pinpoint individual risks of disease, deliver definitive diagnoses and select the treatments that work best.






Personalised medicine















By giving us a window into the molecular differences between people, genomic medicine allows us to pinpoint individual risk of disease and response to treatment.





Fast and accurate diagnosis















Genetic biomarker databases such as ours can reduce genomic testing to a single analysis and deliver a definitive diagnosis more quickly.





Preventative medicine















Genomic testing helps clinicians assess for various conditions earlier (sometimes before any symptoms have presented), and provide their patients with appropriate treatment or preventative interventions.











History of genomics









History of genomics


The UK has a strong history in genomics from Watson and Cricks discovery of DNA to the invention of DNA sequencing. The NHS has been undertaking genomic testing for decades and there has been significant government and NHS investments to support continued progress. 
In 1990, an international consortium of researchers launched the Human Genome Project with the goal of sequencing the first whole human genome. The programme was completed in 2003 and yielded the discovery that there are approximately 20,500 human genes, of which 95% were a mystery.
On the back of that discovery, along with advances in technology, researchers set out to sequence and study more genomes in order to understand the role genes play in health and disease. In the UK, in 2012, this programme was called the 100,000 Genomes Project, which marked the birth of Genomics England to lead and coordinate the research.







How we work at Genomics England









How we work at Genomics England


Genomic medicine uses an individual's genomic information as part of their clinical care. Advances in science and technology, along with collaboration with the NHS Genomic Medicine Service (GMS), provides a unique way to integrate genomic medicine into routine care.
Here at Genomics England, we focus on developing analytical and IT systems that support the NHS to sequence whole genomes from patients (and their family members) with common cancers and rare diseases. The data we generate provides clinicians with more accuracy in diagnosing medical conditions and allows them to target therapies more precisely to their patients.







What's next for genomics









What's next for genomics


Ten years ago, it might have sounded like a fantasy to suggest that we would one day be able to develop individualised therapies, but both the advances in genomic sequencing and the introduction of the NHS Genomic Medicine Service (GMS) now make these claims a reality.
Using the genomic information we curate, the NHS GMS has already established early clinical conditions for whole genome sequencing, with future plans for more. They're also developing tests for another 120 cancer conditions and non-whole genome sequencing testing to include over 300 rare diseases.
Collectively, these advanced services will help eliminate the variables of 'trial-and-error' prescription and provide a significant new resource in transforming healthcare for the NHS.

The fabric of all of us


An introduction to genomes


Your genome is the instructions for making and maintaining you. It is written in a chemical code called DNA. All living things  plants, bacteria, viruses and animals  have a genome.
Find out more about how your genome works in this short video by Great Ormond Street Hospital.





















The building blocks of genomes


Your genome is all 3.2 billion letters of your DNA. It contains around 20,000 genes. 
Genes are the instructions for making the proteins our bodies are built of  from the keratin in hair and fingernails to the antibody proteins that fight infection.
Genes make up about 1-5% of your genome. The rest of the DNA, between the genes, used to be called junk DNA. It wasnt thought to be important. But we now know that DNA between genes actually regulates the genes and the genome. And there is still much more to learn about what it all does. 
That's where genomics comes in. 
Genomics looks at the complete genome  that is, all of your DNA from genes to 'junk'  to get a fuller picture of how it can affect our health. 



























Genomics dictionary


Use this quick guide to learn the definitions of some key genomics terms






DNA









DNA


DNA (deoxyribose nucleic acid) is a long molecule. It has a twisted, double helix shape. DNA is made up of four different chemicals, or bases. These are represented by the letters A, T, C and G. The bases are attached to two phosphate backbones. The bases are paired together; A with T, G with C. The two backbones twist around each other to give the characteristic double helix.
As well as being helix shaped, DNA is tightly packed so it takes up less space. If you stretched the DNA in one cell all the way out, it would be about 2m long.






Genes









Genes


Amongst the 3 billion letters of DNA in your genome are 20,000 genes. These make up about 2% of the sequence.
Genes carry the information that determines your traits  the features or characteristics that are passed on to you from your parents. The DNA in a gene spells out specific instructions for making proteins in the cell. Proteins are the building blocks for everything in your body.






Genome sequencing









Genome sequencing


Sequencing is a technique that is used to read DNA. It finds the order of the letters of DNA (A, T, C and G), one by one.
Sequencing a human genome means finding the sequence of someones unique 3 billion letters of DNA.
There are different methods and machines that can sequence genomes. DNA is sequenced by our partners at Illumina. One human genome can be sequenced in about a day, though the analysis takes much longer.






Reads









Reads


Current DNA sequencing machines cannot sequence the whole genome in one go. Instead, they sequence the DNA in short pieces, around 150 letters long. Each of these short sequences is called a read.
Technology is currently being developed to allow for 'long-reads' of DNA. As the name suggests, we'll be able to 'read' a much longer section of DNA, which can give us a better understanding of how it all fits together.






Reference genome sequence









Reference genome sequence


Reads from a sequencing machine are matched to a reference genome sequence. 
The reference sequence is used by scientists world-wide. It is a representative example of a human genome sequence. It is made up of DNA sequences from 13 anonymous donors, so is not any single person. The reference sequence was the result of the original , which finished in 2001.
The position of most of our genes is known, and is shown on the reference sequence. The next step is to identify the differences between your genome and the reference.






Mapping









Mapping


 Using the 'reference genome sequence', high performance computers use 'mapping' software to find where each read belongs on the genome. 
This process helps discover any variants between your genome and the reference genome.






Variants









Variants


Every person has millions of differences to the reference sequence. The differences are called variants. These might be a single letter. Or a string of letters may be in a different place or missing. 
Most of the differences are completely harmless  they are the reason we are different from each other. Some differences could be causing a disease. Scientists use a range of software to filter millions of differences down to just a few that could be harmful.






Bioinformatics









Bioinformatics


Bioinformatics is the science of collecting and analysing complex biological data, such as genomic data. 
Bioinformaticians are scientists who specialise in analysing genomic or other biological data. They develop methods and software tools to understand and interpret.

Why sequence a genome?


Learning more about genomes can help us to identify the cause of genetic diseases.
Some rare diseases are caused by as little as a single change (variant), like a spelling mistake, in someones DNA. Looking at the genome of a person affected by a rare disease can help find which DNA changes might be causing the problem.
In cancer, the tumour cells have developed a different genome to the healthy cells. Comparing the normal and cancer genomes may give clues about ways to treat the cancer.
For some patients, knowing more about their genome may mean that a particular treatment can be recommended.
When the genome sequences of patients with the same condition are compared, it is possible to see patterns. These patterns can be put together with health information. Once this is done we may be able to link particular patterns with whether people are likely to become ill and, if so, how severe their illness is likely to be.












Understanding genomics

How sequencing a genome works











1. Test offered


Patients with specific medical conditions may be offered a genomic DNA test via the NHS Genomic Medicine Service.











2. Sample gathered


If they consent, their DNA is extracted from a sample (blood, tissue, or skin) in an NHS laboratory and loaded onto a sequencing machine.











3. Sample sequenced


The machine determines the sequence of short pieces of DNA, 150 letter long, called 'reads'.











4. Sequence mapped


The 'reads' from the machine are matched to a reference sequence. This is called 'mapping'.











5. Variants analysed


'Variants' in the DNA are analysed by bioinformaticians and narrowed down to just a handful that could be harmful.











6. NHS receives list of variants


These handful of variants are fed back to the NHS laboratory, whose scientists look through the list of variants and compare them to a patients symptoms and health data. 











7. NHS confirms results


Any findings are given to the patients clinician. If a variant is confirmed to be the cause of a condition, diagnosis and implications are discussed with the patient.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is the process of reading a person's entire genetic code. It adds new dimensions to patient diagnosis and treatment and unlocks more information than conventional standard of care genetic testing. This can aid in making diagnoses and tailoring treatments for patients.
Here you'll find information for clinicians about whole genome sequencing in the NHS, as well as resources to help discuss WGS with patients.













Pediatric oncologist Jack Bartram highlights how WGS has greatly helped his patients.











Whole genome sequencing in the NHS


WGS is a type of genomic test available in the . Clinicians in the NHS can request WGS for patients with certain rare disease indications or cancers, to help inform their care.
WGS in the NHS GMS involves a patient consent process. You can find .
This includes a conversation between clinician and patient that covers both the clinical implications of the test, as well as an option for the patient to make their data and samples available to researchers in the .

Genomics England's role in whole genome sequencing


Genomics England works with NHS England, the  and our sequencing partner Illumina to undertake whole genome sequencing and analyse the results.
These results are then fed back through regional networks of  and on to clinical care.
We also securely store that genomic information (with patients' consent) in the National Genomic Research Library, and make it available for research.

Cancer 2.0





















Cancer 2.0





Cancer 2.0


Exploring long-read sequencing technology and multimodal data to support earlier, faster diagnosis of cancer.

























The next evolution in cancer technology and research


Since the launch of the , researchers and clinicianshave partnered with Genomics England to collect and analysegenomicand long-term clinical data(from health records) to gain insight into the nature of genetic changes that drive cancer evolution.
In the next step of our cancer programme, we are exploring two new technologies for the clinic and research: long-read sequencing and multi-modal data.






















Aims of the initiative











Support better patient outcomes


Shorten the time it takes to receive accurate diagnostic results for the 300,000+ people diagnosed with cancer per year.











Help clinicians deliver personalised treatments


Explore the potential of sequencing technology to better support clinicians with their patient treatment decisions.











Create a world-class research asset for the UK


Make the country's genomic data richer by combining imaging, genomic, and clinical data for researchers to generate new insights into cancer.















What is multimodal data?


Cancer reveals itself to scientists in many different ways: as molecular features in the genome, at a very small scale in pathology images, and at a larger scale in radiology images like MRI and CT scans. In the past, these disciplines of genomics, pathology, and radiology have been very siloed and separate.
Our multimodal project combines data from all of these sources, as well as the clinical follow-up data from patients, and uses machine learning methods to look at all of them together.
We hope to identify new features of cancer that drive prognosis or response to specific treatments. This research project may lead to more sensitive diagnostic approaches that could be used in clinic.





















What is long-read sequencing?


To treat cancers, we have to better understand them  and their DNA. Previously, DNA would be chopped into thousands of shorter sections. Each shorter section, or read, would be sequenced, and variants within those sections analysed.
Through this project, we are exploring the clinical potential of a new technique to sequence very long strands of individual DNA without the need to slice it up. This is long-read sequencing.
Long-read sequencing can reveal new information about whole regions and large structural features of the genome that were previously inaccessible to traditional sequencing. It will give insight into cancer that older technologies couldn't see that may reveal more accurate diagnoses and treatment for patients.

COVID-19 Study





















COVID-19 Study





COVID-19 Study


We know that a variety of factors play a part in how sick people become with COVID-19. But scientific research has shown that even when all these factors are taken into account, there is something else.

























Project overview


Helping to solve the COVID puzzle


Genomics England worked in partnership with the GenOMICC consortium, led by the University of Edinburgh, to analyse the whole genome sequences of approximately 20,000 people who have been severely affected by COVID-19. 
These cases, which were severe enough to require admission to intensive care, were then compared to 15,000 other genomes from people who were only mildly affected or had no symptoms at all.
Read on to find out more about this study.





























Aims of the study











Decode the puzzle


Discover if there are genetic reasons why COVID-19 affects people of different, age, gender and ethnicity











Find genetic causes


Understand why some healthy people become seriously ill with COVID-19











Better patient care


Uncover answers to help improve treatments for everyone















Why study how COVID-19 affects people?


Some people become very severely ill with COVID-19 and end up in hospital, while others only experienced a mild illness.
We know that a variety of factors play a part in how sick people become; an existing medical condition, being overweight, their ethnicity, and deprivation. But scientific research has shown that even when all these factors are taken into account, .
This study aimed to discover those differences.




















FAQs about the GenOMICC COVID-19 study






General questions









General questions about the study



1. Which organisations were involved in developing this study?







A wide range of expert organisations were involved in developing this project:
The  (Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care) consortium of ITUs, led by Dr Kenneth Baillie, Consultant in Critical Care Medicine, University of EdinburghGenomics England, with Sir Mark Caulfield as the scientific lead and Parker Moss as the Partnerships leadRelevant leadership from ,  (PHE),  (HDR UK) and Academic leads from the universities of Oxford, Kings College London, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Cardiff, Glasgow as well as the Wellcome Sanger Centre in CambridgeIllumina Laboratory Services (ILS) in Cambridge





2. Why did you need so many genomes?







The human genome code is 3 billion letters long. 99.9% of it is the same, one human to another. The other 0.1% is the bit that makes each of us unique. Some of the differences between us are healthy ones while others are not, but we cant say for sure which are harmful changes until we can compare thousands of genomes. Another issue is that a difference which might be healthy in one population  say of Indian heritage  could be harmful in another population. This is why having samples from as many ethnicities as possible is so important.





3. How did you ensure that the mild group of patients is representative of those affected by COVID-19?







Together with the University of Edinburgh and the GenOMICC consortium, we matched the demographics of the patients recruited for mild comparison group with those brought in to the severe group through intensive care units.
Initial studies, such as the  by Public Health England, have shown that ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by the coronavirus, so having more volunteers from ethnic minority backgrounds was incredibly important.
, in which our former Chief Scientist Professor Sir Mark Caulfield was involved, suggested that many of the expected factors (such as socio-economic) are not enough to explain the disparities. This means must look at genomic differences for more answers, and we tried to match those severely affected with those who were only mildly affected.








Results









Results



1. What results were you expecting?







We expected to see some signals around genes involved in blood group determination (this has already been established). We then looked very carefully at immune system genes as this would be an obvious place for differences to be important. We also looked carefully at genes with instructions for the particular kind of cell docking bays that allow the virus to break into our cells.
Beyond that, we kept an open mind, and results are still forthcoming.





2. When can we expect to see results from this study?







The first genomes from our severe volunteers came through in June 2020. By June 2021, interim findings from the study were published. With luck and the very hard work of our scientists, these findings have already helped doctors make better decisions when treating patients with COVID-19, resulting in better outcomes. 
In addition, two therapeutic drug trials have also commenced.
The final findings from the study are anticipated to be published in early 2022.Please note that our volunteers for both the severe and mild groups will not receive any individual, personalised results as this is not a clinical programme. However, what we discover through your help will be of value in the next wave of the pandemic. If you signed up for the study, you were given the option to consent to being told more about the outcomes from the research, later down the line.








Data security and access









Data security and access



1. What happens to patients data after it has been sequenced? Where will their data be stored?







Once our sequencing partner Illumina sequenced patients whole genomes, they sent this data to Genomics England. We then stripped identifiable, personal data from this, and the de-identified genomic data is stored in our secure database, the National Genomic Research Library. Only validated researchers with express permission are allowed to access the raw data.
This data is protected to the same high standards as the data collected from the 100,000 Genomes Project.





2. How did you ensure that data is protected, and remains anonymous and confidential?







Consent to use genomic data was obtained from patients or their families, utilising the GenOMICC studys existing network of research nurses and clinicians across the country.
Genomics Englands priority has always been to ensure that the data of all participants is protected. Any data that researchers can access has been de-identified. This data cannot be removed or copied by researchers. We are committed to full transparency about the use of peoples data. Read our full  for more information.





3. How is volunteers data protected?







All participant data is stripped of any identifiable, personal details and the de-identified genomic data is stored in our secure cloud database. 
Most of us use cloud services for things like storing photos and music on our mobile phones. Cloud services are actually high security warehouses filled with massive computing computer. Genome data is enormous, and we use a cloud service from Amazon Web Services (AWS)  based in the UK  to provide a secure cloud computing and storage infrastructure. We use another tech company called Lifebit to help researchers wrangle this huge quantity of data, using their unique technology platform. 
We joined forces with AWS and Lifebit to ensure that all the data we look after is highly secure, while allowing researchers to do their analysis flexibly.
Any data that researchers can access has been de-identified.

100,000 Genomes Project participants









100,000 Genomes Project participants



1. How are 100,000 Genomes Project participants involved in this study? How will their data be used?







Participants of the 100,000 Genomes Project were a key part of the jigsaw in the COVID-19 study. Many 100,000 Genomes Project participants who had severe COVID consented to be included in the study, and many who tested positive but had mild symptoms volunteered as well.
Peoples genomes contain many changes which are normal and not associated with ill health. Because we have the health records and genomes of the people that took part in the 100,000 Genomes Project, we can use their data to help check whether changes we see in COVID-19 patients genomes are just healthy changes, or likely to be associated with a harmful response. Their data was of huge value in this programme.
We are very grateful to the participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project who have agreed to have their data used in this way.





2. What about 100,000 Genomes Project participants who have yet to receive results for either main findings or additional findings?







Although many participants will have received a result at this stage, we are aware that there are still some participants who have not received anything yet. We have also promised to do reanalysis for all 100,000 Genomes Project participants, and  for those who have asked for them. Unfortunately, this work was delayed due to our focus on COVID-19. Genomics England and NHS England have jointly written  explaining the current situation and next steps.

What makes human genomes diverse?









What makes human genomes diverse?


Human genomes are 99.9% identical; however, it's differences in the 0.1% which make each of us unique  whether in terms of our hair colour, our like/dislike of certain foods, and even our sleeping patterns.
Variations in genomes can results from factors such as human migration patterns, our ancestry and choice of mate, and oftentimes environmental factors (which along with genetics, can contribute to a trait such as height and weight).
These variants tend to appear at different frequencies across different populations. Sometimes, they're rare and impact only specific families. At other times, the variants are common and can be found across populations.






Why do we need more diverse data?









Why do we need more diverse data?


The human genome is complicated and the discoveries through research have only scratched the surface of understanding everything there is to know about what makes humans unique at the molecular level.
The overrepresentation of populations from WEIRD societies (western, educated, industrialised, rich, and democratic), but particularly of white European descent in genomic databases, has resulted in misdiagnoses, poor understanding of conditions and inconsistent delivery of care, as well as mistrust amongst excluded communities on the collection and use of their genetic data. As a result, genomic medicine does not always benefit all people equally.
Prioritising diversity in genomic research can lead to a range of benefits including new understanding of genes that underlie diseases, new treatments for a more diverse range of people populations, more accurate reading of a persons risk of developing a specific disease, and the design of a clinical management strategy tailored to individuals.






Why has enhancing diversity in genomics research been a difficult task?









Why has enhancing diversity in genomics research been a difficult task?


Underrepresentation in genomics research can be attributed to many complex barriers such as language, economic circumstances, cultural beliefs, as well as other pertinent social and psychological factors.
In addition, historical injustice and lived experiences have led underrepresented communities to build a wall of mistrust against medical research. Mistrust has stemmed from very real historical events and abuses, and is reinforced through the current sociopolitical climate. In addition, both inaccessible and insufficient communications have complicated the understanding of benefits and use of their personal data to participants.

Prioritising diversity in genomic research can lead to a range of benefits including new understanding of genes that underlie diseases, new treatments for a more diverse range of people populations, more accurate reading of a persons risk of developing a specific disease, and the design of a clinical management strategy tailored to individuals.




Why has enhancing diversity in genomics research been a difficult task?


Underrepresentation in genomics research can be attributed to many complex barriers such as language, economic circumstances, cultural beliefs, as well as other pertinent social and psychological factors.
In addition, historical injustice and lived experiences have led underrepresented communities to build a wall of mistrust against medical research. Mistrust has stemmed from very real historical events and abuses, and is reinforced through the current sociopolitical climate. In addition, both inaccessible and insufficient communications have complicated the understanding of benefits and use of their personal data to participants.














People of European genetic ancestry represent ~80%


of people in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)




Some polygenic risk scores are ~4x


more accurate for people of European genetic ancestry than of African genetic ancestry




7% of significant associations


have been discovered in individuals of African ancestry




while only 2%


of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) participants are of African genetic ancestry










Through the initiative we hope to:












Earn the trust of diverse communities in personalised medicine












Expand and improve genomics research with diverse populations












Improve prognosis, diagnosis, treatment, and care involving genomics for diverse populations

Newborn Genomes Programme





















Newborn Genomes Programme





Newborn Genomes Programme


Delivering the NHS-embedded Generation Study



















































The Generation Study


Every year hundreds of babies are born in the UK with rare genetic conditions. Early intervention can enhance the health and quality of life of many of these babies. But these conditions can be hard to diagnose, leading to delays in care. 
The Generation Study is a groundbreaking research study which will sequence the genomes of 100,000 newborn babies. We are running our study in partnership with the NHS to understand whether we can improve our ability to diagnose and treat genetic conditions. 
Our study has been developed following extensive consultation with the public, parents and families affected by rare conditions as well as healthcare professionals, policy makers and scientists. It will involve babies born in a number of different hospitals in England and will run until March 2025. The results will add to evidence that will inform future decisions on using whole genome sequencing to support newborn screening. This includes using it to accelerate diagnosis and access to treatments for rare conditions. 
There is more information available on our  for parents who are invited to participate in our study.
 



























Aims of the Generation Study








1. Identify rare conditions in babies earlier







The Generation Study will evaluate the utility and feasibility of using genome sequencing to screen newborn babies for a larger number of rare conditions that can then be treated in the NHS. This aims to improve their health outcomes and quality of life through more timely diagnoses, access to care and treatment.





2. Enable research







With parents consent, babies genomes and health data will be accessed for wider research about genes and health, so we can investigate new testing and treatment for genetic conditions in the future. Approved researchers can access this data in a secure database called  without knowing babies identities.





3. Explore the risks and benefits of storing an individuals genome over their lifetime







Well continue engaging with the public, parents, healthcare professionals, rare disease communities and policymakers to look at the possible benefits, risks, ethical and practical implications of storing an individuals genome over their lifetime.













The rare conditions that the Generation Study will screen for


















We are using whole genome sequencing to look for changes in genes linked to more than 200 rare conditions. The conditions we test for:
Usually appear in the first few years of lifeCan be improved if caught earlyCan be treated through the NHS in England
These conditions have different types of symptoms, but can all cause someone to be more sick than the average child. 
To find out more about the conditions we are screening for you can have a look at  and .
 









How was our study designed


We have worked with parents, the public, rare condition communities, and key stakeholders in the NHS, academia and Government to explore the practical, ethical and societal questions our study raises and how best to deliver it. From , we have used a range of approaches including user research to co-design our study, develop materials collaboratively, and discuss with different communities. This work was essential to receiving Health Research Authority approval to run our study and favourable opinion from the Research Ethics Committee.
We are committed to promoting  to the Generation Study. Expectant parents from a diversity of backgrounds, socio-economic, geographic and language groups will be invited to participate. 
Our  is available on our website.

Why our study is separate from standard NHS care


Our study is for research, so it is optional and separate from standard NHS care. Every baby in the UK is currently offered the  (the heel prick test). This looks for 9 rare, serious and treatable health conditions. It is standard NHS care and is recommended. 
 









How is our study addressing ethical questions


The Generation Study raises a complex set of . Some of these are emerging in newborn genomic screening studies globally and some are unique to the UK context. We are embedding an ethically robust approach through tackling these challenges head-on, orientating our study within a strong ethical framework and promoting flexibility in responding to ethical issues. Our discussions on ethical issues like the consent process, withdrawal and recruitment have been assisted by the Newborns Ethics Working Group, and our wider stakeholders. 




























How we look after the data and samples


We and samples from all participants in the study. 
Participants genome and health data are stored in a data base called the National Genomic Research Library. It can only be accessed by approved researchers who wont be able to see the identities of participants. Researchers could come from hospitals, universities, charities or healthcare companies. They can use the data to learn more about genes and health, find new conditions, and develop new treatments.




























How we have built on our existing knowledge and expertise


Through working in partnership with NHS England to deliver the  and the , we at Genomics England have established infrastructure to support the use of whole genome sequencing, and the diagnostic and treatment pathways for children and adults with symptoms, and have developed the sequencing and analytical tools to ensure a safe and effective service.
We have a strong record of keeping data safe in other studies and manage who has access to the data in the National Genomic Research Library, which includes data from thousands of individuals with consent.










Information on how parents are invited to take part


















A network of selected NHS Trusts in England are expected to take part in our study. Only parents with babies born in the participating hospitals will be able to take part. Not all the of the hospitals will be starting at once. 
We'll update our website with these hospital trusts as our study launches. 
For parents who are invited to participate in our study, there is more information available on our .

100,000 Genomes Project





















100,000 Genomes Project





100,000 Genomes Project


Genomics England's very first initiative  sequencing 100,000 genomes from around 85,000 NHS patients affected by rare disease or cancer  is leading to groundbreaking insights and continued findings into the role genomics can play in healthcare.
















































The impact of the project


The 100,000 Genomes Project was a British initiative to sequence and study the role our genes play in health and disease. Recruitment was completed in December 2018, although research and analysis is still ongoing. 
Our participants have already helped us find actionable results for many patients with rare diseases and cancer.





Key facts











18.5%


of data from the Project turned into actionable findings













85K+


participants' genomes sequenced for the Project













100K+


genomes sequenced by December 2018














Aims of the 100,000 Genomes Project











Make genomics part of routine healthcare


by working closely with the NHS to integrate whole genome sequencing











Enhance genomic healthcare research


by creating the largest genomic healthcare data resource in the world











Uncover answers for participants


both now and in the future through genomic-level analysis of conditions















A world-first study


Demonstrating impact


A world-first study using data on the 100,000 Genomes Project, and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, has demonstrated for the first time that whole genome sequencing (WGS) can uncover new diagnoses for people across the broadest range of rare diseases investigated to date and could deliver enormous benefits across the NHS.The study looked at over four thousand people from over two thousand families who were early participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project. It found that using WGS led to a new diagnosis for 25% of the participants. Of these new diagnoses, 14% found variations in regions of the genome that would be missed by other methods, including other types of non-whole genomic tests.





























Additional findings analysis


Our additional findings analysis focuses on looking for gene alterations in a specific list of genes that may increase the risk of people developing certain health conditions. In the case of increased chance of disease, steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of the associated health condition developing or the condition can be treated and monitored.


















Check Your Choice portal


Participants have the opportunity to check whether they have consented to receiving additional findings results, and to let us know if they've changed their minds.














Future of the project









Future of the project


Results from the 100,000 Genomes Project are still being returned to participants.
Beyond direct results, an additional and critically important spin off is the importance of this huge amount of data to researchers. Researchers are still using the data from the Project (and will continue to do so for many years to come) to develop new treatments, diagnostics, devices and medicines. 
Only data that participants have consented to share is available to these approved researchers for further study.







Delivering the project









Delivering the project


In 2018, after just 5 years, we sequenced the 100,000th genome and met our goal.
The 100,000 Genomes Project has used the generosity of patients and the outstanding skills and talent found in the medical and the life sciences sectors in the UK to help deliver this project. Genomic Englands legacy is a genomics service that has been adopted by the NHS, high ethical standards and public support for genomics, new medicines, treatments and diagnostics and a country which hosts the worlds leading genomic companies.






Background









Background


In late 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron announced the 100,000 Genomes Project.
Genomics England, a company wholly owned and funded by the Department of Health & Social Care, was set up to deliver this flagship project and sequence 100,000 whole genomes from NHS patients, something that at the time no one in the world had even attempted.
The project represented a great opportunity to translate our world class genomic science into world leadership in genomic medicine.

Patients and Participants


None of our work would be possible without the consent and support of patients and participants  they are at the heart of everything that we do. By enabling scientists and clinicians in their research, a patients data goes from being an isolated dot to a key part of the picture. 
























The collective power behind improving genomic medicine


Participants in genomic medicine and research come from a variety of backgrounds, but share a common interest in wanting the benefits of genomic medicine to be available quickly and widely  for themselves, their families, their communities and society as a whole.
In return, we make sure that participants have a say in how their data is shared and in shaping the programmes that use it, because it leads to better decisions about how genomics can have an impact on our healthcare and our lives.




Where would you like to go?













Make a lasting impact


Participants who donate their genome sequence and health data can potentially get answers for their own diagnoses, plus provide answers for others with similar conditions, now or in the future. 
Arthur joined for that reason  to find answers for not only him but perhaps his future children, grandchildren, or others who also have been diagnosed with albinism. Watch his story in this short video.




















Data in our initiatives


Maintaining your data security and protecting your privacy underpins everything we do. 
All patient data is held in secure facilities based in the UK, accessible only by approved researchers in our secure, cloud-based Research Environment.

Taking part





















Taking part





Transform the future of healthcare


Genomic medicine is already helping more people receive answers about their health conditions through better diagnosis, treatment, and support. By volunteering to take part in research, you'll be making a difference to NHS patients and the future of genomic medicine.










































How it works


As part of your clinical care with the , you may be offered whole genome sequencing. Your clinician may also ask you whether you would like to add your genome sequence and health data to the National Genomic Research Library (NGRL). This is helping patients across the NHS get more answers to their health questions through research.
It's your choice. If you consent, your data is de-identified and added to the NGRL  our secure, national database of genomic and health data.
Approved researchers and clinicians can then compare your de-identified samples and data with thousands of other people. The more people that take part, the more likely you are to get an accurate diagnosis.




























The consent journey






1


You and your clinician may decide together that whole genome sequencing might be helpful as part of your care







2


DNA is extracted from a blood sample you give, and then sequenced







3


Your genome (DNA) data is stored and analysed







4


Your clinical team will get the results and discuss them with you







5


If you consent to further research, your information will be de-identified and aggregated with thousands of other participants' data







6


Researchers will study the data to gain biological insights, and develop diagnostics and treatments to improve NHS patients' lives











It's your choice


Its up to you whether or not you want to contribute your data to the National Genomic Research Library. If you say no, you will still get your genomic test and it will not change or affect the care you receive from the NHS.









Possible benefits of consenting to include your data in the National Genomic Research Library












Get answers


For you or others now or in the future that could lead to a diagnosis, access to a different treatment, or an opportunity to participate in clinical trials












Help others with similar conditions


Insights from your data may be able to provide answers for people with a similar condition and even those with many other sorts of conditions












Be part of transforming healthcare


By participating, you'll be part of a new national approach working with the NHS to bring together health data and genomic data for better patient care












The impact of genomic research  Jessica's story


When Jessica was just 4 years old, she was diagnosed with a rare condition. After receiving her sample, and after filtering the results against our curated knowledge base, we were able to find the one causal variant out of the 6.4 million we originally found. A diagnosis made it possible to recommend a special, personalised treatment that helps reduce Jessica's symptoms.

Our work so far on engaging with communities



The legacy of language: What we say, and what people hear, when we talk about genomics. This research published in  reveals the difference between what we say and what people hear when engaging underrepresented communities around genomics and healthcare. Researchers from Wellcome Connecting Science and Genomics England leveraged framing theory and behavioural science to develop alternate ways to connect with traditionally disengaged audiences and conducted focus groups with 100 people from British communities of varying backgrounds.

The Newborn Genomes Programme Consent Dialogue: Ethnic Minority Community Leaders. was conducted to better understand how to design and communicate the Newborn Genomes Programme in a way that is fair and inclusive, removing barriers to participation for expectant parents from five ethnic minority communities. 

Ambassadors and their projects: 

 was led by Aman Ali and surveyed 1,007 Muslims living in the UK to understand whether pre-conceptions about muslim's attitudes towards health research and genomics more broadly are based in fact. The aim of this report is for the findings to help explore how to better engage with Muslims to increase Muslim representation in genetic research. 

', led by Primrose Granville, was filmed in Jamaica. This series was filmed to understand the differences in sentiment between the Black Caribbean and Black African diaspora in the UK versus majority Black communities around the world, and feed these insights into our Diverse Data programme. 

 was created by Dr Amalina Bakri to explain how genetics screening can help patients' diagnosis and treatment.

Research Domains






Research Network communities(8)












Bioinformatics and Machine Learning community









Research in this community will focus on the development, refinement, validation and application of bioinformatics approaches to interrogate data in the NGRL and maximise the ability for clinically relevant discovery. It will facilitate the open exchange and sharing of computational ideas and methods, including powerful machine learning approaches. It will also ensure best practices in clinical interpretation analysis, work with disease groups to provide access to world-leading statistical and computational data analysis expertise; and provide training and support a world-leading workforce in support of genomic-based healthcare.


Domain leads





Professor Chris Yau


University of Oxford






Dr David Morris


King's College London













Genotype-Phenotype Association community









The research of this community will seek to identify novel variant-trait associations and identify where such genotypic information can be leveraged for clinical application; such as the provision of polygenic risk scores and development of screening and treatment strategies. Particular attention will be given to the analysis of ancestries underrepresented in genomic research. This community will implement and improve tools for such analyses.


Domain leads





Professor Diana Baralle


University of Southampton






Dr Gavin Arno


UCL













Implementation and Data Enhancement community









Research in this community will explore the social, economic, legal, and ethical effectiveness of Genomic Medicine in the NHS, as well as work to improve data quality and availability.


Domain lead





Professor AJ McKnight


Queens University Belfast













Pan-Cancer and Molecular Oncology community









The Pan-Cancer and Molecular Oncology community will carry out research across all tumour and germline samples present in the NGRL. It will use the data to identify and investigate driver mutations across tumours, to find functional alterations and impaired biological mechanisms common to all/many cancers, and to establish whether there are common mutational signatures that affect treatment efficacy and toxicity


Domain leads





Professor Richard Houlston


Institute of Cancer Research






Professor Anna Schuh


University of Oxford













Population Genomics community









This research aims to improve our understanding of human genetic variation and the processes that shape it, such as demography, ancestry, natural selection and genetic mutation. It also aims to elucidate the genomic contribution to disease and health in the population, and to inform diagnosis, treatment and the potential impact of interventions. 


Domain leads





Dr Aylwyn Scally


University of Cambridge






Professor Jean-Baptiste Cazier


Francis Crick Institute













Predisposition and Screening community









The Predisposition and Screening community will analyse genome data from families and individuals in the NGRL, including participants in the Generation Study and Diverse Data initiative, to identify de novo and inherited variants causing or predisposing to disease in diverse ancestries.


Domain leads





Professor Elijah Behr


St George's University






Professor Sanjay Sisodiya


UCL













Therapeutic Innovation and Trials community









This community will support research that propels genomic and clinical insight and discovery into therapeutic development and application.


Domain leads





Professor Danny Gale


UCL






Dr Haiyan Zhou


UCL













Variant Discovery and Clinical Interpretation community









Research in this community will strive to provide molecular diagnoses for participants by identifying or validating variants that explain previously undiagnosed cases and feeding these discoveries back into clinical practice via the appropriate pathways. New tools and data will be leveraged to tackle challenges and improve of ability to rapidly and reliably identify disease variants.

The life-changing impact of genomics


Through the 100,000 Genomes Project, thousands of people living with rare conditions and cancer have received diagnoses. Many of these would not have been previously detectable.
While our aim is to get diagnoses for everyone, we also recognise that many others are still waiting for answers.






One of the first children to be diagnosed, whole genome sequencing narrowed down the possible causes of Jessicas rare condition from 6.4 million variants to one. 






Bhavini shares how having a genetic diagnosis answered so many questions for her, and has empowered her to help raise awareness and break down cultural taboos.






Tom has lived with an ultra-rare skin disorder called pachyonychia congenita his entire life.














Having lived with a rare form of sarcoma cancer for 20 years, Rachel had whole genome sequencing in 2017 to get more answers.






Owen has an ultra-rare thyroid condition, only detected in 30 people worldwide.






Sol doesn't have a genetic diagnosis for his sight loss condition yet, but he shares how he hopes his health data can help aid in future genomic research.











Special anniversary podcasts

How your data is used





















How your data is used





How your data is used


None of our work would be possible without the consent and support of patients and participants  they are at the heart of everything that we do. By enabling scientists and clinicians in their research, a patients data goes from being an isolated dot to a key part of the picture.
























Your data in the National Genomic Research Library


The data we collect is stored in the National Genomic Research Library, a platform built by us and NHS England that allows approved researchers to access samples, genomic data, and other associated health data via a secure .
Researchers who use the Research Environment can learn more about everyones health by looking for patterns in the de-identified data of thousands of participants.
Being able to compare all patient data in one place provides researchers with an opportunity to better understand diseases, develop new treatments and can lead to new diagnoses.
All data in the National Genomic Research Library has been de-identified and cannot be extracted by researchers.



























What kind of data is stored in the National Genomic Research Library?


Types of de-identified data that are collected:



Your medical test results

Electronic copies of your health records from the NHS, your GP and other organisations (such as NHS Digital and Public Health England)

Information about any illnesses or stays in hospital  including your primary diagnosis and any historic diagnoses going back as far as medical records allow

Copies of hospital or clinic records, medical notes, social care, and local or national disease registries

Relevant imaging data from your NHS records, such as MRI scans, X-rays or pathology images









A lifetime resource


Your records will continue to be updated throughout your lifetime, for as long as you give us permission to. This lifelong health data may allow development of better treatments or diagnostics for others.









Why do we gather clinical data as well as your genome sequence?


To take a deeper approach to genomic research, we need as much detail as possible about a participants medical condition and symptoms.
Even small differences in symptoms between individuals might be crucial in understanding what changes in a genome mean, and helping decide the best treatments.
Only by understanding your detailed clinical data are we able to understand how patterns in your genome affect your diagnosis.



























What will the data be used for?












Finding treatments


Helping to find new treatments and possibly cures for a wide range of health conditions.












Improving analysis


Researchers might use the data to try and find new, faster ways to analyse large amounts of data.












Sharing knowledge


Researchers may share their findings with other scientists and doctors through publications or meetings to help research advance as quickly as possible.












Developing drug and diagnostic tests


New drugs and diagnostic tests may be developed by the NHS, universities and companies across the world.












Suggesting clinical trials or relevant research


Researchers will be able to find opportunities for you, and others like you, to take part in relevant research projects or clinical trials.












Keeping your data safe


De-identifying data in the National Genomic Research Library


Maintaining your data security and protecting your privacy is our top priority


To maintain your privacy, information that could identify you  like name, date of birth, and all other personal details  is removed from your health records and genomic data.
This process of de-identifying data ensures that researchers have no way of identifying individual participants while using the Research Environment.




















Keeping your data safe

How is data stored and secured?


Genome data is enormous, and we use a cloud service from Amazon Web Services (AWS)  based in the UK  to provide a secure cloud computing and storage infrastructure. All patient data is held in secure facilities based in the UK.
All of the data from the National Genomic Research Library stays within the secure, monitored Research Environment where it can be analysed by researchers.
In this way, Genomics England considers the National Genomic Research Library to be a reading library  not a lending library.





How we protect your data:








Continuously review latest best practice for secure storage







Use industry-standard tools and techniques to prevent unauthorised access







Regularly undertake security tests







Meet all laws and standards for data protection







Closely monitor all activity on the secure Research Environment











Who has access to the data?


Anyone with access to the de-identified data in the National Genomic Research Library must be approved by the  and Genomics England.






Researchers















Approved researchers may work for not-for-profit organisations, such as universities, hospitals, or research charities, and for-profit (commercial) companies such as pharma, biotech or diagnostic companies from around the world who will work with de-identified data to better understand diseases and develop diagnostics and treatments.





Clinicians and healthcare staff















Doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals in the NHS have access to information about the patients they are caring for.
This is to enable clinical staff to see any results or findings from whole genome sequencing for patients in their care.





Service providers















Approved organisations who provide the data itself, IT support, computing infrastructure, data storage, genome analysis, or other technical services. 
Each company only has access to the part of the data centre they are working on or supporting, and all individuals have undergone Information Governance training and signed confidentiality agreements.








Keeping your data safe

Approval process for all researchers


Also known as our 'airlock' system






1


Researchers submit an application requesting access to our secure research environment.







2


Applications are reviewed by an independent Access Review Committee, overseen by us and NHS England.







3


Researchers have their identities checked and confirmed.







4


The researchers organisation is required to sign legal documentation.







5


Only when approved are researchers given secure access to the National Genomic Research Library.







6


All research activity is continually monitored by Genomics England.











The data will never be used for insurance or marketing purposes, nor for speculative searches, such as checks of DNA profiles or other information derived from your sample.
The Department of Health and Social Care has had confirmation from the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers that they will not seek access to Genomics Englands data without presentation of a court order.
For further details of unacceptable uses, please see the list as detailed in the Research Ethics Committee approved Protocol.









FAQs






Data sources









Data sources



1. Where do you gather health data from?







We get data from many places. The main ones are:

 These come from all NHS trusts in England, including acute hospitals, primary care trusts and mental health trusts. This data is collected during a patients time at hospital. It includes details of diagnosis, treatment received and other details about the patient. HES information is stored as a large collection of separate records  one for each period of care.Patient Report Outcome Measure Data (PROMs): This data measures health gain typically in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement but is also used to measure a patients health or health-related quality of life at a single point in time. This dataset lets us see whether there is any relationship between a gene variant and how well patients do after treatment or surgery.Mental Health and Learning Disability Set (MHLDS): This is used to analyse patient pathways and enable a deep understanding of mental health service users interactions with acute secondary care. For the project it is a particularly important data set as many participants with rare conditions have learning disabilities. But it also helps us see whether mental health problems such as depression are an unrecognised symptom of a genetic variant.: a central collection of detailed information held by NHS Digital about diagnostic imaging tests carried out on patients, such as XRays and MRI scans. This data can provide insights into whether particular gene variants are associated with a particular tumour or condition.: Cause of death is a crucial piece of information. If a patient dies of a different illness, or in an accident, we need to record this as otherwise it will skew the data. And if people die earlier, or live longer than expected it will help us pick out the variants associated with this. Having mortality data will also reveal if people with one condition die disproportionately from another, such as heart attacks. Approval to link to this data with Office of National Statistic Data (which records deaths) must be granted by both NHS Digital and the ONS.
Participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project cancer programme give their explicit consent to allow their patient records to be linked to the data collected by the National Cancer Registration Service in Public Health England. More information on the data collected by the National Cancer Registration Service and how it is used is available at .





2. Are you gathering data from new sources?







Genomics England is constantly working to identify new sources of health data to include which is important for research.
Where possible and appropriate, Genomics England will look to obtain and make available data from other research studies so that your data can be compared against more people.








Data for research










1. What type of research and for what purposes will users want to access the data?







Genomics England has established the . Researchers who are approved to become a member of GECIP will work in domains dependent on their expertise, for example cardiology, breast cancer, neurology, paediatrics or analytics. Because very little is still known about the human genome, bringing together researchers to examine and interpret the data will mean that our knowledge about disease and how it could be treated will be vastly improved.





2. How will users access the data for research purposes?







Research users will have restricted, remote access to de-identified datasets which contain only the information they need for their specific and approved research study.





3. Will research users be able to take data away?







Research users will be able to download the anonymised results of their analysis, provided that these results do not reveal the identity of any of the participants. The Information Commissioners Office has a , and this gives an indication of what will, and will not be, allowed.
The data systems that Genomics England have in place will not allow users to cut and paste data into their own systems. Clinicians will be able to download the clinical reports on participants in their care.








Data for clinicians










1. How do clinicians receive information on their patients?







Clinicians will receive feedback on participants in their care in a downloadable clinical report.





2. Will the clinical report change as our understanding and knowledge of disease improves over time?







Yes. Genomics England expects that as new research reveals new information of relevance to a participants medical condition, then a new clinical report which captures this additional information will be issued to their clinician.
The National Genomic Research Library brings together lots of data from different sources, so Genomics England will always make your data available to the NHS if they need it for your clinical care.





3. What information will the clinical report contain?







Clinical reports are different for rare disease patients and for cancer patients.
For rare disease patients and their family members who are also taking part, their reports will be divided into three tiers of results.
The first tier includes findings that, with current knowledge and in line with NHS standard practice, could be fed back to the participant after being validated and signed off by their NHS Genomic Medicine Centre. These findings are limited to variants in sets of genes that when disrupted are known to cause the clinical condition under consideration. These are called virtual gene panels and are specific to the disease being investigated.
Tier two provides a larger list of variants in that same gene panel that can be helpful in gaining a more complete picture of the genetic basis of the participants clinical condition under consideration.
Tier three is more explorative and is not limited to virtual gene panels but looks at the whole genome, all of the participants health data and their family history. In some instances, information generated from this tier will highlight findings that were missed when the first two tiers were looked at and could lead to a new or more precise diagnosis for the participant. This section of the report will also include results on additional findings if participants have consented to those being looked for. This tier is where new research advances are likely to be made.
Reports for cancer patients will mainly be in three sections with information gleaned from the whole genome sequencing data:
a high level description of the tumours genome and the most obvious ways it differs from the patients normal genomegenetic changes in the tumour which are not present in the patients normal DNA in genes known to be involved in causing cancerchanges in the normal DNA, in known cancer genes, that can make patients susceptible to the cancer that is being investigated.As the Project evolves and in consultation with stakeholders, Genomics England will provide additional information that may help in the prognosis or management of the patients condition.








Data access










1. How will hackers be prevented from gaining access?







Genomics England is using industry-standard tools and techniques to prevent unauthorised access. Patient data travels from the NHS Genomic Medicine Centres to the Genomics England data centre  over the dedicated NHS N3 network.
Like any organisation, we are subject to attempts to probe our systems from outside and we regularly test to ensure that none succeed. We have no evidence of being targeted specifically.





2. What literature will users have to sign before accessing the data?







All research users must sign an electronic data access agreement and submit this to Genomics Englands independent Access Review Committee along with their research application for approval. Only when their research study has been approved will they be granted remote access to only those de-identified datasets they need for their specific and approved research study.
Clinicians will not have to sign a data access agreement as by the very nature of their profession they will already have to abide by certain professional standards and adhere to their Trusts data governance policies when dealing with a patients data. Failure to do so would be in breach of their terms of employment resulting in appropriate action being taken.





3. Is there a charge for access?







NHS clinicians will have access to data on patients in their care free of charge.
Academic researchers participating in Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership will also have access to de-identified data free of charge, subject to their research study being approved.
Genomics England is charging industry to participate in the  because providing storage, security and analytic services for the data is costly and it is only right that for profit companies accessing the data for research purposes should contribute to these costs.





4. Will my personal data be passed to other government agencies or the police? If so, what are the protections that are in place?







No data held by Genomics England will be accessible to other government agencies which includes HMRC and the Child Support Agency. In the unusual situation that a request for data is made by a court order then this will be referred to Genomics Englands Legal Counsel as promptly as possible so that all representations may be made to the court, for example, to limit the information requested being released.
The Department of Health has had confirmation from the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers that they will not seek access to Genomics England s data.





5. Will having my genome sequenced affect my life insurance?







Most of the time taking part in research projects wont affect insurance premiums. You dont normally have to tell insurers that you are taking part in research, or about genetic test results. However, when applying for insurance you do have to disclose any symptoms you experience or any diagnoses, screening, or treatments you receive, if this information is requested on the application form.








Data security










1. Is identifiable data held separately and more securely?







Direct identifiers, such as name and date of birth, will be held in a separate part of the data infrastructure. This part of the data infrastructure will be more secure, in the sense that it will not be accessible to researchers; nor, indeed, will it be accessible to the majority of Genomics England staff. Given the sensitive nature of the health and genome data, similar expectations of security apply across the whole of the data infrastructure.
In the rare cases where Genomics England staff need access to identifiable data, access will only be granted following explicit approval from Genomics Englands Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO). Access to identifiable data will be strictly limited and protected. All actions can be audited and monitored.





2. What sanctions and penalties are in place for misappropriate use of the data?







Maintaining data security and protecting the privacy of participants is of the upmost importance to Genomics England.
Any researcher who attempts to re-identify data (and thus identify a participant) runs a significant risk of detection. Genomics England has penalties in place for any organisation or individual who breaches or attempts to breach a participants identity confidentiality. 
Penalties for misappropriate use include revocation of user access, withdrawal of access for the organisation the offending user is employed or contracted to, and the reporting of the offending activity to the Information Commissioner which could result in a fine of up to 500,000 or even imprisonment under section 55 of the Data Protection Act.





3. What is the difference between anonymised and pseudonymised data?







The Information Commissioner (ICO) defines anonymisation as the process of turning data into a form which does not identify individuals and where identification is not likely to take place. The ICO also has a . There is no standard definition for pseudonymised, and the two words are often used to mean the same thing. There is one, key, technical difference, in that anonymised can be used to refer to aggregate data, or results, whereas pseudonymised can only refer to individual-level data, but this does not mean that pseudonymised data is easier to identify  it depends upon the data, and the context.
For Genomics England, only anonymised data can be exported from the secure environment: this may be aggregate, results data, or other data from which so much information has been removed that it is highly unlikely that it could be re-associated with individual participants.
Within the secure data system, the data available to researchers is de-identified in the sense that personal identifiers have been removed, together with any other information that is not needed for their specific, approved research purposes. More than this, a fresh, unique reference may be generated for each research purpose, so that researchers are not able to collect information about individuals across research studies.

Clinicians will receive feedback on participants in their care in a downloadable clinical report.





2. Will the clinical report change as our understanding and knowledge of disease improves over time?







Yes. Genomics England expects that as new research reveals new information of relevance to a participants medical condition, then a new clinical report which captures this additional information will be issued to their clinician.
The National Genomic Research Library brings together lots of data from different sources, so Genomics England will always make your data available to the NHS if they need it for your clinical care.





3. What information will the clinical report contain?







Clinical reports are different for rare disease patients and for cancer patients.
For rare disease patients and their family members who are also taking part, their reports will be divided into three tiers of results.
The first tier includes findings that, with current knowledge and in line with NHS standard practice, could be fed back to the participant after being validated and signed off by their NHS Genomic Medicine Centre. These findings are limited to variants in sets of genes that when disrupted are known to cause the clinical condition under consideration. These are called virtual gene panels and are specific to the disease being investigated.
Tier two provides a larger list of variants in that same gene panel that can be helpful in gaining a more complete picture of the genetic basis of the participants clinical condition under consideration.
Tier three is more explorative and is not limited to virtual gene panels but looks at the whole genome, all of the participants health data and their family history. In some instances, information generated from this tier will highlight findings that were missed when the first two tiers were looked at and could lead to a new or more precise diagnosis for the participant. This section of the report will also include results on additional findings if participants have consented to those being looked for. This tier is where new research advances are likely to be made.
Reports for cancer patients will mainly be in three sections with information gleaned from the whole genome sequencing data:
a high level description of the tumours genome and the most obvious ways it differs from the patients normal genomegenetic changes in the tumour which are not present in the patients normal DNA in genes known to be involved in causing cancerchanges in the normal DNA, in known cancer genes, that can make patients susceptible to the cancer that is being investigated.As the Project evolves and in consultation with stakeholders, Genomics England will provide additional information that may help in the prognosis or management of the patients condition.







1. How will hackers be prevented from gaining access?







Genomics England is using industry-standard tools and techniques to prevent unauthorised access. Patient data travels from the NHS Genomic Medicine Centres to the Genomics England data centre  over the dedicated NHS N3 network.
Like any organisation, we are subject to attempts to probe our systems from outside and we regularly test to ensure that none succeed. We have no evidence of being targeted specifically.





2. What literature will users have to sign before accessing the data?







All research users must sign an electronic data access agreement and submit this to Genomics Englands independent Access Review Committee along with their research application for approval. Only when their research study has been approved will they be granted remote access to only those de-identified datasets they need for their specific and approved research study.
Clinicians will not have to sign a data access agreement as by the very nature of their profession they will already have to abide by certain professional standards and adhere to their Trusts data governance policies when dealing with a patients data. Failure to do so would be in breach of their terms of employment resulting in appropriate action being taken.





3. Is there a charge for access?







NHS clinicians will have access to data on patients in their care free of charge.
Academic researchers participating in Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership will also have access to de-identified data free of charge, subject to their research study being approved.
Genomics England is charging industry to participate in the  because providing storage, security and analytic services for the data is costly and it is only right that for profit companies accessing the data for research purposes should contribute to these costs.





4. Will my personal data be passed to other government agencies or the police? If so, what are the protections that are in place?







No data held by Genomics England will be accessible to other government agencies which includes HMRC and the Child Support Agency. In the unusual situation that a request for data is made by a court order then this will be referred to Genomics Englands Legal Counsel as promptly as possible so that all representations may be made to the court, for example, to limit the information requested being released.
The Department of Health has had confirmation from the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers that they will not seek access to Genomics England s data.





5. Will having my genome sequenced affect my life insurance?







Most of the time taking part in research projects wont affect insurance premiums. You dont normally have to tell insurers that you are taking part in research, or about genetic test results. However, when applying for insurance you do have to disclose any symptoms you experience or any diagnoses, screening, or treatments you receive, if this information is requested on the application form.







1. Is identifiable data held separately and more securely?







Direct identifiers, such as name and date of birth, will be held in a separate part of the data infrastructure. This part of the data infrastructure will be more secure, in the sense that it will not be accessible to researchers; nor, indeed, will it be accessible to the majority of Genomics England staff. Given the sensitive nature of the health and genome data, similar expectations of security apply across the whole of the data infrastructure.
In the rare cases where Genomics England staff need access to identifiable data, access will only be granted following explicit approval from Genomics Englands Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO). Access to identifiable data will be strictly limited and protected. All actions can be audited and monitored.





2. What sanctions and penalties are in place for misappropriate use of the data?







Maintaining data security and protecting the privacy of participants is of the upmost importance to Genomics England.
Any researcher who attempts to re-identify data (and thus identify a participant) runs a significant risk of detection. Genomics England has penalties in place for any organisation or individual who breaches or attempts to breach a participants identity confidentiality. 
Penalties for misappropriate use include revocation of user access, withdrawal of access for the organisation the offending user is employed or contracted to, and the reporting of the offending activity to the Information Commissioner which could result in a fine of up to 500,000 or even imprisonment under section 55 of the Data Protection Act.





3. What is the difference between anonymised and pseudonymised data?







The Information Commissioner (ICO) defines anonymisation as the process of turning data into a form which does not identify individuals and where identification is not likely to take place. The ICO also has a . There is no standard definition for pseudonymised, and the two words are often used to mean the same thing. There is one, key, technical difference, in that anonymised can be used to refer to aggregate data, or results, whereas pseudonymised can only refer to individual-level data, but this does not mean that pseudonymised data is easier to identify  it depends upon the data, and the context.
For Genomics England, only anonymised data can be exported from the secure environment: this may be aggregate, results data, or other data from which so much information has been removed that it is highly unlikely that it could be re-associated with individual participants.
Within the secure data system, the data available to researchers is de-identified in the sense that personal identifiers have been removed, together with any other information that is not needed for their specific, approved research purposes. More than this, a fresh, unique reference may be generated for each research purpose, so that researchers are not able to collect information about individuals across research studies.

A comprehensive catalog of somatic mutations and structural variations in lung cancer and correlation with main clinical characteristics





Project Lead

Shicheng Guo



Project Date

23/02/2023


Lay Summary


Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and a better understanding of the genetic changes that drive its progression is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The aim of this research plan is to study the frequency and association of lung cancer mutations and structural variations with clinical information, metastasis, drug response, and survival in the lung cancer patient cohort from the 100,000 Genomes Project. Whole Genome Sequences would provide more insights on non-coding regions of DNA, as compared with other sources of genomic data from cancer patients (e.g. TCGA and TARGET). Non-coding regions of DNA, which make up the majority of the human genome, play important roles in gene regulation, chromatin structure, and other biological processes. Mutations or structural variations in non-coding regions can affect gene expression and contribute to the development and progression of cancer. Therefore, studying non-coding regions of DNA can provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of cancer. In this study, Dr. Shicheng Guo, Dr. Christopher Moy, Dr. Joel Greshock, Dr. Ramzi Temmani and Dr. Tommaso Mansi will provide a comprehensive understanding of the genetic changes that drive lung cancer progression and contribute to its resistance to current therapies. The identification of biomarkers of drug response and survival will support clinical trial development and facilitate the development of personalized medicine approaches and improve patient outcomes and benefit lung cancer patient. Overall, the research plan has the potential to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes for patients with lung cancer. By contributing to a better understanding of the molecular basis of the disease, your research can help advance precision medicine and improve the quality of care for patients.

Validation and Expansion of Synthetic Lethal Cancer Targets Using the Genomics England Dataset





Project Lead

Shicheng Guo



Project Date

22/02/2023


Lay Summary


Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and the development of effective treatments is of utmost importance. Synthetic lethal-based drug development is a strategy for developing cancer treatments that focuses on targeting specific genetic alterations in cancer cells that are not present in normal cells. This approach takes advantage of the unique vulnerabilities of cancer cells, which often have specific genetic changes that make them more dependent on certain cellular processes. By targeting these processes, synthetic lethal-based drugs can selectively kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed. However, the most current synthetic lethal targets are not fully validated yet, so we aim to do exactly this, validating these targets in the population cohort of cancer participants from the 100,000 Genomes Project. In this project, team of Dr. Shicheng Guo, Dr. Christopher Moy, Dr. Tim Schultz, Dr. Kirti Snigdha, Dr. Barbara Weir, Dr. Yu Sun, Dr. Ramzi Temmani, Dr. Tommaso Mansi and Dr. Joel Greshock will be able to improve our understanding of synthetic lethal targets and their potential for cancer drug development. By validating the findings in this large human population, we will be able to better evaluate the clinical relevance of synthetic lethal targets and expand our knowledge of their potential as cancer treatments . This will inform our drug discovery programmes in this field, to ensure we pursue R&D to develop medicines around synthetic lethal targets that are confirmed to be relevant for cancer patients in the UK.

Predictive modeling of Brain metastases in patients diagnosed with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer using clinical-genomic real-world data





Project Lead

Alvaro Ulloa



Project Date

22/02/2023


Lay Summary


Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US. Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 84% of all lung cancers. Patients diagnosed with NSCLC and Brain metastasis (BM) have poor prognoses, with median survival ranging between 4 and 6 months. Both early diagnosis and intervention may improve patient outcomes. Amivantamab + Lazertinib is a combination therapy for the treatment of certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Amivantamab is an anti-PD-L1 antibody, a type of immunotherapy, while Lazertinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets specific genetic mutations found in NSCLC. The combination of these two drugs works to block the growth and spread of cancer cells. Janssen is currently assessing the effectiveness of Amivantimab + Lazertinib on advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who haven't received any previous treatment and whose tumors harbor select EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or L858R) in the MARIPOSA trial whose main goal is to see how long patients can go without their cancer getting worse, which is known as progression-free survival (PFS). Given that the intervention is found to be effective, we hypothesize that prophylactic treatment with Amivantimab + Lazertinib targeting patients with a high risk of developing brain metastasis within 2 years may further improve patient outcomes. This will help oncologists make better decisions about treating these patients in the future. To support this trial, we have developed a model using clinical and genomic information from Concert AIs Genome 360 database. In this study, Dr. Alvaro Ulloa, Dr. Amanda Zheutlin, Dr. Yi Zhang, Dr. Kaitlin Hood, Dr. Breno Neri, and Dr. Shicheng Guo plan to analyse the genomic and clinical data from the (Non-small cell lung) cancer participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project to validate the performance estimates for brain metastases in patients diagnosed with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer using clinical-genomic real-world data. This study will be important to support our clinical trial to prevent brain metastases from happening in these high-risk patients.

Characterisation of the contribution of genetics in influencing cancer outcomes and treatment response





Project Lead

Athena Matakidou



Project Date

21/02/2023


Lay Summary


Cancer is a disease that shows great variability in how patients respond to therapies and their overall prognosis (survival). This variability is not limited to different cancer types but is also seen within patients with the same diagnosis, with few clinically relevant biomarkers currently available to guide treatment choices. This project aims to explore how genetic variation, both inherited (germline) or acquired (cancer/somatic) impacts response to commonly used anti-cancer therapies and patients outcomes, by analysing the clinical and genetic data of cancer participants in the 100,000 Genomes Programme , found in the National Genomic Research Library (NGRL). The results may help identify novel biomarkers of treatment response as well provide insights into genes and pathways for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies.

Assessing the public health impact of endogenous viral elements in the human population





Project Lead

Gkikas Magiorkinis



Project Date

19/02/2023


Lay Summary


Deep analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data has become a major asset in characterizing mobile genetic elements in humans. Yet, one large order of these elements  the endogenous viral elements (EVEs)- are integrations of partial or full-length viral genomic material into the host genome. These insertions are vertically inherited and can confer an advantageous or deleterious phenotype in humans. Thus, it is of critical importance to identify those viral genetic imprints and investigate their biological functions. In this project, we aim to deeply analyze a massive volume of human genome data in order to identify and characterize novel viral integrations. Through sophisticated bioinformatic algorithms, the project will catalogue novel polymorphic EVEs integrations, estimate their frequency in the human population and assess their public health impact.

Exploring the role of rare non-coding variation in breast cancer risk





Project Lead

Douglas Easton



Project Date

16/02/2023


Lay Summary


The risk of cancer, including breast cancer, can be influenced by inherited genetic changes. The human genome is made up of genes, which code for proteins, and other non-coding DNA that does not code for proteins. The non-coding DNA can still serve important functional roles, such as regulating nearby genes. While the role of alterations in genes (such as BRCA1) in determining the risk of cancer, has been well studied, the role of the non-coding genome, particularly rare genetic changes, is much less understood. The role of this project is to investigate the role of rare alterations in non-coding DNA in determining breast cancer risk.

Characterisation of the pan-cancer epigenomic mutational landscape





Project Lead

Simon Furney



Project Date

10/02/2023


Lay Summary


Within cells, DNA is organised and packaged by protein complexes known as chromatin. Certain families of genes are responsible for controlling this packaging of DNA in chromatin. This allows genes to be expressed and translated into proteins, or repressed so that the genes are not expressed at the wrong time or in the wrong cell type. However, many of these genes that control these processes are mutated in cancer leading to abnormal chromatin (epigenomic) states. This in turn leads to abnormal expression or repression of other genes which contribute to cancer development. In this project, we aim to investigate the prevalence and consequence of mutations in the genes which control chromatin states. In order to do this, we will look at germline and tumour mutations in these genes in cancer patients genomes to try to understand which mutations are important and may lead to tumour development.

We are using an experimental technique, Saturation Genome Editing, to generate scores for assessing the severity for all possible genetic variants within genes. The maps we compile can be used by clinicians in the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance, facilitating diagnoses for those with genetic disease. The availability of variant data from affected populations is critical to compile accurate variant effect maps for the genes of interest. 
We plan to use the anonymised variant information from patients recruited as part of the Rare Disease Programme in GEL to establish the specificity and sensitivity of the variant maps we generate. We will identify and export de-identified DNA sequence variants present in specific genes with disease associations, along with their inheritance status. These variants will be tested in our functional assay alongside hundreds of other SNVs, and will then serve as positive control variants in the analysis of our experimental data, and thus help establish the efficacy of our maps to disambiguate previously uninterpretable variants. We anticipate performing this data extraction for approximately 10 genes per month, for a total of around 300 genes. This work will be carried out by the Hurles Group ().

Comparative medical genetics to facilitate the interpretation of rare variation





Project Lead

Bushra Haque



Project Date

02/02/2023


Lay Summary


Reading entire DNA sequences of individuals provides a comprehensive view of the unique genetic variation that contributes to a range of diseases, from rare genetic disorders to common cancers. Genetic variants create changes of the genetic code that often negatively impact proteins that DNA code for and cause harmful effects. However, distinguishing rare variants that cause disease from the majority that have no consequences remains a challenge. This study aims to develop and test a new approach for determining if rare variants are associated with human disease. An area that has not been investigated is the overlap between germline DNA variants that cause genetic disorders in humans and variants in other contexts. Germline variants refer to changes that are incorporated into the DNA of every cell in the body that are often inherited from the egg and sperm cells during conception. Examples of variants in other contexts include somatic variants, that occur in specific cell types and cause cancer, or non-human animal variants. 
This study aims to explores this further by extracting variants from databases, such as cancer mutation databases and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA). Several hundreds of these disease-causing variants were extracted from these databases and will be queried in human germline databases including ClinVar and the GEL database. Since these variants are the same, there is a clear functional consequence of these variants in other contexts that can be used to interpret their impact in human genomes that cause germline disease. This data will help to improve the way we interpret novel rare variants to be disease-causing in humans and improve clinical diagnosis to allow better treatment and health outcomes.

Genetic determinants for healthcare costs - genCOST consortium





Project Lead

Andrea Ganna



Project Date

31/01/2023


Lay Summary


Healthcare costs continue to rise worldwide, and in 2018, global healthcare spending reached $8.3 trillion, or 10% of the global gross domestic product. Accurate measurement of healthcare costs associated with different risk factors and health outcomes is important to prioritize public health promotion and prevention programs. Moreover, healthcare utilization, and associated healthcare costs, can be used to compare the impact of risk factors on individual health burden in a disease-agnostic manner. Thus, analysis of healthcare costs is of significant interest from an epidemiological, public health, and policy perspective.
In this project we aim to study the impact of genetic factors on healthcare cost. There are three major motivations. First, healthcare costs can provide an objective measure of morbidity. Thus, genetic associations with healthcare costs can help identify biological pathways that are implicated in overall health maintenance. Second, implementation of genetic-based screening tools in a clinical setting requires cost-effectiveness evaluations. Estimating the relationship between genetic risk factors and healthcare costs can help estimating the cost-effectiveness of novel genetic-based interventions. Third, genetic associations with healthcare costs can be used to inform the causal relationship between modifiable risk factors and healthcare costs using statistical genetic approach.

Quality Control of somatic calls from whole-genome sequencing





Project Lead

Giulio Caravagna



Project Date

11/01/2023


Lay Summary


The prelude to interpret cancer genomes is to generate good-quality sequencing data. With the advent of high-resolution whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data we are seeing the flourishing of many distinct bioinformatics algorithms to call somatic mutations (and more complex alterations) from WGS data, but Quality Control (QC) algorithms for such calls are still missing. These algorithms are fundamental to flag good-quality from bad-quality data, eventually refining data-quality until desired criteria are met. In this project we will use the wealth of pan-cancer data at Genomics England to to develop and test new QC algorithms for WGS data, allowing researcher to get the best out of their sequencing datasets.

Genotyping MUCs VNTR linked to Ovarian cancer/fertility using Whole Genome Sequencing





Project Lead

Steven Conlan



Project Date

10/01/2023


Lay Summary


Mucin (MUC) proteins are large proteins that contain repeating subunits called variable number tandem repeat regions (VNTR) that are decorated with sugar molecules (glycosylated). They are found throughout the body, including in the uterus (womb) and ovaries. We are proposing to investigate the relationship between the VNTR length of two proteins MUC1 and MUC16 in relation to fertility and cancer making use of 100k genomes project.
 
The fertility part of the project would investigate MUC1 VNTR length linked to fertility status (number of pregnancies). Despite thorough investigation many cases of infertility remain unexplained. Although normal embryos are transferred in most in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) successful pregnancy only takes place in about one in five attempts. Failure of implantation of the embryo is probably the reason for the lack of success. The level of MUC1 increases after ovulation and persists during implantation. High genetic variation in the number of VNTRs is a characteristic of MUC 1, and we will test whether this variation could be linked to pregnancy outcome.
In the ovarian cancer part of the project we would look at VNTR length in MUC16 as it is the ovarian cancer biomarker known as CA125. CA125 is not always a reliable diagnostic marker for ovarian cancer (although it is the best marker we have, and is excellent in monitoring ovarian cancer treatment response). We think that false positive CA125 tests could be due to VNTR length (genetic variation), and knowing the relationship between MUC16 VNTR length and MUC16 (CA125) levels could give a better risk score for ovarian cancer diagnosis/detection.

Additional Findings Evaluation: health economic analysis





Project Lead

Lyn Chitty



Project Date

09/01/2023


Lay Summary


100,000 Genomes Project participants were asked if they wanted additional health information to be looked for in their genome sequence, known as 'additional findings'. For those who said yes, gene alterations or spelling mistakes were looked for in a specific list of genes that could increase the risk of developing certain health conditions. These alterations are rare - it is expected that about 1 in 100 participants will have one of these findings - but for this small of people number steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of the health condition developing, or the condition can be treated or monitored. 
The process of looking for 'additional findings' and the steps or treatments which may follow a new finding will come with extra costs to the NHS and the patient. It may also bring benefits from taking early action to treat, or reduce the risk of, a health condition. It is import to assess both the potential costs and benefits to help decide whether or not we should look for 'additional findings' in NHS patients, including whether it will be a good use of tax payer money. This project will use standard health economics methods to carry out this assessment.

Genomics England privacy notice


Our privacy notice gives general information about who we are, what we do and who to contact if you want more information (such as to exercise your information rights), as well as more detail about how we use your personal data.
























General information


Genomics Englands priority is to ensure that the data of all participants and everyone it deals with is protected  and that we are fully compliant with the latest data protection legislation.






Who we are and what we do


Genomics England is a limited company wholly owned by the Department of Health and Social Care (company registration 08493132). 
We were created to run the 100,000 Genomes Project, a project instigated by former Prime Minister David Cameron in order to research cancers and rare diseases. That project has now come to an end. The Project is transitioning to where the main source of recruitment, sample and data acquisition, and mechanism for return of results will be via the NHS Genomic Medicine Service (NHS GMS).




What we use your personal data for


Genomics England processes personal data for a number of reasons. These include:
research,providing the NHS Genomic Medicine Service (NHS GMS),recruitment,using this website,organising conferences andproviding access to our research environment to other research institutions and businesses.Genomics England is a data controller, and we are registered with the Information Commissioners Office (ICO), registration number ZA021653. 















Valid from 17 June 2022

To find out about how we use your personal data, click to expand the section that relates to you below.








Youve had a test through the NHS Genomic Medicine Service











This page is valid from 17 June 2022
The NHS Genomic Medicine Service (NHS GMS) is the arm of the NHS working to enable the NHS to harness the power of genomic technology and science to improve the health of our population.
If you're a patient of the NHS Genomic Medicine Service, you may be offered whole genome sequencing as part of your clinical care. You will be asked if you want to donate genome sequence and health data, and/or your sample (blood/saliva/tissue, etc.), for research.
If you agree, your samples will be stored securely and your data will be added to the National Genomic Research Library. This is a secure national database of pseudonymised genomic and health data managed by Genomics England. NHS England, on behalf of the hospitals (Trusts) that provided your genomic test, will allow Genomics England to access your identified data to link you to the National Genomic Research Library. Genomics England then pseudonymise your linked data so that approved researchers can use the pseudonymised samples and data to study diseases and look for new treatments. Their research might help you and others now or in the future.
Genomics England Ltd is a Data Controller under data protection legislation for the purposes of the National Genomic Research Library. 
Genomics England process the following types of Personal Data:
Patient Identifiers including NHS NumberDemographics  name, address, date of birth, ethnicity, registered GPClinical pathway  this is a tool which helps clinicians guide a patient's treatment to make sure the care provided is consistent.Family identifiers  where relevant. This may identify one or multiple people in your family group where it is relevant to your health record.Clinical Indicators  nature of condition, details of conditionClinical measurements and observations relevant to condition specific to cancer or rare and heritable disease pathwaysClinical ethnicity and clinical sex detailsDetails of genomic testing and related procedures  e.g. the type of test performedLink to previous requests and testsWhole Genome Sequence  this is your DNA sequence recorded in a computer file.Health records
Genomics England process the following types of Special Categories of Personal Data:
Racial or ethnic originGenetic dataHealth data
All data that goes into the research environment is pseudonymised.
What does pseudonymised data mean?
Pseudonymisation means that we take information which would identify you directly out of the data, such as name, address, date of birth and NHS number, and replace them with a unique identifier that only we at Genomics England can use to re-identify you. Researchers that are given access to the Library do so under strict agreements and their access is reviewed by our Access Review Committee, which includes patient and participant representatives. Researchers must also have approval for their study prior to access being granted. The data can only be viewed by researchers, it cannot be taken out of the research environment without permission. You can read more about the Committee .
Due to the detailed nature of the data it can never be truly anonymised, there is always a small risk that an individual may recognise your specific rare condition or other aspects of your health. This is because some clinicians also have access to the Library to conduct research they themselves are involved in. 
Lawful basis
For us to use your data, we must identify a lawful basis in the General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) on which to process it. Below are the lawful bases we use.
Type of data and purpose 
Personal data (Article 6 UK GDPR) 
Special category data (Article 9 UK GDPR)
