The digital transformation strategy of the European Union has, among others, a particular priority: the creation of common data platforms based on a unified architecture and an established standard. As part of the Horizon 2020 programme, the OPEN DEI project focuses on Platforms and Pilots to support the implementation of next generation digital platforms in four basic industrial domains: manufacturing, agriculture, engergy, healthcare.

the EU-funded OPEN DEI project aims to detect gaps, encourage synergies, support regional and national cooperation, and enhance communication among the Innovation Actions implementing the EU Digital Transformation strategy.

A number of platforms, and associated ecosystems, have been developed during the last ten years in each of the specific sectors covered by OPEN DEI. Several are evident in the field of healthcare. Of importance to platforms are the platform-related activities identified as the six Ps by OPEN DEI. Besides platforms, the other five are: products, processes, people, partnership(s), and performance. In healthcare, various platforms have emerged at European level since 2010 and have developed their own ecosystem, including the following: EPSOS, ACTIVAGE, UniversAAL, AEGLE

Manufacturing Sector









Manufacturing Sector2022-03-09T09:10:18+01:00 
The MANUFACTURING SectorOPEN DEI will be an essential pillar of the implementation of EU digitisation policies by addressing in particular the support to the currently ongoing Large-Scale Pilots (LSPs) and platform projects financed by the European Commission under the Digitising European Industries (DEI) Focus Area working in different strategic sectors: one of them is the manufacturing domain.
DescriptionManufacturing represents about 15% of total EU value added and accounts for 2 million companies and 33 million direct jobs. A key sector in the European market but not anymore the provider of plenty of unskilled jobs that used to be in the past. 
European manufacturing competitiveness needs a continuous development and implementation of large-scale experimentation pilots, reference architecture and open data platform to drive and coordinate global standards development for Industry 4.0.
OPEN DEI will give support and enhance the impact of the Innovation Actions that, under the framework of the Digital Transformation, are addressing the following challenge:

Agile Value Networks for lot size 1 production: to design / manufacture customized products through more dynamic solutions

Excellence in manufacturing: Data driven products and services to implement Zero Defect Manufacturing in Industry 4.0

The human factor: designing the future workplace enhancing the collaboration between humans and autonomous systems

Sustainable Value Networks: applying the principles of circular economy to manufacturing processes
A further common challenge is the shift from classic production jobs towards higher value-added types of jobs, OPEN DEI will support this shift with the preparation of a catalogue of skills and training activities for the digital reskilling and upskilling of European manufacturing workforce.
OPEN DEI Next StepsFirst step is to start working with the Innovation Actions already running to collect requirements / needs and first results, with a focus on the reference architecture and pilots, and transfer them to OPEN DEI for cross-domain awareness channels. OPEN DEI will soon produce some questionnaires and templates to be circulated to the relevant projects in the four Digital Transformation domains as well as look for cross-domain collaborations and dissemination events.
OPEN DEI ProjectsManufacturing
QU4LITY
QU4LITY will demonstrate an open SME-friendly shared data-driven ZDM product and service model for Factory 4.0 through 5 strategic ZDM lighthouse equipment pilots and 9 production lighthouse facility pilots. QU4LITY will also demonstrate how European industry can build ZDM strategies and competitive advantages (increasing efficiency, reducing scrap, avoiding defect propagation) through an orchestrated open platforms ecosystem and digital enablers across all phases of product and process lifecycle (engineering, planning, operation and production) building upon the QU4LITY autonomous quality model to meet the Industry 4.0 ZDM challenges.

European Factory Platform
European Connected Factory Platform for Agile Manufacturing

The European Factory Platform project realises a federated smart factory ecosystem by primarily interlinking 4 smart factory platforms, from the FoF-11-2016 cluster, through an open and interoperable Data Spine. The federation of the 4 base platforms is complemented by industrial platforms, collaboration tools and smart factory systems, specifically selected to support connected factories in lot-size-one manufacturing. The federated European Factory Platform delivers enhanced value and reduces the barrier to innovation by providing seamless access to services and solutions that are currently dispersed. In parallel the platform provides the necessary infrastructure, tools and support for novel service creation and validations by third parties. The creation of the European smart factory ecosystem is supported by offering technical and financial support to companies who are interested in using the European Factory Platform to enhance their businesses.
CloseManufacturing
Connected Factories
Pathways to Digitalisation of Manufacturing
The ConnectedFactories project establishes a structured overview of available and upcoming technological approaches and best practices with regard to the digitalisation of Manufacturing. The project identifies present and future needs, as well as challenges, of the Manufacturing industries. The project explores pathways to the digital integration and interoperability of Manufacturing systems and processes and the benefits this will bring.
The ConnectedFactories 1 project has produced the baseline versions of three pathways to the digitalisation of manufacturing:

Autonomous Smart Factories
Hyperconnected Factories
Collaborative Product-Service Factories

The ConnectedFactories 2 project (started on 1 December 2019) focuses on:

Creating a common understanding of key enablers and cross-cutting factors for the development and deployment of digital technologies and digital platforms for Manufacturing
Deepening pathways by taking into account legacy systems, industrial requirements and challenges
Situating inspiring research and industrial state-of-the-art cases, key enablers and cross-cutting factors along these pathways
Matching of skills transfer offering with skills demand across Europe

Agrifood Sector









Agrifood Sector2022-03-08T20:00:05+01:00 
The AGRI-FOOD SectorOPEN DEI will be an essential pillar of the implementation of EU digitisation policies by addressing in particular thesupport to the Large-Scale Pilots (LSPs) and platform projectsfinancedby the European Commission under the Digitising European Industries (DEI) Focus Area and currently ongoing, which work in different strategic sectors: one of them is represented byagri-food.
DescriptionThe food industry is usually considered to be an industry with low research intensity (Charis M. Galanakis, 2016).Farmers and food companies are slower in adopting digital technologies in comparison with other sectors and are just starting adopting and standardising digitisation at proper scale. Innovation and investments in technologies and ICT are differently interpreted according to the company size, but also according to the propensity of the owners. 
Nevertheless, the Agri-food sector as a whole (from the fields to the shelves of shops and supermarkets, and catering) remains one of the most important sectors of the current economy and fundamental to face the challenge of food security in the upcoming years. For this reason, the Agri-food sector cannot allow itself to lose the opportunities offered by digitisation. 
Agriculture contributed 1.1% to the EUs GDP in 2018 (Eurostat) and, according to Data & Trends 2019 (FoodDrinkEurope, 2019), the EU food and drink industry employs 4.72 million people, generates a turnover of 1.2 trillion and 236 billion in value added, making it the largest manufacturing industry in the EU and the biggest manufacturing employer in half of the EUs 27 Member States plus the UK. Just as an example, the agri-food sector value in Italy corresponds to 25% of the Italian GDP (a quarter of the wealth generated in Italy, therefore, is linked to the production and sale of food and drinks).
In general terms, it is necessary to make farms and food industries in Europe aware of digitalisation advantages and benefits, in particular by providing them with success stories and/or testing with them how a technology can concretely be useful. The relationship technology provider  Agri-food company is fundamental, to analyse the single case and to realise solutions customised to the specific needs and requirements of the firm.
But some solutions are needed also for those companies which already embraced the Digital Transformation and intend to continue on this path, since some pending issues have not been faced and solved yet. Just as an example, some Agri-food companies (mainly the multinational ones, less the small ones) already embraced digitalization in the last years for different purposes (e.g. to optimise internal operations, for traceability, to manage the warehouse, for logistics and transportation, etc.) and a lot of data are there (generated by the technologies applied inside the company or along the supply chain at the different levels of the food system). However, very often big data remain useless if the company is not able to manage/interpret them (transforming such data into useful information); analytics instruments and skills are needed for managing such a mass of data and to structure the companies in order to get the maximum advantage. In addition, interoperability among different systems and devices cannot still be guaranteed, limiting the success of Digital Transformation from potential users point of view.
The opportunity

to create a trust environment on new technologies; 

to foresee the introduction of standards for the data management and exchange of information;

to test/validate interoperability solutions (among Platforms and informative systems) 
is a desideratum, but not a reality yet in this sector. It is necessary to show farmers the opportunities offered by digitisation in their specific context, informing and training them on which applications, already available, are the most effective to meet their production needs (including also decision support systems) and to put farmers in the conditions to have access to such innovations, in the full respect of cyber security in terms of data sharing and re-use of data.

Starting in November 2020
OPEN DEI ActivitiesTo date, two H2020 Innovation Actions, ATLAS and DEMETER (DT-ICT-08) and some other pre-existing more mature projects, IoF2020 IoT LSP, SmartAgriHubs and AgROBOFood (DT-ICT-02), for a total of 5+ projects all working in the agriculture sector, represent the Agri-food Ecosystem of OPEN DEI. OPEN DEI will integrate also the winner of the DT-ICT-09-2020 Call (the Commission recently informed the applicants about the evaluation results for their proposals; it is expected that the first grant agreements will be signed by mid-December 2020) considering then its Ecosystem completed.
The mechanism of collaboration activated by OPEN DEI and the Ecosystems projects foresees, on the one hand, the set up and animation of Working Groups (WGs) on specific topics required by the projects themselves. Such WGs should be intended as stable groups of people experienced in common issues which discuss among them along regular meetings for making emerge opportunities. OPEN DEI offers a support in practical terms for managing such inter-projects meetings and material exchange (rapporteur, repository, mailing list).
On the other side, exploiting the cross-domain nature of OPEN DEI Action, the main goal of OPEN DEI Agri-food Ecosystem is to populate with agri-food experts the leading community of targeted Task Forces (TFs) launched on specific topics, guided by experienced people from OPEN DEI Consortium, with different iterations which will include meetings, consensus meetings and a final strategic outcome (e.g. White Paper). With TFs, OPEN DEI intends to open a debate and collaborative work environment among cross-domain IAs, where OPEN DEI can validate its original knowledge assets (Platform, Pilots, Ecosystem, Standards) in close co-operation with the representatives of the four domains.
Agri-food domain is led by , an Italian non-profit research organisation active in the Agri-food supply chain since almost 40 years, very close to farmers and food producers needs.

Energy Sector









Energy Sector2022-03-09T07:16:20+01:00 
The ENERGY SectorOPEN DEI will be an essential pillar of the implementation of EU digitisation policies by addressing in particular thesupport to the currently ongoing Large-Scale Pilots (LSPs) and platform projectsfinancedby the European Commission under the Digitising European Industries (DEI) Focus Area working in different strategic sectors: one of them is theEnergydomain.
DescriptionThe global energy system is experiencing a revolutionary transition from the present single-carrier, fossil-based status towards an integrated, low-carbon and market-based one.
Due to the increasing complexity, there is an urgent need to unlock smart technologies and services to ensure secure, reliable, resilient, accessible and cost-efficient solutions.
In the next future, the Integrated Energy Systems (IES) will consist of four inter-connected and inter-related layers:

The market layer, to allow for exchanges between market players (generators, aggregators, consumers and any other player).

The communication layer, to support the vertical and horizontal integration of energy systems and the relaying of information with the market.

The physical system layer, which consists of automated energy infrastructures (generation, power conversion, storage and networks) designed to meet citizen needs.

The digital infrastructure layer, which supports network operations to manage the integrated energy systems with higher levels of automation.
DigitalisationDigitalisation has become the main tool and driver of the power system transition and therefore requires central priority. It has three main components:

Information is generated and collected by connected devices.

Analytics are used to generate information to support network operators and market stakeholders.

Connectivity allows for the exchange of massive data between humans, devices and machines.
This complexity requires higher levels of operational excellence with the adoption of disrupting technologies to foster cross-domain data sharing and data-driven innovation. In this context a standardized software platform is the key enabler of interoperability and main vehicle for a rapid implementation of innovative energy services. OPEN DEI will evaluate, analyse and propose reference platforms that will constitute the basis of the four IES layers.
Particular attention is assigned to the open source platforms, for which FIWARE framework provides software components that are open source, easy adoptable and that can be assembled together with other third-party platform components to accelerate implementation of smart internet-related applications.
The amount of data that is exchanged between different domains and levels of the energy systems is continuously increasing and requires effective measures to be managed.
The following key elements in data management, in support of a data economy, need to be fulfilled:
Data model/Semantics
Data model/Semantics: definition of an appropriate data model beyond a single sector is a key ingredient for interoperability.
Data Sovereignty
Data Sovereignty: the ability of a data owner to define what a third party is allowed to do with his data.
Security
Security: systems must be immune to cyber-attacks even under strong growth of IoT and rapid changes in digital technologies and decentralisation.
Open API
Open API: closed solutions will not create a real open and competitive market. Open APIs offer the perfect bridge between private infrastructure spaces.
These aspects will be investigated by OPEN DEI in defining the recommendations and optimal specifications of platforms for energy sector.
Among these properties, interoperability plays a key role in the future systems: it allows the user to be independent in managing the own architectures/devices and guarantees the integration of each component in the deployed solution. 
A main aspect corresponds to the specification of a common data exchange format. In this context, SAREF (Smart Appliance REFerence ontology) is a shared model of consensus that facilitates the matching of existing assets (standards/protocols/datamodels/etc.) in the smart appliances domain. The use of SAREF provides building blocks that allow separation and recombination of different parts of the ontology depending on specific needs. The complete mapping of energy services to SAREF is an effective support to enhance applicability of proposed architectures.
Additionally, it is necessary to identify and promote standard protocols, information models and data models related to each different level of the energy systems, to ensure successful deployment of implemented services.
OPEN DEI ProjectsEnergy
PLATONE 
PLATform for Operation of distribution Networks.
Modern power grids are moving away from centralised, infrastructure-heavy transmission system operators (TSOs) towards distribution system operators (DSOs) that are flexible and more capable of managing diverse renewable energy sources. DSOs require new ways of managing the increased number of producers, end users and more volatile power distribution systems of the future. PlatOne project is using blockchain technology to build a platform to meet the needs of modern DSO power systems, including data management. The platform is built with existing regulations in mind, and will allow small power producers to be easily certified so that they can sell excess energy back to the grid.

INTERCONNECT
Interoperable Solutions Connecting Smart Homes, Buildings and Grids
The EU energy market is conditioned by digitalisation. New rules and technological developments allow the proliferation of energy service providers in the EU member states with users having full knowledge and control over their appliances. However, interoperability represents a serious problem as a change of provider could mean the replacement of installations. The EU-funded InterConnect project proposes effective energy management using a resilient and practical ecosystem that is user-centric and market-driven. The project involves a range of specialised stakeholders, including advanced technology actors, manufacturers, providers and energy users. Via seven pilots, they will showcase an effective digital market for ensuring energy-efficiency at reduced costs that is beneficial to end-users.

BD4OPEM
BD4OPEM  Big Data for OPen innovation Energy Marketplace
Energy power systems face big challenges to cope with grid integration demands of an ever-increasing number of distributed generation and consumption devices in an interconnected world. Nowadays, old metering, operation and control devices are combined with smart systems with a huge amount of data being available yet unused or underused. This data offers a wide range of possibilities to improve existing energy services and creating new ones, all available in an Open Innovation Marketplace, and processed through an Analytic Toolbox. BD4OPEM will develop this Analytic Toolbox, based on Big data techniques, providing tools for enabling efficient business processes in the energy sector. By extracting more value from available data, a range of innovative services will be created in the fields of grid monitoring, operation and maintenance, network planning, fraud detection, smart houses/buildings/industries energy management, blockchain transactions and flexibility aggregation for demand-response. The project will demonstrate the above features in four large scale pilots with diverse distributed energy sources (e.g. PV, wind, hydro, EV, storage), while promoting the competitiveness and synergies of Sustainable innovations and IT Ecosystems in Europe.

OneNet
OneNet  One Network for Europe
While the electrical grid is moving from being a fully centralized to a highly decentralized system, grid operators have to change their operative business to accommodate for faster reactions and adaptive exploitation of flexibility. The topic has been subject of several research projects in the past years and reached a maturity that allows now the consideration of a final level, proposing an integrated view on the grid operations beyond the traditional barriers. OneNet aims at performing this critical step creating the conditions for a new generation of grid services able to fully exploit demand response, storage and distributed generation while creating fair, transparent and open conditions for the consumer. As result, while creating one network of Europe, the project aims to build a customer centric approach to grid operation. This ambitious view is achieved by proposing new markets, products and services and by creating a unique IT architecture. While a single platform for Europe is not thinkable, OneNet proposes innovative mechanisms of platform federation which are the key technical enablers for the proposed vision.

BD4NRG: Big Data for Next Generation Energy
Advancements in next-generation energy technologies will drastically transform how the world generates and consumes power. Starting with the decentralisation of the energy system, it is necessary to establish a fair and secure engagement between big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. To achieve this, there is a need for more standardisation of big data architectures for smart grids and regulatory frameworks that do not facilitate actual data sharing. The EU-funded BD4NRG project will develop a reference architecture for smart energy to align various architectures together with an interoperable AI-driven big data analytics framework. This will enable cross-stakeholders data-driven services and full interoperability of leading-edge big data technologies with smart grid standards and operational frameworks.
CloseOPEN DEI Next StepsFollowing the Energy domain workshop (held on April 6, 2020), the creation of four working groups has been agreed: Use-cases explorer, Data/Shared-infrastructures, Linking eco-systems and Technical topics. The action lines of each working group are being defined in individual meetings, together with cooperation with external stakeholders (such as BRIDGE Inititative, Linux Foundation Energy and ETIP-SNET) in the Energy sector.

Healthcare Sector









Healthcare Sector2022-05-17T11:50:12+02:00 
The HEALTHCARE SectorOPEN DEI will be an essential pillar of the implementation of EU digitisation policies by addressing in particular thesupport to the Large-Scale Pilots (LSPs) and platform projectsfinancedby the European Commission under the Digitising European Industries (DEI) Focus Area and currently ongoing, which work in different strategic sectors: one of them is thehealthcaredomain.
DescriptionInitial Digital Platforms in the Healthcare Sector
 The digitisation of the healthcare system has been underway since at least the 1990s but has evolved slowly due to a number of major barriers. The main ones to highlight are the complexity of healthcare systems, the nature of the patient-healthcare professional relationship, the resistance of clinicians to change the way they work, and legal and ethical issues such as privacy and the sensitivity of healthcare data. Hence, an active collaboration between the various stakeholders has always and still is a prerequisite for success. 
In the larger European area, the first large scale deployment of digital services in Healthcare was the implementation of electronic medical records (EMRs) in both primary care and hospitals in countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Israel and regions such as Andalusia (Spain) and Lombardy (Italy). EMRs have served as the foundation for the digital transformation of healthcare.
Over the past decadeOver the past decade, a number of national and regional governments have developed and implemented eHealth strategies which include national or regional Electronic Health Records (EHRs) aiming at ensuring continuity of care across the healthcare systems. The approaches for these digital platforms range from centralized or federated decentralized and distributed architectures.
In parallel, services such as electronic prescriptions have also been deployed on a large scale to address the question of data quality and consistency and administrative simplification.
Unfortunately, the organisational fragmentation of healthcare (into its different sectors, such as primary care secondary hospital care and long term care) and the differences in the organization of the health care systems (insurance based or not) continue to lead to similar fragmentation of digital systems in place. Other elements which have played a role in this fragmentation are: insufficient levels of investment in key infrastructure and infostructure building blocks, proprietary standards, insufficient coordination between authorities and the weight of legacy systems.
ChallengesTodays Challenges for the Digital Transformation of the Healthcare Sector
There are a number of current challenges facing the healthcare sector in terms of its ongoing digital transformation. These often relate to specific types of technologies.
In response to todays health care needs, mHealth offers a potential solution. It is playing a rapidly greater role in both health and social care, increasingly supplanting earlier technologies such as telemedicine and telehealth; in general, it enables communication among health care professionals and clinicians and patients using instant messaging and chat platforms such as WhatsApp. The challenge now is to integrate mHealth with existing EHRs platforms to become an integral part of the overall digital system and network.
Other potential areas (including technologies) for digitisation in health care that can be supported by open digital platforms, reference architectures, open solutions and trusted networks are:

Trusted big data solutions and cybersecurity for health and care and for a fair data economy in health and care;

Open eco-systems and related governance principles to support innovation in health and care;

Deployment of robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and autonomous systems for healthcare (including social robots);

Enabling cross-cutting technologies, e.g. testing devices, wearables, Internet of Things (IoT), to address healthcare at the point of need (in the community, at home or in the move).
Sector Specific PlatformsA number of platforms, and associated ecosystems, have been developed during the last ten years in each of the specific sectors covered by OPEN DEI. Several are evident in the field of healthcare. Of importance to platforms are the platform-related activities identified as the six Ps by OPEN DEI. Besides platforms, the other five are: products, processes, people, partnership(s), and performance. In healthcare, various platforms have emerged at European level since 2010 and have developed their own ecosystem, including the following:
EPSOSHealthcare
Epos
TheepSOS project(2011-2014) heralded significant progress in cross border care in EHRs and ePrescribing. epSOS, meaning Smart Open Services for European Patients, was a European large-scale pilot testing the cross-border sharing of certain health data: a summary of a patients most important health data in case of unplanned care (the patient summary) and the electronic prescription (ePrescription). The outcomes produced by epSOS have been further worked out by other projects and serve as basis for CEF-eHealth calls and the eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure (eHDSI).

UniversAAL project(2010-2014) was a Coordination and Support Action with the objectiveto make it easier for the ICT industry in Europe to develop and successfully deploy solutions for Ambient/Active Assisted Living (AAL). To achieve this, the project is developing an open standardized platform/specification on which the AAL service providers can quickly and cheaply build AAL services. Work continued in 2014-2018.
CloseAEGLEHealthcare
AEGLE
AEGLE(2015-2018) developed an innovative ICT solution addressing the whole data value chain for health. It was based on various technologies: cloud computing enabling dynamic resource allocation, High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures for computational acceleration and advanced visualization techniques.
CloseSignificant Innovation Policy Initiatives and Ecosystems in the DomainVarious ongoing innovation policy-oriented initiatives can potentially help overcome the organisational fragmentation and build sustainability of interactions in the field. They include the following list of initiatives and ecosystems:

which involves European Member States and regions, and include member countries from outside Europe;
, known as EIT-Health; 
;
The  and the joint action supporting its work (the current Joint Action being );
, which again involves a different combination of Member States and countries outside Europe;
.


Several of these initiatives  especially AAL, EIP on AHA, and the JPI MYBL together  are currently exploring the possibility of forming larger post-2020 partnerships: a co-written joint statement outlines their synergies.
Significant Standards Initiatives in the DomainFrom the beginning, electronic identification, interoperability and standardization have been and are still key issues. They have been addressed at national, international and European level e.g. with EU-funded projects aiming at enabling cross-border data exchange between these national and regional platforms. Several standardization initiatives, sometimes competing, have emerged at local, European and International levels. Recent efforts have tried to classify the standards against a reference framework and improve the usability of selected standards:

An eHealth Interoperability Framework (eEIF) has been defined and its refined version (ReEIF) has been adopted by the eHealth Network in November 2015. This common framework is a means for managing interoperability and standardisation challenges in the eHealth domain in Europe.
A Conformity Assessment Scheme (CAS) for Europe has furthermore been developed. It promotes the adoption and take-up of interoperability testing mechanisms for testing eHealth solutions against standards and profiles defined in the ReEIF.
The European Interoperability Framework (EIF) supported by the project ISA has also produced 47 cross-domain recommendations for the use of standards and specifications to set up interoperable digital public services.

Examples of standards initiatives and bodies in the healthcare domain include:

To support interoperability at syntactic level:
 HL7-FHIR
 HL7-CDA
 OPEN EHR
 CEN 13606

To support interoperability at semantic level:
 SNOMED-CT
 WHO classifications (ICD, ICNP,ICF)

GATEKEEPER
GATEKEEPER will connect healthcare providers, businesses, entrepreneurs, elderly citizens and the communities they live in, in order to originate an open, trust-based arena for matching ideas, technologies, user needs and processes, aimed at ensuring healthier independent lives for the ageing populations. 
By 2022, GATEKEEPER will be embodied in an open source, European, standard-based, interoperable and secure framework available to all developers, for creating combined digital solutions for personalised early detection and interventions that (i) harness the next generation of healthcare and wellness innovations; (ii) cover the whole care continuum for elderly citizens, including primary, secondary and tertiary prevention, chronic diseases and co-morbidities; (iii) straightforwardly fit by design with European regulations, on data protection, consumer protection and patient protection (iv) are subjected to trustable certification processes; (iv) support value generation through the deployment of advanced business models based on the VBHC paradigm.

SHAPES
SHAPES aims to create the first European open Ecosystem enabling the large-scale deployment of a broad range of digital solutions for supporting and extending healthy and independent living for older individuals who are facing permanently or temporarily reduced functionality and capabilities. SHAPES builds an interoperable Platform integrating smart digital solutions to collect and analyse older individuals health, environmental and lifestyle information, identify their needs and provide personalised solutions that uphold the individuals data protection and trust. Standardisation, interoperability and scalability of SHAPES Platform sustain increased efficiency gains in health and care delivery across Europe, bringing improved quality of life to older individuals, their families, caregivers and care service providers. SHAPES Large-scale Piloting campaign engages +2k older individuals in 15 pilot sites in 10 EU Member States, including 6 EIP on AHA Reference Sites, and involves hundreds of key stakeholders to bring forth solutions to improve the health, wellbeing, independence and autonomy of older individuals, while enhancing the long-term sustainability of health and care systems.

ADLIFE
ADLIFE aims to provide a solution for the integration of therapies and approaches targeting early detection and assessment of deterioration, advanced and well-coordinated care planning and integrated supportive care.
ADLIFE will deploy developed and validated personalised digital solutions for integrated supportive care based on H2020 projects C3-Cloud and power2DM tested in two health systems.
The project will prove that intelligent, collaborative digital solutions can enable care teams, patients and care givers to improve or better maintain health in patients with advance chronic disease.

FAITH
FAITH is an EU-funded research project that aims to provide an Artificial Intelligence application that remotely identifies and analyses depression markers, using Federated Learning, to predict negative trends in people that have undergone cancer treatment. This concept will provide healthcare providers with advanced warnings to allow timely intervention and allow cancer patients to be more aware of their mental health and thus improve their quality of life. 
FAITH is a 3-year project which started in January 2020, funded under the H2020 call H2020-SC1-DTH-2019 (Big data and Artificial Intelligence for monitoring health status and quality of life after the cancer treatment).
CloseHealthcare
AICCELERATE
Healthcare systems lack flexible Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions that allow hospitals to improve efficiency and the quality of patient care. Current solutions provide limited scalability and are confined to isolated applications. Scalable models that address data sharing, integration, privacy, and ethics are needed to ensure better adoption of AI in healthcare.
AICCELERATE is an innovative project that will boost hospital care through 3 concrete pilots that will be carried out in 5 European hospitals. These pilots will develop the existing digital solutions further to improve quality of health and care. Pilots will serve as a means to apply the already existing AI-based solution to different realities, demonstrating the scalability of the AICCELERATE model.
CloseHealthcare
AIDPATH
AIDPATH stands for AI powered, Decentralized Production for Advanced Therapies in the Hospital. In the EU project AIDPATH, researchers are developing a system for the production of so-called CAR-T cells for the treatment of cancer. It is capable of integrating patient-related data and biomarkers into the therapy process using artificial intelligence. The CAR-T cells are produced close to the patient, directly in the hospital. This will make it possible in the future to provide patients treatments specifically tailored to their needs much more quickly.
CloseHealthcare
HOSMARTAI
The main objective of HosmartAI is to promote an effective and efficient healthcare system transformation by the use of AI and robotics technological developments. To achieve this transformation, HosmartAI will create a common open Integration Platform with the necessary tools to facilitate and measure the benefits of integrating digital technologies in hospitals and care facilities. The platform will be validated through 8 large-scale Pilots, which also target advancements in cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular diseases, thoracic disorders, neurological diseases, ageing & elderly care, pregnancy.

TENDER
affecTive basEd iNtegrateD carE for betteR Quality of Life (TeNDER) is a multi-sectoral EU project. Together with users, TeNDER will develop and test an integrated care model for patients diagnosed with Alzheimers disease (and other forms of dementia), Parkinsons disease, and/or cardiovascular diseases. The key aims are to help extend patients independence safely and ease the burden of care, and to
facilitate communication across patients care provision systems.

ICU4COVID 

ICU4COVID is a Cyber-Physical System for Telemedicine and Intensive Care (CPS4TIC)  a medicine solution for well respond to COVID-19 further outbreaks or similar infectious diseases. The CPS4TIC consists of a telemedicine cockpit, a connector platform and smart hubs. The hub continuous real-time telemonitoring and smart care environment. The CPS4TIC is shaped for delivery of the level oftreatment that is needed for the individual patient in an effective, economic, and efficient manner. By integrated use of telemedicine, the time gain for diagnosis and treatment are significant. Thus, resources can be used more efficiently, and staff exposure will be further diminished.

CloseOPEN DEI Next StepsTopical priorities have been discussed and selected within the Healthcare cluster. They relate to dissemination, use cases, KPIs, architecture, standards and reusable components and GDPR. 5 Working groups, each led by a different project, have been created. Their first mission is to be able to provide initial information in order to describe the use cases and the associated requirements. This will allow then an informed discussion on the technical choices to be operated.
The OPEN DEI Large scale Pilots dashboard will give more visibility to what is domain specific and what can travel across domains, leveraging thus more synergy opportunities and creating new awareness. This is particularly true for reference architecture which increasingly need to be able to integrate data from Internet of Things or from other health determinants which are not healthcare specifics.

OPEN DEI Final Event Aftermovie and Presentations









OPEN DEI Final Event Aftermovie and Presentations

One milestone is coming to an end, another is just starting.
At the end of October, the conclusion of the OPEN DEI project in Brussels was accompanied by a one-day event.
The event proved once again that OPENDEI.eu in all its diversity has laid decisive cornerstones for a fast, fair and uniform digitization of internationally operating companies.
The outstanding project proves that it was an essential pillar of the implementation of digitizing European industry policies. The significant output of this strong collaboration is a strategic roadmap for digital transformation, data spaces and a recommendation how to move forward.
And the journey is not over yet. The foundation created by OPEN DEI will play a central role in the Data Spaces Support Centre, which aims to create a blueprint for data spaces. In this way, we can ensure that pan-European data spaces are compatible and interoperable from the outset to drive the data-driven digital transformation in the European Community.
All the presentations held during the event, can be checked here:


Have a look at what happened during the OPEN DEI Final Event in Brussels:

OPEN DEI communitys success celebration









OPEN DEI communitys success celebration




OPEN DEI strives to implement all efforts to benefit the target projects ecosystem in more than 35 projects in four domains: manufacturing, agriculture, energy and healthcare and beyond.




OPEN DEI has embraced the transformation of digitalization and supports the challenges and impacts of digital platforms and data platforms as well as data spaces. In addition, OPEN DEI supports data platforms to evolve into data spaces. To develop this task, we have defined two strategies:

Task Forces to collectively address mid to long term challenges initiated by current projects but to be fully implemented through next generation HEP or DEP initiatives (e.g. Data Spaces; Business Ecosystems; Twin Transition)
Working Groups that specifically address short term issues and contribute to the projects objectives and deliverables.





The final event of OPEN DEI will demonstrate the results achieved by the entire OPEN DEI community and will initiate interesting discussions on the topic of digital transformation in the 4 domains: Its opportunities and challenges.




We will briefly present the key enablers to support companies in their digital transformation:

Data spaces building blocks for co-creation
Building a data-driven business ecosystem
Architectures for digital platforms and interoperability
Impact of digital transformation on business





In an interactive workshop we will discuss the sustainability of the OPEN DEI results. We will provide an overview of where we are, what is missing and most importantly, how the missing challenges or gaps can be further worked on.




These conclusions will be an interesting input for the European Commission and a short report with recommendations.




The outcome of the event will be a strategic roadmap for digital transformation and data spaces and a recommendation how to move forward.




Rough outline of the agenda (draft):
9:30 Registration
10:00 Welcome address

 Open DEI      About Open DEIAligning Reference Architectures, Open Platforms and Large-Scale Pilots in Digitising European Industry
The digital transformation strategy of the European Union has, amongothers, a particular priority: the creation of common data platforms based on a unified architecture and an established standard. As part of theHorizon 2020 programme, the OPEN DEI project focuses on Platforms and Pilots to support the implementation of next generation digital platforms in four basic industrial domains:




Opening the eyes of European industry and society to the returns from Digital Transformation
ObjectivesOPEN DEI strives to implement all efforts for the benefit of the target projects ecosystem:
Task Forces to collectively address medium to long term challenges to be initiated by current projects but fully implemented by next generation HEP or DEP initiatives (e.g. Data Spaces; Business Ecosystems; Twin Transition)
Working Groups to specifically address short term issues and contribute to projects objectives and deliverables
DATA SHARING SPACESTask Force 1
Data spaces experts team up to define for the first time cross-sectoral and across initiatives the fundamental design principles to build data spaces.
Platform Building
Design Principles for Data Spaces originates by needs and discussions held at sector-specific working group level as well as the expert groups discussions and confrontations held for the birth of the white paper Design Principles for data spaces
Task Force 1 objectives:
Data Spaces design principles Knowledge Transfer and Cross-fertilisation between projects
To assess building blocks and identify implementations to harmonise the data spaces Building Blocks and create a building blocks catalogues.
To investigate the existing minimal viable data spaces, the implementation phases and commonalities. And provide guidelines for data spaces deployment
Task Force 1 activities:
First iteration  OPEN DEI Task Force 1 Iteration 1 brought together experts from four domains and various data spaces initiatives to collaborate and define the design principles for data spaces implementation in a unified way.
Design Principles for Data Spaces position Paper was published last April 2021. The paper is available on 
Position Paper  Design Principles for Data Spaces
OPEN DEI Task Force 1 brings together experts from four domains and various data spaces initiatives to collaborate and define the design principles for data spaces implementation in a unified way.

Second iteration Assessment of minimal viable data spaces and common building blocks for data spaces implementation. Identify best practices and publish a building blocks catalogue.
KoM and activities coordination with experts
Workshops organisation with OPEN DEI WG and projects for building blocks assessment and minimum viable data spaces identification.
Publication of a White Paper  Harmonization Canvas for building blocks and best practices for Data Spaces and creation of Building blocks catalogue.
CloseDATA-POWERED BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM BULDINGTask Force 2
TF2 is a Think Tank to come up with reference models that will consolidate a Position Paper to drive the data-powered Digital Transformation in the European Community.
Data-Powered Business Ecosystem
A pool of experts in the domain of Digiting European Industry (DEI) to discuss on the guiding principles to guarantee Business Continuity and Multilateral DVC development based on trust and data sovereignty
Task Force 2 objectives:
Provide common guidance with best practices and codes of conduct for stakeholders to develop and/or participate in data-driven digital business ecosystems and value chains, enhancing the use of emerging digital innovation tools for digital transformation.
Support OPEN DEI projects in maximizing the impact of their Digital Transformations in the four domains, facilitating the scaling-up, cross-domain replication and long-term sustainability of the business and data ecosystem built around the Digital Platforms.
Drive collaboration and align with other EU initiatives to bridge the current business interoperability gap, building on governance standards and industry agreements to facilitate access to DVC.
Task Force 2 activities:

Data Spaces for Energy, Home and Mobility










Data Spaces for Energy, Home and Mobility2022-10-25T13:47:52+02:00 
Project Description 
The European Commission has promoted the deployment of the Digitalisation of Energy Action Plan (DoEAP), in order to develop an efficient, competitive market for a digital energy infrastructure and digital energy services that are both cyber-secure and sustainable.
A central aspect of DoEAP is represented by the concept of Energy Data Spaces. Data exchange is crucial for emerging energy data services in the digital energy market and will help suppliers and energy service providers to innovate and cope with an increasing share of renewables in a more decentralised energy system.
This document addresses main issues of data exchange in the three interconnected key sectors: energy, buildings and mobility; the analyses focus on existing concepts of data formats and data standards, reflecting on how to facilitate data sharing across the different sectors based on a common data framework.
The foremost use cases of European projects and initiatives in the specific sector or at cross-sector level are presented, depicting the current state of data exchange deployments and identifying the necessary actions for the upcoming developments.
