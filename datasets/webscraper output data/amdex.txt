These can be digitally enforced, monitored and controlled. Enabling parties that wish to share data to be compliant with law, regulations and consortium policies.We do this by researching, testing and deploying a neutral infrastructure that provides and executes reliable data sharing agreements, which:…technology service providers can integrate into their products and services.…are language- and operating system agnostic, so users remain free to choose their IT infrastructure, development platform or programming model.The AMdEX infrastructure and agreements are not owned by a few parties but operate as a cooperative facility by all and for all.Read more about AMdEX.Why is data sharing needed?In the Information Age, data has the potential to drive growth, foster societal efficiency, and create fairer systems. However, several barriers hinder the realisation of these prospects. One of these is that only a small percentage of all data is actually used, shared and analysed. Because of uncertainty about security, privacy and other legal issues such as data ownership, organisations do not share data at all or resort to individual agreements for exchanging data. Which means we are missing big opportunities.Read more about AMdEX.Benefits of AMdEXAMdEX democratises data sharing, promotes data sovereignty, fosters innovation, and provides companies with cost savings, speed, and a competitive advantage in the data-driven landscape.Benefits for organisationsCost savings – AMdEX provides digital data-sharing agreements as a service, eliminating the need for costly manual work.High speed – AMdEX allows parties to quickly spin up secure and fair data-sharing solutions, replacing one-off solutions that take a long time to implement.Competitive edge – AMdEX enables companies to deploy and iterate faster with a focus on innovation, rather than managing infrastructure, giving them a competitive advantage in the market.Benefits for societyCreates a fair level playing field – AMdEX enables organisations with fewer resources to participate in complex and highly regulated data sharing collaborations, by making it easier to show that their (software) services are compliant with laws and regulations.Accelerates data sovereignty – AMdEX empowers data owners to maintain control over their data by enforcing rules for its use digitally, fostering data privacy and security.Accelerates innovation – by offering trust for data sharing, AMdEX encourages more organisations to share their data, leading to increased innovation and collaboration.Read more about AMdEX.USPs of AMdEXAMdEX stands out from existing data sharing solutions.
