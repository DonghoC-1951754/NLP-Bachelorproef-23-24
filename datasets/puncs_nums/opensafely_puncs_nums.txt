The ha updated warn invalid output marked moderatelysensitive projectyaml follow mean youll get accurate feedback running code locallySpecifically check moderatelysensitive output meet appropriate These currently areThe file must correct type able run job locally server file valid type ie must valid file extensionIf csv file must patientid column code still run log file onscreen summary text show warning run computer using opensafely command line tool still get output run live system via jobsopensafelyorg still run file available level If large handled way above unlikey occur running locally dummy data may happen run via jobsopensafelyorgFixing likely case marking file highlysensitive instead need moderatelysensitive may need process data bit more eg remove patientid column reduce sizeAs reminder policy moderatelysensitive senstitive output  check designed catch accidental misclassification output patient level data moderatelysensitiveAny question problems please let u know Stricter output path projectyamlUpdated  November Weve made change slightly restrict output file pathsSpecifically path must end file extension eg csv Previously wa possibly use trailing  character match file eg outputsdata still use  match group similar files must end pattern file extension eg outputsdatacsvNearly projectyaml file already explicit file extension output paths require change users user may need add explicit file extension order job run locally backends run locally ha updated warn need thisThere multiple motivation change main one want able inspect file type loading projectyaml allows u warn user trying mark moderatelysensitiveIt also stop accidentally capturing output file intended output which incurrs performance disk space costAny question problems please let

please look thisThe significant upgrade readr package   find changelog here see full list upgraded package Github here Automatically run failed dependency submitting jobsUpdated  September Previously submitting job run platform would reject request requested action dependency previously failedThis required user explicitly request failed dependency rerun wa cumbersome wa behaviour running action locally user machine opensafely run commandWe changed behaviour submit action run dependent action previously failed also scheduled run make submitting job simpler many casesFor context original design behaviour wa encourage user ensure code run succesfully locally submitting run real avoids overloading system job may fail anyway due code errors still important best practice strongly encourage user submitting jobsHowever resulted awkward workflow submitting batch jobs hence change Updated disclosure control guidanceUpdated  September We recently made update disclosure control guidance important researcher requesting release output review them made following changes summarised detail belowPull request User project organisation Event Logs addedUpdated  September OpenSAFELY
