Landscape Analysis ha progressively (2018, 2021) evolved towards complete strategic document including trend analysis first example RIs service impact specific areas. order underline strategic relevance Landscape Analysis, ESFRI ha decided de-couple LA Roadmap. According new ERA Action 8, ESFRI publish strategic LA report 2023, must provide framework next ESFRI Roadmap, contribute EOSC Strategic Research Innovation Agenda, promote development new research infrastructure services, including, needed, infrastructure clustering pan-European thematic interdisciplinary services. Competitiveness Council conclusion furthermore invited ESFRI perform comprehensive analysis European RI landscape aim identify existing synergy complementarities, expose persistent deficiencies, shortcoming gaps, propose improvement accessibility, networking, clustering, associating even merging European, national regional RIs, deeper integration fully functional interoperable European RI ecosystem. furthermore emphasised critical importance RIs achieving objective European Missions ESFRI guiding strategic development European RI landscape fostering RIs contribution implementation European Missions. reach level ambition, Landscape Analysis provide consolidated gap analysis based user needs. cover different domain multiple dimension across domain also include evolution need identify priority future developments. Landscape Analysis include RIs services, technology, instrumentation data aspects, well societal economic impact; cover national, European global scales. prepare ambitious report, ESFRI ha decided involve directly RIs main stakeholder could provide relevant information report.

Guaranteeing excellence Landmark label, ESFRI ha responsibility monitoring quality RIs listed ESFRI roadmap Landmarks. follow-up , pilot review four Landmarks assessing scientific status implementation, ESFRI ha set ad hoc . prepared final report containing general criterion Landmark RI assessment consideration implementing appropriate methodology future. report addressed various aspect Landmarks developed set KPIs. wa approved published ESFRI December 2019. ad hoc Working Group also recommended quality standard Key Performance Indicators (the RACER-Criteria)4 dialogue process RIs evaluating organisation define appropriate KPIs would time fulfil objective ESFRI assessment. order prepare implement fully consistent procedure monitoring ESFRI Landmarks, ESFRI ha set another working group, namely Monitoring Implementation Group, mandate propose methodology monitoring Landmarks ESFRI Roadmap. working group ha prepared , identified option implementation Landmark monitoring ESFRI provided direction development ESFRI monitoring framework uptake ESFRI monitoring approach beyond Landmarks. KEY FEATURES LANDMARK MONITORING PROCESS Landmark monitoring ESFRI ha following objectives: enabling regular exchange ESFRI Landmarks long-term development; assessing quality individual Landmark; identification possible problem supporting Landmarks take appropriate actions; gathering information performance, output impact Landmarks. Additionally, outcome Landmark monitoring exercise provide insight functioning European RI ecosystem whole contribute identification gap European landscape future opportunity RIs Europe. Landmark shall monitored regular interval five years.
