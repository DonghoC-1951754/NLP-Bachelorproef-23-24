U.S. Federal Bureau Investigations (FBI) defines economic espionage "the act knowingly targeting acquiring trade secret benefit foreign government, foreign instrumentality, foreign agent." According 2019 Situation Report Swiss Federal Intelligence Service (FIS): "Espionage driven variety different motif ha one aim. example, state strive, using information obtained intelligence services, gain fuller picture situation order improve effectiveness actions. furthermore observed information increasingly procured aim influencing (in so-called influence operations) damaging action rivals. achieved selective publication information. aim activity often weaken cohesion international group institution thereby restrict ability act." Cyber prefix used describe new thing possible result spread computers, systems, devices, interconnected. relates data processing, data transfer, information stored systems. word cyber also refer anything relating computers, systems, devices, especially internet. prefix cyber ha added wide range words, describe new flavor existing concepts, new approach existing procedures. Intelligence gathering involves human intelligence (HUMINT - information collected provided human sources), signal intelligence (SIGINT - information collected interception signals), imagery intelligence (IMINT), measurement signature intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), open-source intelligence (OSINT), financial intelligence (FININT), etc. HUMINT oldest form intelligence gathering. Cyber-HUMINT refers strategy practice used cyberspace, order collect intelligence attacking human factor. Cyber-HUMINT start traditional human intelligence process (recruitment, training, intelligence gathering, deception etc.), combined social engineering strategy practices. Cyber espionage includes: - unauthorized access system device obtain information, - social engineering person authorized access system devices, obtain information. Cyber espionage involves cyber attack obtain political, commercial, military information. Cyber espionage traditional espionage similar end goals. Cyber espionage exploit anonymity, global reach, scattered nature, interconnectedness information networks, deception opportunity offer plausible deniability. Economic industrial espionage, including cyber espionage, represents significant threat country prosperity, security, competitive advantage. Cyberspace preferred operational domain many threat actors, including countries, state sponsored groups, organized crime, individuals. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Internet Things (IoT) introduce new vulnerabilities. Cyber economic espionage targeting theft trade secret intellectual property. usually much larger scale scope, major drain competitive advantage market share. According Burton (2015), cyber threat classified four main categories: Cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyberterrorism, cyber warfare. Cybercrime crime enabled target computers. Criminal activity carried individual group diverse goal financial gain, identity theft, damaging property. Usually cybercrime financially motivated. Cyber espionage activity conducted state-sponsored cyber attacker "for purpose providing knowledge state obtain political, commercial, military gain" (Burton, 2015). According Denning, cyberterrorism convergence cyberspace terrorism" cover politically motivated hacking operation intended cause grave harm loss life severe economic damage. Cyber Warfare involves use computer system target enemy information systems. use cyber power military operation important force multiplier. Since armed force highly dependent information technology computer networks, disruption system would provide great advantages. Cyberspace regarded fifth domain warfare land, sea, air, space. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced June 2016 28-member alliance ha agreed declare cyber operational domain, much sea, air land are. According 2019 Situation Report Swiss Federal Intelligence Service (FIS): "Espionage operation come light reveal cyber tool communication reconnaissance instrument used parallel interaction human sources. Depending objective, information also procured exclusively via cyberspace. latter ha gained importance insofar use cyber-based information-gathering tool ha proven successful many actors. Cyber espionage difficult detect, perpetrator hardly successfully prosecuted, purported country origin doe course help elucidate affair determination mean intelligence origin cyber-attack (attribution) simply denied based lack provability." major challenge today lack awareness training. Many organization company continue believe cyber security technical, strategic discipline. believe cyber security involves protection system threat like unauthorized access, awareness training person authorized access system information.

Steganography business intelligence intellectual property theft, role Board. Overview Steganography art science concealing message, image, file within another message, image, file, communicating way hide existence message communication. example, message hidden inside graphic image file, audio file, file format, way difficult steganography expert impossible others find it. word steganography come Greek word (covered concealed) (write). Payload data ha hidden, carrier whatever (like file) hide payload. Steganography different cryptography. Cryptography art secret writing, make message unreadable third party, doe hide existence message. Steganography concealing message. relatively easy identify encrypted file, usually easy decrypt it. analyst might able identify encryption method examining file header, identifying encryption program installed system, finding encryption key (which often stored media). steganography, everything complex difficult. analyst must first find file hide another encrypted file (looking multiple version image, identifying presence grayscale images, searching metadata registries, using histograms, using hash set search known steganography software), analyst might able extract embedded data, still find encryption key (as hidden file usually encrypted too). Steganography useful. Using digital watermarking, author embed hidden message file ownership intellectual property proved. Artists post artwork website, others claim ownership work, artist prove ownership recover watermark. Steganography ha also number nefarious applications. Criminals easier hide record illegal activity financial crimes, terrorist easier exchange messages. Steganalysis analysis steganography, involves detection hidden data, extraction hidden message, sometimes alteration hidden message recipient cannot extract it, receive different message. Many steganalysis tool signature-based (similar antivirus intrusion detection systems). also anomaly-based steganalysis systems, flexible better new steganography techniques. New complex steganography method continue emerge. Spread-spectrum steganography method similar spread-spectrum radio transmission (where signal spread across wide-frequency spectrum rather focused single frequency, effort make detection jamming difficult). spread-spectrum steganography, small distortion image le detectable bright colors, hidden message stored bright color only, color. also check Biosteganography link top webpage. Case study, steganography used espionage, organized crime, terrorism. Consider following scenario. Every Friday afternoon (for target's time zone) member foreign state-sponsored group put item sale eBay, post photograph item. item sale real, sold according rule eBay. Bids accepted, money collected, item delivered. photograph item hide message, one many million photo found eBay. Anybody world download photo, member foreign state-sponsored group know extract encrypted message decrypt it. do? Corporate security acceptable use policies, detail employee authorized within corporate environment, always help must first line defense. Awareness training employees, explains reason respect policy includes modus operandi risk steganography attack paramount importance. User policy explain prohibited, provide organization legal mean punish prosecute violators. must clearly explain policy every line code piece software approved, strictly prohibited. way, avoid following: - anti-forensics tool (used thwart digital forensic investigations, like drive wiping tools, cache history erasers, file property time alternators, VPNs, e-mail, chat log erasers), - encryption steganography tool (there 1,000 free steganography tool online, dangerous everybody downloads "free" tool, even visit websites. website read: "This application doe require installation. copy program file external data device, run computer get hand on, click button. adding new item Windows registry hard drive without approval, installers usually do, leave trace behind"), - exploit kit (programs designed exploit known vulnerability piece software online resource. often distributed package, enable attacker limited knowledge launch sophisticated attacks), - toolkits (that enable unsophisticated user construct new malware applications, sometimes detectable standard signature-based virus scanning engines), - keyloggers (designed covertly monitor keystroke device. device ha compromised, keystrokes, including passwords, monitored, recorded), - password cracking tool (designed break password-protected file accounts), - sniffer (that capture analyze network traffic. Many protocols, including FTP chat, encrypted. program obtain cleartext information, also collect packet used crack network password find protected files, servers, user accounts), - spyware tool (for industrial espionage, unauthorized monitoring, collection proprietary data), - piracy tool (that allow user bypass copyright protection various form media, making illegal copies, saving storage medium). unlimited method steganography, imagination limit. usually learn encrypted message hidden large file (images, sound files, video etc.), nothing more.

Latin, procuro mean manage, administer - pro (on behalf of) curo (I care for). Today proxy person entity authorized act behalf another person entity. Countries expand global intelligence footprint better support growing political, economic, security interest around world, increasingly challenging existing alliance partnerships. employ array tools, especially influence campaigns, advance interest undermine interest countries. turn power vacuum opportunity. Countries use proxy (state-sponsored groups, organizations, organized crime, etc.) way accomplish national objective limiting cost, reducing risk direct conflict, maintaining plausible deniability. plausible deniability, even target country able attribute attack actor, unable provide evidence link exists actor country sponsor attack. According Tim Maurer, proxy intermediary conduct directly contributes offensive cyber operation enabled knowingly, actively passively, beneficiary gain advantage effect. Cyber proxy valuable actor political warfare. employment military, intelligence, diplomatic, financial, means, short conventional war, achieve national objectives. encompasses exploitation computer network platforms, electronic warfare, psychological operations, information operations. countries, main battlespace mind. information psychological warfare, country morally psychologically depress enemy armed force personnel civil population. 2019, United States spent $732 billion defense, compared Russias $65.1 billion. obvious Russia country similar position try find le expensive mean counter big, expensive U.S. weapon systems. Cyber espionage especially economical country conduct activity proxies. Countries actively create fertile ground malicious activity occur. Cyber actor (which include cyber criminals, hacktivists, political, economic religious groups) continually operating within sphere influence sponsoring country understanding illegal activity tolerated, soon also support objective sponsoring country. John Carlin, former Assistant U.S. Attorney General National Security ha stated, youre seeing world sophisticated intelligence operation come cyber espionage, using criminal group intelligence ends, protecting law enforcement. Cyber threat posed cyber proxy must managed, law must changed area. Publicly attributing malicious cyber activity country timely manner holding country accountable difficult, necessary. international law unable solve problems, national policy ignore international law confront cyber adversary rapid attribution offensive countermeasures, deter future aggression. COVID-19 cyber proxy COVID-19 pandemic ha disrupted life worldwide, far-reaching effect extend well beyond global health economic, political, security spheres. economic political implication pandemic ripple world years. raising geopolitical tensions, many country try take advantage situation increase influence. economic fallout pandemic likely create worsen instability many countries, people face challenge include economic downturns, job losses, disrupted supply chains. hard-hit developing country experiencing financial humanitarian crises, increasing risk surge migration, collapsed governments, internal conflict. COVID-19 pandemic prompting shift security priority country around world. public private sector try cut budgets, gap emerging training risk management. gap likely grow. Cyber proxy consider Covid-19 pandemic major opportunity spread cyber pandemic infodemics (disinformation campaign use pandemic vector). influence citizen around world question policy many country divide population. also attack health care sector institution involved management crisis, make government weaker responding crisis.
