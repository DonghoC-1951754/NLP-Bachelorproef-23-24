Big Data healthcare ha often defined reference three Vs data: Volume (a large amount data), Variety (different type data), Velocity (data arriving high speed). However, notion Big Data go beyond characteristic data includes data used, captured following definition recent European Commission funded study: Big Data Health refers largely routinely automatically collected datasets, electronically captured stored. reusable sense multipurpose data compromise fusion connection existing database purpose improving health health system performance. doe refer data collected specific study. (European Commission, Study Big Data Public Health, Telemedicine Healthcare. 2016.) 2. Big Data healthcare collected analysed? Healthcare system routinely collect large amount data patient use various healthcare services. example, information fact patient ha visited doctor, well medicine prescribed would included patient record. information required provide patient optimal care, also play important role ensuring healthcare provider reimbursed services. Beyond one-dimensional collection data, computer programme help combine enrich data different sources, thus generating added value compared originally isolated datasets. broader terms, analytic method applied support stage health technology life cycle basic research (such genomics, proteomics metabolomics data) reimbursement decision (such economic modelling methods) subgroup identification (such imaging data). 3. use Big Data healthcare how? smarter use healthcare data expected improve healthcare outcome make healthcare system efficient, accessible resilient. also contribute improved research development, lead effective policy making. Big Data used especially healthcare services, academia, policy makers, industry. example use Big Data healthcare following: achieving better health outcome improving effectiveness treatment increasing patient safety monitoring healthcare service detection population-level effect efficient recruitment selection patient clinical trial 4. benefit using Big Data patients?

Linkage previously separated data set analysis using appropriate Big Data analytics offer new way accelerate research identify right treatment individual patient (personalised medicine). Access large data set give comprehensive picture patients, allows patient-related outcome measured accurately, support decision-makers shaping healthcare systems. 5. health outcomes? According explanation given International Consortium Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) 2016: Outcomes result treatment patient care most. Outcomes outputs; lab results; technical details. Theyre real-world results, like physical functioning level pain quality life. 6. value-based outcomes-focused healthcare important? One primary goal healthcare improving overall health population. Efficiently allocating fund pay care key factor, crucial scarce resource spent wisely treatment offer benefit patients, is, better outcomes. Therefore, value-based approach healthcare would ensure healthcare system receives greatest benefit investment public fund deciding treatment alternatives. 7. Big Data Better Outcomes Programme (BD4BO)? place within IMI? Big Data Better Outcomes (BD4BO) part public-private Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 (IMI-2) world largest life science public/private partnership.

Historically, Big Data ha under-utilised due lack advanced technology extract insight data sharing among national healthcare systems. Many today investment large datasets Real-World Evidence uncoordinated, duplicative, inefficient due lack agreement standardised IT-solutions. reason include: terminology outcome measure patient benefits, lack appropriate data source method collect, analyse, report use/interpret data. 13. biggest challenge facing use Big Data healthcare? many challenge overcome important are: Security: perhaps #1 concern healthcare industry protecting data vast array threats. Data capture: lack harmonised data capture system must improved increase overall quality usability Clean data: advance cleaning data needed ensure datasets accurate, consistent, relevant corrupted. Storage: volume data rapidly increasing, safe cost-effective storage data critical ever. Curation: developing complete, accurate up-to-date metadata vital data governance plan. Querying/sharing: data silo interoperability problem prevent query tool accessing information. Standardisation use common language help ensure completeness accuracy stored data facilitate data sharing. Reporting: again, ensure consistency completeness, data reporting must standarised. Updating: data static often requires updates. Organisations must ensure understand data updated manually vs. automated creating unnecessary costly duplicate records. 14. policy maker reacted Big Data development healthcare? European policy maker made Big Data healthcare political priority. led creation partnership EC European pharmaceutical industry represented EFPIA European Federation Pharmaceutical Industries Associations. Following this, Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 (IMI2), budget almost 3.3 billion, wa created run 2014 -2020. represents world largest life science public/private partnership! 15. doe high value treatment mean? contribute effective care? High value treatment mean health outcome achieved per euro spent. maximising matter patient uniting interest healthcare stakeholders. definition, goal make significant stride pharma ability anticipate, prevent treat broad spectrum life-threatening disease across entire treatment pathway. achieved maximising transformational potential Big Data. 16. volume healthcare data likelihood targeted fraudsters increases, measure taken protect private data? like financial data managed bank, data protection industry continues work diligently stay ahead fraudsters safeguard integrity healthcare data. Patients ultimate beneficiary improved outcomes, encouraged active supporter contributor initiative like BD4BO. Patient information anonymous patient always right opt-out data-sharing system.
