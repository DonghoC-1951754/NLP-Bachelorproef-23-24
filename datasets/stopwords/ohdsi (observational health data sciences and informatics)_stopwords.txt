Vision world observational research produce comprehensive understanding health disease. Values Innovation: Observational research field benefit greatly disruptive thinking. actively seek encourage fresh methodological approach work. Reproducibility: Accurate, reproducible, well-calibrated evidence necessary health improvement. Community: Everyone welcome actively participate OHDSI, whether patient, health professional, researcher, someone simply belief cause. Collaboration: work collectively prioritize address real world need community participants. Openness: strive make community proceeds open publicly accessible, including methods, tool evidence generate. Beneficence: seek protect right individual organization within community times. 2024 powered Top | | | Areas Focus Areas Focus Data standardization want achieve quality, efficiency, transparency observational research, need standardize structure, content, analytics way optimally support specific use cases. adopted (CDM) platform that. also developing special open-source tool process help implement OMOP CDM associated standardized analytics tool within institutions. Medical product safety surveillance Mankind ought way know evaluate potential association exposure medical product adverse effects. want address gap establishing international risk identification analysis system available public. enable proactive detection potential drug effects. end, currently developing large-scale analytics allow real-time exploration medical product health outcome interest. also establishing open-source evidence repository anybody organization observational data wish contribute objective produce (using open-source tools) share evidence, learn other. Comparative effectiveness research Similarly, public also deserves understand alternative treatment able make direct comparison effectiveness alternatives. developing open-source tool generate evidence observational health data. Unlike safety surveillance tools, seek address question, medical product cause outcome?, CER tool seek answer, medical product cause outcome le alternative product could consider purpose?. Personalized risk prediction Patient-level predictive modeling complement population-level estimation, go beyond answering societal policy question average treatment effect deliver individualized insight personalized future risk experiencing outcome given know past: specific demographics, medical history prior health behaviors. developing advanced algorithm able produce personalized estimates, delivering tool communicate risk information directly patients. Data characterization learn observational health data generate reliable transparent real-world evidence, must understand underlying source data. Much research involves analysis data captured purpose research insurance claim financial transaction data support provider-payer reimbursement process, electronic health record system support provider clinical care. Therefore, critically important understand data come why, help interpret means. developing tool data quality assessment database profiling know database cannot used, data issue require consideration analysis. Quality improvement Health system continuously seek improve quality care provided patients. developing open-source tool make job easier systematic application quality measure within observational data OMOP common data model. supporting effort design, development, evaluation new empirical-evidence-based quality measures. 2024 powered Top | | | Serve Serve work benefit range individual organizations, including patients, providers, researchers, well health care systems, industry, government agencies. benefit achieved improving quality healthcare data analytics well usefulness healthcare data stakeholders.

Health Care Providers Medical decision-making difficult. Patients provider alike often challenged trying keep latest information alternative treatments, increasing pressure learn real world experience patient inform best clinical practice. OHDSI working platform generate real-world evidence actionable health system population level well individualized patient level. Patients & Consumers point life become patients, high-quality medical care one generic need mankind. care must based quantitative hard evidence available treatment options. Today, lot evidence available patient directly, usually limited describing effect treatment population. example, may able answer broad question population level like, Drug cause bleeding? could address question patient level: likelihood Drug cause bleed? based available known factor like medical history health behaviors? isnt established way generate kind evidence reliably.

Interested providing support OHDSI? different way provide funding OHDSI collaborative. Perhaps straightforward approach provide unrestricted grant OHDSI central coordinating center Columbia University. money would go providing foundational support entire collaborative, would used support personnel shared infrastructure. also directly fund specific body work grant contract OHDSI collaborating organizations. example, particularly interested seeing development HOMER advanced, support could used fund programmer staff get application production. case project requires collaboration institutions, one institution could lead investigator group coordinate subcontract participating institutions. term order magnitude support, type funding opportunity team actively soliciting usually involve direct cost paid per year 3-5 year commitment. length commitment particularly important, project involve academic collaborator needing make sustained commitment graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, research staff. majority funding go direct cost associated personnel, money may also allocated technical infrastructure licenses. Another opportunity contribute would fund acquisition licensing patient-level database placed within OHDSI central coordinating center infrastructure used analysis. example, may interest learning use new de-identified EHR dataset commercial organization license researchers. OHDSI could safe place bring data central environment. There, standardized analytics help understand type question data source reliably address. Typically, de-identified patient-level database would carry license cost paid per year course project, cost varies substantially data source. would additional resource needed host data perform data standardization necessary learn data.
