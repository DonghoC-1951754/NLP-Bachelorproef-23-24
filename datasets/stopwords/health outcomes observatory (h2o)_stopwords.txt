Das Ziel von H2O ist es, die Forschung durch umfassende Datensammlung voranzutreiben und damit bessere Ergebnisse fr PatientInnen zu erzielen. hnlich wie bereits etablierte Beobachtungszentren den Niederlanden, sterreich und Spanien wird auch da deutsche Beobachtungszentrum, H2O e.V., den Fokus auf die Bedrfnisse der PatientInnen legen. Kontrolliert von PatientInnen, sollen Erkenntnisse au der realen Welt praxisnaher Weise gesammelt werden einschlielich den Erfahrungen der Patienten und Patientinnen. Dabei werden die Daten einheitlich erfasst, um die Kommunikation zwischen PatientInnen und rztInnen zu verbessern, und Forschungsergebnisse besser nutzbar zu machen. Der H2O e.V. startet zu einem Zeitpunkt, dem die Diskussionen um die Erneuerung de Gesundheitswesens Deutschland auf einem Hhepunkt sind. Debatten um die geplante Krankenhausreform, die Elektronische Gesundheitsakte und die steigenden Kosten fr die gesetzliche Krankenversicherung zeigen verdeutlichen die Notwendigkeit von Vernderungen. Der deutsche Ableger de H2O knnte einen Beitrag zur Lsung dieser Probleme leisten. Er wurde von einem Konsortium angesehener PartnerInnen gegrndet, die sich fr positiven Vernderungen im Gesundheitswesen einsetzen. ber H2O Das Health Outcomes Observatory (H2O) ist ein ffentlich-privates Konsortium, da Patienten, Leistungserbringer, Regulierungsbehrden und Entscheidungstrger de Gesundheitswesens zusammenbringt. Das gemeinsame Ziel ist, Patient:innen den Mittelpunkt einer wertorientierten Gesundheitsversorgung zu stellen. Dazu werden die von den Patient:innen berichteten subjektiven Wahrnehmungen (Patient Reported Outcomes, PROs) standardisiert erfasst und die Entscheidungsfindung einbezogen. Wenn rzt:innen und Patient:innen eine gemeinsame Sprache sprechen, ergeben sich daraus Vorteile, wie verbesserte Kommunikation, Einblicke die Realitt von Patientenpopulationen, hhere Versorgungsqualitt und nachhaltige Gesundheitsversorgung. H2O wird derzeit mehreren Standorten Europa eingerichtet.
