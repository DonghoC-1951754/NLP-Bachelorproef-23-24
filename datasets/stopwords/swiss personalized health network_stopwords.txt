Switzerland ha numerous laws, ordinance policy regulate sharing health data research. addition, SPHN ha laid important foundation enable promote responsible ethically correct sharing health data. include SPHN Semantic Interoperability Strategy, comprehensive contractual framework, e.g. SPHN Ethical Framework legal templates. addition, BioMedIT network provides secure trustworthy environment analyzing sensitive health data. practice, however, still uncertainty ambiguities, especially exchanging data international level third parties. multi-centric National Data Streams, jointly funded SPHN ETH-Domain program Personalized Health Related Technologies exemplified uncertainties. study recently published Swiss Medical Weekly provides new insights. study wa led Effy Vayena, long-standing chair SPHN ELSIag, ETH Zurich, Kelly Ormond, collaboration SPHN, , . majority stakeholder surveyed semi-structured interview believe complex confusing aspect data exchange lie actual data transfer itself, associated process systems. uncertainty relate data protection laws, data ownership issue process anonymisation pseudonymisation. study concludes facilitating data access exchange Switzerland primarily requires legal clarification, training investment sustainable infrastructures.
