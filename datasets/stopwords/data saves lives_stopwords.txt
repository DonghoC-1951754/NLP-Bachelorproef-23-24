RWD collected? Patient registry organised way collecting RWD using observational method following patient time. may organised either disease product (treatment) registries. registry SMA disease registries, enrolling patient regardless treatment status characterise natural history disease (which often limited rare disease) well effectiveness real-world safety different SMA treatments. Collating patient information disease registry help avoid fragmented siloed approach collecting RWD, may arise data gathered individual product registries. wa health data used?At time initial EU marketing authorisation May 2017 first treatment SMA, completed clinical trial included participant different ages, disease stages, severity, limited data adults. Since time, evidence ha collected clinical practice support inform safe effective use treatment adults. includes RWD generated collaborative network SMA disease registries, participating patient provided consent data used research purposes.In 2022, product information wa updated reflect additional data clinical effectiveness SMA adult type II III patients. Also, real-world safety data adult population shown consistent known safety profile treatment derived clinical trials. [label] update mean adult SMA treating physician greater understanding efficacy safety treatment broader population.This case study example RWD used provide additional useful information patient healthcare professionals.

Medication adherence significant issue many patient co-morbidities Cardiovascular disease (CVDs) common cause death worldwide. World Health Organization (WHO) estimate 17.9 million people died CVDs 2019, equating 32% global deaths. Many patient multiple CVD risk factors, high blood pressure, high cholesterol high lipids, therefore require multiple different treatment manage conditions. However, study shown real-world settings, treatment adherence poor patient group., Understanding treatment adherence complex issue, many factor contributing towards this, patient personality, socio-economic status, ability communicate clinical team. Low adherence reduces treatment benefit patient turn place significant burden healthcare system treatment take longer. Therefore, urgent need simplify treatment regimen existing best class molecule increase adherence improve clinical outcomesRWD valuable source patient information One study, focus case study, looked determine number patient might eligible triple fixed-dose treatment (a single tablet combining atorvastatin/perindopril/amlodipine (CTAPA)), estimate unmet medical need exists among patients. Patient anonymity paramount ethical research wa observational retrospective study based data 2,292 adult patients, wa obtained three Italian Local Health Units. patient wa identified database anonymous code, therefore identifier related patient provided researchers. result produced aggregated summary (collective data), possible assign, either directly indirectly, individual patients. RWD data used understand current unmet need patient prescription CTAPA individual tablets, study found around half (54%) patient took treatment prescribed. finding allowed team estimate clear unmet need. Considering total Italian national population, approximately 69,665 patient high blood pressure potentially eligible treatment fixed-dose combination therapy 2014, may improved adherence.This excellent example RWD used provide evidence important unmet need, could identified using real-world evidence analysis. finding help healthcare professional researcher explore possible interventions, case, could simplified treatment regime (fixed-dose combination medicine) may improve adherence levels. information High Blood Pressure & Cardiovascular Prevention (2019) 26:399-404 Special thanks Samuele Doratori, Head Cardiometabolic Venous Diseases Global Medical Patient Affairs (GMPA), SERVIER, Valerie Lehner-Martin, Medical Excellence Real-World Director, GMPA SERVIER , Luca Degli Esposti, CEO, CliCon S.r.l.
