Open science transparent accessible knowledge shared developed collaborative networks. encompasses practice publishing open research, campaigning open access, encouraging scientist practice open-notebook science, generally making easier publish communicate scientific knowledge. Personal data:According Article 3 (1) Regulation (EU) 2018/1725: "personal data mean information relating identified identifiable natural person (data subject); identifiable natural person one identified, directly indirectly, particular reference identifier name, identification number, location data, online identifier one factor specific physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural social identity natural person".Name social security number two example personal data relate directly person. However, definition extends also encompasses instance e-mail address office phone number employee. example personal data found information physical disabilities, medical record employee's evaluation. Personal data processed relation work data subject remain personal/individual sense continue protected relevant data protection legislation, strives protect privacy integrity natural persons. consequence, data protection legislation doe address situation legal person (apart exceptional case information legal person also relates physical person). Personal data breach: breach security leading accidental unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, access to, personal data transmitted, stored otherwise processed. Population Health Data/Health information: organised contextualised data health health service activity performance, individual population level, fit-for-use contributes health promotion, prevention, care policy-making. Primary use data: use data purpose wa originally collected. Processing (personal non-personal): operation set operation performed data datasets, whether automated means, collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosureby transmission, dissemination otherwise making available, alignment combination, restriction, erasure destruction. Profiling: form automated processing personal data consisting use personal data evaluate certain personal aspect relating natural person, particular analyse predict aspect concerning natural person's performance work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location movements. Pseudonymisation: processing personal data manner personal data longer attributed specific data subject without use additional information, provided additional information kept separately subject technical organisational measure ensure personal data attributed identified identifiable natural person. Public health monitoring reporting: activity necessary obtain health data information bring information health policy practice. Research Network: Research Network (RN) active networkof national and/or regional expert several country perform comparative research specific health area (information domain). Restriction processing (personal non-personal data): defined GDPR, method restrict processing data could include, inter alia, temporarily moving selected data another processing system, making selected personal data unavailable users, temporarily removing published data website. automated filing systems, restriction processing principle ensured technical mean manner personal data subject processing operation cannot changed. fact processing data restricted clearly indicated system. Secondary use data/data re-use:Secondary use refers using data different purpose one wa originally collected (i.e. primary use). According European Data Governance Act 2020 re-use mean use natural legal person data held public sector bodies, commercial noncommercial purpose initial purpose within public task data produced, except exchange data public sector body purely pursuit public tasks. Clinical definition: Secondary use health data applies personal health information (PHI) us outside direct health care delivery. Secure processing environment: physical virtual environment organisational mean provide opportunity re-use data manner allows operator secure processing environment determine supervise data processing actions, including display, storage, download, export data calculation derivative data computational algorithms. Sensitive data: Information regulated law due possible risk plants, animals, individual and/or community public private organisations. Sensitive personal data include information related racial ethnic origin, political opinions, religious philosophical beliefs, trade union membership data concerning health sex life individual. data could identifiable potentially cause harm disclosure. Synthetic data:The concept synthetic data generation take original data source (dataset) create new, artificial data, similar statistical property it. Keeping statistical property mean anyone analysing synthetic data, data analyst example, able draw statistical conclusion analysis given dataset synthetic data he/she would given real (original) data. use synthetic data growing many fields: training artificial intelligence model within health sector computer vision, image recognition robotics fields. Synthetic data confused "mockup data", which, although close, synonymous.
