Fig.: Certification Process Assurance Level 1 Assurance Level 2 3 Assurance Level 2 3 require independent evaluation facility conduct evaluation component operational environment. applicant must contract evaluation facility. Together, applicant evaluation facility finalize application certification certification body. Afterwards, evaluation facility responsible carrying evaluation according IDS certification scheme. evaluation facility document progress finding evaluation report passed certification body end evaluation phase. certification phase, certification body examines evaluation report issue certificate, evaluation wa conducted properly led positive evaluation result. IDS Certification criterion IDS Certification ensures IDS component organization individual want participate data sharing meet highest security standards. standard industry-proven security criterion derived ISO/IEC 27001 (international standard information security management) IEC 62443 (cybersecurity operational technology automation control systems). addition, IDS Certification implement security criterion defined Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue(C5) CSA Cloud Controls Matrix. Finally, IDS certification capture IDS specific criteria. certification criterion defined IDS Certification criterion catalogs. IDS Certification trust level IDS Certification ensures IDS component organization individual want participate data sharing provide sufficiently high degree trust security. Nevertheless, IDS Certification ha flexible setup provides different level certification according intended use cases. ensure one hand low entry barrier specifically suitable SMEs hand scalable certification meet high information security requirements, three different security levels, increasing extent security requirement need fulfilled, defined: Criteria IDS Connector certification Three different trust levels, increasing extent security requirement need fulfilled, defined: Trust 1: offer basic security feature protect attacker outside, ensure integrity availability. therefore designed use scenario low security requirements. Connector meeting profile suitable exchanging data limited trust security needs, exchange data contained environment demonstration purposes. Trust 2: includes strict container isolation, integrity-protected logging, encryption persisted data, protection accidental misuse administrators. profile used scenario protection processed transmitted data essential. Trust 3: offer additional protection misuse privileged access, i.e., manipulation administrators. includes protection insider attack well external attacker could gain privileged access. achieved actively monitoring user data behalf data owner. Criteria IDS operational environment certification operational environment certification defines three different trust levels, increasing extent security requirement need fulfilled: Trust 1: cover basic security requirement every participant International Data Space need fulfil. entry level therefore serf low barrier company (especially SMEs) interested trying International Data Space participation. Trust 2: cover additional security requirements, ensuring advanced level security. level suit-able core participants.

SUCCESS: objective facilitate reliable seamless flow data OEM supplier establishing dedicated data space. developed solution seamlessly integrated pre-existing infrastructure company solution grounded framework IDS reference architecture. OEM selectively disclose data production environment supplier without fear data leakages. Respectively, supplier receives data essential need locally extract meaningful insight valuable information big data sets. BENEFITS: established data space solution ha potential significantly enhance transparency OEM supplier. give rise several potential benefits, including: Effective Communication: Transparent communication help conveying accurate information product specifications, requirements, changes, timelines. Risk Management: Sharing information potential risks, change demand design modifications, allows supplier proactively address issues. Furthermore, time disruptions, supply shortage unexpected market shifts, transparent communication help party respond effectively. Cost Efficiency: Transparent communication allows party work together find cost-effective solutions. COMPONENTS: IDS connector - serve communication interface linking two company existing systems. IDS connectors, data provider define rule condition (usage policies) data shared data consumer.
