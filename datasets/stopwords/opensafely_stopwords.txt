Designed provide secure federated analytics, OpenSAFELY help NHS minimise sharing confidential patient information.Pseudonymisation access controlsTo understand technical design choice OpenSAFELY, helpful first understand privacy disclosure risk tool aim mitigate. Pseudonymisation widely used process protecting patient privacy whereby explicit identifier names, addresses, date birth removed patient medical record used shared. Pseudonymisation necessary protect patient privacy, sufficient safeguard own. example, pseudonymisation might help prevent researcher accidentally seeing piece information someone know, flashing past screen; beyond this, doe little preserve privacy. example, comprehensive set NHS patient records, someone misusing data could easily find read Tony Blairs entire health record searching patient match information openly available Wikipedia page: age, approximate date wa treated abnormal heart rhythm, fact lived London.Because kind re-identification easy, believe detailed pseudonymised health data handled identifiable, taking reasonable technical step prevent detect misuse data: disseminated little possible; accessed environment best prevent researcher ever needing even view underlying raw data; managed setting comprehensive log action kept, ideally shared, form easily reviewed scale. technical safeguard sit alongside widely implemented administrative safeguard scrutinise proposed analysis likely public benefit, evaluate user ensure analyst accessing data trustworthy: function support .Core Design Features Privacy, Transparency, Open WorkingOpenSAFELY aim substantially exceed, design, current requirement securing sensitive healthcare data.OpenSAFELY doe move patient data outside secure environment already resides: instead, trusted analyst run large scale computation across pseudonymised patient record situ, near-real-time.In case OpenSAFELY-TPP OpenSAFELY-EMIS, implemented OpenSAFELY inside data centre largest provider GP electronic health record software England, location patient record already reside. mean data never move location.

Designed provide secure federated analytics, OpenSAFELY help NHS minimise sharing confidential patient information.Pseudonymisation access controlsTo understand technical design choice OpenSAFELY, helpful first understand privacy disclosure risk tool aim mitigate. Pseudonymisation widely used process protecting patient privacy whereby explicit identifier names, addresses, date birth removed patient medical record used shared. Pseudonymisation necessary protect patient privacy, sufficient safeguard own. example, pseudonymisation might help prevent researcher accidentally seeing piece information someone know, flashing past screen; beyond this, doe little preserve privacy. example, comprehensive set NHS patient records, someone misusing data could easily find read Tony Blairs entire health record searching patient match information openly available Wikipedia page: age, approximate date wa treated abnormal heart rhythm, fact lived London.Because kind re-identification easy, believe detailed pseudonymised health data handled identifiable, taking reasonable technical step prevent detect misuse data: disseminated little possible; accessed environment best prevent researcher ever needing even view underlying raw data; managed setting comprehensive log action kept, ideally shared, form easily reviewed scale. technical safeguard sit alongside widely implemented administrative safeguard scrutinise proposed analysis likely public benefit, evaluate user ensure analyst accessing data trustworthy: function support .Core Design Features Privacy, Transparency, Open WorkingOpenSAFELY aim substantially exceed, design, current requirement securing sensitive healthcare data.OpenSAFELY doe move patient data outside secure environment already resides: instead, trusted analyst run large scale computation across pseudonymised patient record situ, near-real-time.In case OpenSAFELY-TPP OpenSAFELY-EMIS, implemented OpenSAFELY inside data centre largest provider GP electronic health record software England, location patient record already reside. mean data never move location.

Standardising data management pathway way brings numerous benefit around re-usability, efficiency, security, transparency.All code created data management analysis shared, informatively, review re-use subsequent users. setting NHS patient data analysis data management task achieved huge range bespoke duplicative methods, huge range different tools, single task often spread platform programming languages.

Methods approval NHS England, cohort study wa conducted 57.9 million patient record general practice England, situ within infrastructure electronic health record software vendor EMIS TPP using OpenSAFELY. Vaccine coverage across various subgroup Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation (JCVI) priority cohort described. Results total 20 852 692 patient (36.0%) received vaccine 8 December 2020 17 March 2021. patient aged 80 year care home (JCVI group 2) 94.7% received vaccine, substantial variation ethnicity (White 96.2%, Black 68.3%) deprivation (least deprived 96.6%, deprived 90.7%). Patients pre-existing medical condition likely vaccinated two exceptions: severe mental illness (89.5%) learning disability (91.4%). 275 205 vaccine recipient identified care home resident (JCVI group 1; 91.2% coverage). 17 March, 1 257 914 (6.0%) recipient second dose. Conclusions NHS rapidly delivered mass vaccination. study data-monitoring framework wa deployed using publicly auditable method secure situ processing model, using linked pseudonymised patient-level NHS data 57.9 million patients.
